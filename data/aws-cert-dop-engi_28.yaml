    Pearson VUE site does say that a beverage in any container is allowed. If you

    exam in a testing center and taking the exam via an online proctor. One of the
    other major differences is that at the online testing center, you are given 2-3

    even greater push than from the early days to get you certified and gain access
    to the certification lounge. Taking the certification test in this type of environment
    is unlike any other. There are rows of computer screens and people packed side
    by side in a large conference room, staring quietly at the various tests they
    are trying to take. As you are trying to concentrate on your exam, you cannot
    help but see the various other people finishing and getting up and sitting down
    repeatedly. It becomes distracting, and sometimes, thoughts will wander in your

    the re:Invent conference is that there are a lot of extra-curricular activities
    going on, especially at night, many times with one or more adult beverages. This
    can draw you away from the quiet time that you need to do the final preparations

    reading and comprehension as much as it is on AWS services and knowledge. Skimming
    through the questions and answers can lead to missing a critical piece of information
    and therefore missing the question altogether. Even though you only have around
    2 and a half minutes to read, comprehend, and answer each of the questions, each
    of those questions must be carefully read for the correct details and components.
    Practicing reading the large question format is an important key to success, I
    have found. The ability to focus on this long format exam can help, especially
    when you look up at the timer and see that the minutes are running down and there
    are still several questions that you need to answer.

- en: Don't second guess yourself too much by marking lots of questions to review.
    Most of the time, your initial choice will be your best choice. I have had some
    handwringing instances in the past with taking certification tests where I marked
    5-7 questions for review and changed my initial answer on at least four questions
    only to fail the test by 1-2 questions when the scoring finally came out. Did
    I miss the questions where I changed the answer at the end of the test? I cannot
    say definitively since AWS does not give you feedback on those types of metrics,
    but I have since changed the way that I use the review button. If I am having
    a hard time understanding the question and/or the answers, I will select something
    and then go on to the next question.

    1-2 个问题而没能通过。那些我在考试结束时更改的答案，是否错了呢？我不能明确回答，因为 AWS 不会提供这些类型的反馈，但我已经改变了自己使用复查按钮的方式。如果我对问题和/或答案感到难以理解，我会选择一个答案然后继续答下一个问题。

    you take the professional level exam, I would not suggest just jumping right to
    the professional-level test. Sitting the exam for either the AWS SysOps Associate
    or the Developer Associate certification, which was once part of the necessary
    prerequisites to taking the DevOps professional exam, gives you a proper warmup
    to taking the professional-level exam. Even in my recertification, I usually take
    the lower test so that I can judge what new services and questions they have added
    to the exam in a simpler format, before going after the professional-level recertification
    a few weeks later.

    for this is for the actual pieces of paper that you get. The night before taking
    the exam, practice with a blank sheet of paper and write some quick notes on the
    main heading topics that can just jog your memory, as shown in the preceding figure.
    I would practice this about 3-5 times the night before the test so that I could
    do this in less than 5 minutes once I was seated at my terminal at the testing
    center, as I was typing in my username and testing ID, but before I would press
    the start button. I used to teach this technique in the AWS meetup group I ran
    for 6 years, where many of the members used to challenge each other on accomplishing
    multiple levels of AWS certifications. You can't bring any type of cheat sheet
    into the testing center. You are only quickly dumping out information from your
    brain onto the scratch piece of paper provided and then handing that piece of
    paper back to the testing center once you are finished with the test. You can
    refer to these quick notes as the test is taking place; however, since you created
    them, it allows you to take a breath and relax while concentrating on reading
    and comprehending the questions.

  zh: 我建议去考试中心参加考试。这样做的主要原因之一是你会获得实际的纸质考试证书。在考试前一天晚上，拿一张空白纸，练习写下有关主要主题的快速笔记，这些笔记可以帮助你回忆起一些要点，正如前面的图示所示。我通常会在考试前的晚上练习这个过程3-5次，这样当我坐在考试中心的计算机前，输入用户名和考试ID时，我可以在不到5分钟的时间内完成这一过程，然后按下开始按钮。我曾在我运营了6年的AWS技术交流小组里教授过这种技巧，很多成员曾互相挑战，在多个AWS认证的不同级别上取得成就。你不能将任何类型的备忘单带入考试中心。你只是在考前将信息快速从脑中记下来，写在提供的草稿纸上，考试结束后再将草稿纸交还给考试中心。你可以在考试过程中参考这些快速笔记；然而，由于它们是你自己制作的，这可以让你在专心阅读和理解题目时放松并深呼吸。
