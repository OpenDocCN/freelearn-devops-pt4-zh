- en: In [Chapter 1](4ca6da75-a952-4ea8-9137-19cbc1d21012.xhtml), *The Evolution of
    Software Delivery*, you were introduced to ACME systems and given an insight into
    how it realized that there were problems with its software delivery process (severely
    impacting its ability to meet the expectations of its customers and deliver value
    to them), how it identified and addressed these problems, evolved, and after some
    hard work, determination, and time, adopted CD and DevOps ways of working to overcome
    them.

  zh: 在[第1章](4ca6da75-a952-4ea8-9137-19cbc1d21012.xhtml)《软件交付的演变》中，你被介绍了ACME系统，并了解了它是如何意识到软件交付过程中存在问题（严重影响了它满足客户期望并为客户创造价值的能力），以及它是如何识别并解决这些问题，进化并在经过一番努力、决心和时间后，采用了CD和DevOps的工作方式来克服这些问题的。
- en: The story based upon a fictional business is pretty simplistic and linear to
    make it easier for you the reader to follow. Real life is never that simple, but
    there are a number of key points that were raised during the storytelling that
    do apply to real-life businesses. The most important of these for any business
    considering—or actively pursuing—the adoption of CD and/or DevOps is that there
    has to be a reason for said adoption. CD and DevOps, like any solution, can help
    you solve a problem—or set of problems—but you need to truly understand and quantify
    the problem(s) beforehand; otherwise, you'll never know for sure whether the solution
    has helped.

    to this—I would like to turn to the world of art. The artist Banksy exhibited
    a piece of living artwork as part of his 2006 Barely Legal exhibition in Los Angeles.
    This living artwork was in the form of an adult Indian elephant standing in a
    makeshift living room with floral print on the walls. The elephant was also *painted*
    head to toe with the same floral pattern. The piece was entitled—as luck would
    have it—elephant in the room. It seems ludicrous at first and you can clearly
    see that there is a massive 12,000 lb. elephant standing there; while it has been
    painted to blend in with its surroundings, it is still a massive elephant stood
    there in plain sight. This brings me to my point, the problems and issues within
    a software delivery process are just like the elephant and it is just as ludicrous
    that we simply ignore—or accept without question—their existence.

    a little more time to ensure that those key people who fit into this category

    derail the process—which again may be why they want to be involved. One word of
    warning; do not simply dismiss these individuals out of hand as they may have
    valuable observations to bring forward and dismissing them may foster further
    negativity and make them very vocal active detractors. You should however ensure
    these individuals agree to be engaged contributors and understand the ground rules
    you have set. During the next stage, you will no doubt need to keep an eye on

    you'll also have some other ideas. As you are trying to expose problems and issues

    As with any lean methodology/tool/technique, value stream mapping revolves around
    a value versus waste model. In essence, a value stream map is a way to breakdown
    a product delivery process into a series of steps and handover points; it can
    also be used to help calculate efficiency rates if that's useful to you. The overall
    map can be laid out and analyzed to see where bottlenecks or delays occur within
    the flow; in other words, which steps are not adding value. The key metric used
    within value stream mapping is the lead time (for example, how long before the
    original idea starts making hard cash for the business).
