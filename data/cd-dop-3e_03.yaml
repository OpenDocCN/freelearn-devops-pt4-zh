    Current Pain Points*, we learned that asking people to be open and honest is not
    that easy, unless you take the time to set the environment up to allow for it.
    The environment had to be such that a culture of honest disclosure could take
    place. On top of this, you had to ensure that every participant agreed to behave
    according to the flexible rules and processes set out.

    and respects social hierarchy over individual views and opinions, then those self-same
    individuals may see openness and honesty as an unnatural or alien concept—or at

    in large organizations and/corporates that strictly follow frameworks such as
    ITIL or similar. If you also consider that this represents the happy path version
    of the process, it's not hard to imagine the loops and hoops you would have to
    go through should any problems or defects be found during the various steps (normally,
    this will mean starting back at square one). All in all, this kind of process
    would not be conducive to the adoption of CD and DevOps nor would it be closely
    aligned to a positive culture, environment, and behaviors.

    businesses that have come into being in the last decade specialize in technical
    tools targeting CD and DevOps (mainly DevOps, to be honest); however, there's
    not a vast amount of adoption of said tools outside of the traditional (Dev)Ops

    the tools—something developers don't normally have the time/inclination to understand.

    Deploy这样的工具，而运维人员应了解如何使用像Visual Studio这样的工具）。

    dialogue isn't something they would normally shy away from. Introverts, on the
    other hand, when faced with conflict (potential or otherwise), will more often
    than not simply close down or just go with the flow. You, therefore, need to be
    very mindful of this fact and ensure everyone has the opportunity to contribute

    surprises. What we're looking for is a culture, and ways of working where change
    is good and frequent, individuals work together on common goals, the wider business
    trusts the product-delivery teams to deliver what is needed when it is needed,
    and the operations teams know what is coming. If there is a high degree of visibility
    across the entire process, anyone and everyone can see this happening, and more
    importantly, how effective it is.

  zh: 正如我们之前所讨论的，对你所做的事情及其方式保密并不利于建立开放、诚实且基于信任的工作环境或文化。如果每个人都能看到正在发生的事情，那么就不会有意外发生。我们所追求的是一种文化，一种工作方式，在这种方式下，变化是好的且频繁的，个人在共同目标上协作，业务部门信任产品交付团队按时交付所需的内容，运维团队了解即将发生的事情。如果整个过程高度可见，任何人都能看到这一切，而且更重要的是，看到它有多么有效。
- en: You should look at the option of installing large screens around the office
    to display stats, facts, and figures. You might well have something like this
    set up already, but I suspect these screens display very technical information-system
    stats, CPU graphs, alerts, and so on. I also suspect that most of these reside
    in the technical team areas (development, operations, and so on). This is not
    a bad thing, it's just very specialized, and those of a nontechnical nature might
    ignore them or most likely don't even know that they exist. See whether you can
    move some of the screens to communal areas of the office or try to find some budget
    to buy new ones.

  zh: 你可以考虑在办公室周围安装大屏幕，展示统计数据、事实和数字。你可能已经设置了类似的显示系统，但我猜这些屏幕显示的是非常技术性的系统统计信息、CPU图表、警报等。我还猜大多数这样的屏幕位于技术团队的区域（开发、运维等）。这并不是坏事，只是非常专业化，非技术性人员可能会忽略它们，或者更可能根本不知道它们的存在。看看你能否将部分屏幕移动到办公室的公共区域，或者尝试找到预算购买新的屏幕。

  zh: 你还应该用非常简单、易于阅读和理解的与CD和DevOps过程相关的数据来补充这些高度技术性的内容。你应该考虑展示以下几种信息：

    complementary information and data that is business-relevant, rather than simply
    focusing on technical facts and figures. This will help to heighten engagement
    and awareness outside of the technical teams. Having this information visible
    as you progress through your adoption and implementation of CD and DevOps will
    also provide proof that things are improving.

  zh: 最后一条非常重要。你应该发布、展示和宣传与业务相关的互补信息和数据，而不仅仅是关注技术性的事实和数字。这将有助于提高技术团队以外的员工的参与度和意识。随着你在实施CD和DevOps的过程中推进，公开这些信息也将证明事情正在改善。

- en: We covered quite a lot of ground in terms of the human side of implementing
    CD and DevOps throughout this chapter. Hopefully, it has been impressed upon you
    that the culture in which you operate dictates the success of CD and DevOps. When
    it comes to collaboration, you will find that trust, honesty, and openness are
    powerful tools that allow individuals to take responsibility for their actions.
    Rewarding good behaviors and removing blame will also help drive adoption.

  zh: 本章中我们讨论了实施CD和DevOps过程中与人相关的诸多内容。希望你已经意识到，运作的文化决定了CD和DevOps的成功。在协作方面，你会发现信任、诚实和开放是强有力的工具，它们使得个人能够为自己的行为负责。奖励良好行为并去除责备也将有助于推动采纳。

    *Planning for Success*, we'll look at some practical things that will help as
