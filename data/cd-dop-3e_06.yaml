    and are proactively moving adoption forward. The followers who are moving up the
    curve may need some help to get over the crest, so more attention should be given
    to them. To focus on the *laggards* may take too much attention away from the
    majority, so the painful truth is that they either shape up or ship out—even if
    they're senior managers or leaders. This may seem rather brutal, but this approach

    what should you do? As previously pointed out, if they are loud and disruptive

    If the majority of the organization has bought into what you are doing—don''t
    forget that you are executing a plan based upon their input and suggestions—they
    will not easily become distracted, and therefore you should not become distracted.

    things more difficult—especially if they are good at playing the political games
    that go on in any business. However, as stated previously, they will ultimately
    be fighting a losing battle as the majority will be behind the goal and vision.
    If you have an executive sponsor or someone influential within leadership who
    is in the innovators or followers camp, ask them to get involved. You just need

    becoming a major issue. The nip-it-in-the-bud part can be in the form of a simple,
    non-confrontational face-to-face discussion with the potential troublemaker over
    a coffee—that way, the *dissenter* feels that they are being listened to and you
    get an understanding of what the noise is all about. As a last resort, a face-to-face

- en: During phase 2.0 of their evolution, ACME systems became part of a large corporate.
    They ended up as a satellite office, the corporate HQ being overseas and, on the
    whole, were left to their own devices. They beavered away for a while and started
    to examine and implement CD and DevOps. They were doing so, when viewed at a global
    corporate level, in isolation. Yes, they were making far-reaching and dramatic
    changes to the ACME systems organization, but they were a small cog in a very
    big wheel. No one outside of the ACME systems offices had much visibility or in-depth
    knowledge of what was going on. Consequently, when a new, far-reaching, corporate
    strategic plan related to the global downsizing of the operations organization
    was announced, little or no consideration was given to what ACME systems were
    up to, as, in all honesty, no one making the decisions really knew. As a result,
    the progress of the CD and DevOps implementation very quickly ground to a halt.
    As luck would have it, once the dust had settled, the need for DevOps became even
    greater than it was originally, which lead to a greater focus and acceleration
    in adoption.

- en: 'ACME systems implemented a deployment transaction model (covered in a previous
    chapter) to manage dependencies and ensure only one change went through to the
    production system at any one point in time. This worked well for a while, but
    things started to slow down. Automated integration tests that were previously
    working started to fail intermittently, defects were being raised in areas of
    functionality that were previously seen as bulletproof. This slowdown started
    to impact the wider R&D team''s ability to deliver and the noise level started
    to rise, especially from the vocal laggards. Open and honest discussions between
    all concerned ensued and, after much debate, it transpired that the main source
    of the problem was a very simple dependency, and change management was not keeping
    up with the speed of delivery. In essence, there was no sure way of determining
    which software asset change would be completed before another software asset change
    and there was no simple way to try out different scenarios in terms of integration.
    What it boiled down to was this: if changes within asset A had a dependency on
    changes within asset B, then asset B needed to go live first to allow for full
    integration testing. However, if asset A was ready first, it would have to sit
    and wait—sometimes for days or weeks. The deployment transaction was starting
    to hinder CD.'

    A 中的更改依赖于资产 B 中的更改，那么资产 B 必须首先上线，以便进行完整的集成测试。然而，如果资产 A 先准备好，就必须等待——有时可能等待数天或数周。部署事务开始妨碍持续交付（CD）。

    test integration without having everything deployed to production and the like
    live environment. This had not been a problem previously, as the speed of releases
    had been very slow and assets had been clumped together. ACME systems now had
    the ability to deploy to production very quickly and now had a new problem: which
    order to deploy? Many discussions took place and complicated options were looked
    at, but in the end the solution was quite simple: move the boundary of the deployment
    transaction and allow for full integration testing before assets went to production.

    系统能够非常快速地部署到生产环境，但也遇到了一个新问题：应该按什么顺序进行部署？经过许多讨论和复杂选项的考虑，最终解决方案相当简单：移动部署事务的边界，并允许在资产进入生产环境之前进行完整的集成测试。接下来，便是各个研发团队手动确定应该按什么顺序进行部署。

    completely ruin things, especially in the early stages of adoption. As stated
    previously, CD and DevOps are more about ways of working, behaviors, and culture
    than box-ticking and business metrics. That said, there is a reason for the decision
    to adopt CD and DevOps—to improve the ability to deliver quality software solution
    quickly and repeatedly. This will not go away simply because an org chart has
    been updated.

  zh: 当你面临一些可能相当激进的事情时，比如采用 CD 和 DevOps，董事会的一次决策可能会完全搞砸一切，尤其是在采用的初期。正如之前所说，CD 和 DevOps
    更侧重于工作方式、行为和文化，而不是单纯的填表和商业指标。话虽如此，采纳 CD 和 DevOps 是有原因的——提升快速且反复交付高质量软件解决方案的能力。这一点不会因为组织架构的更新而消失。
- en: Your best approach is to keep doing what you're doing and keep being open, honest,
    and transparent. If you have an executive sponsor who is still in situ, encourage
    them to go back on the charm offensive. Don't be afraid to cover old ground and
    reiterate the reasoning and history behind the decision. In addition, make sure
    you share good news stories and ensure that the new leaders are included in your
    regular communications. In essence, do whatever is needed to keep things rolling
    and ensure progress continues.

  zh: 你最好的做法是继续保持现状，保持开放、诚实和透明。如果你仍然有一位在职的高管赞助人，鼓励他们重新展开魅力攻势。不要害怕重复旧话题，重申决策背后的原因和历史。此外，确保分享好消息，并确保新领导人被包括在你的定期沟通中。实质上，做任何必要的事情以保持工作进展，确保持续向前。

  zh: 摘要
- en: What new things have we learned throughout this chapter? The main message is
    that change is not something to be afraid of, is something that does and will
    happen and that there will be hurdles that you will experience along the way.
    As long as you plan for and are aware of this fact and you're able help and guide
    those involved and impacted by change get through it you should be in a relatively
    good place. When hidden boulders become apparent, be that in terms of communications,
    red tape, bureaucracy, hiring or geography, you will have some ideas how to overcome
    them. Another thing you have learned is that people, be they within the inner
    circle or far removed, are key to your success.
