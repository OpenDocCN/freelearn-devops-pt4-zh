- en: Just like the other books I wrote, this one does not have a fixed scope. I did
    not start with an index. I didn’t write a summary of each chapter in an attempt
    to define the scope. I do not do such things. There is only a high-level goal
    to explore **continuous delivery and deployment inside Kubernetes clusters**.
    What I did do, though, was to set a few guidelines.

  zh: 就像我写的其他书一样，这本书并没有固定的范围。我没有从索引开始，也没有为每一章写总结以试图界定范围。我不做这些事情。这里只设定了一个高层次的目标：探讨**Kubernetes集群内部的持续交付和部署**。不过，我确实设定了几个指导原则。
- en: The first guideline is that *all the examples will be tested on all major Kubernetes
    platforms.* Well, that might be a bit far-fetched. I’m aware that any sentence
    that mentions “all” together with “Kubernetes” is bound to be incorrect. New platforms
    are popping out like mushrooms after rain. Still, what I can certainly do is to
    choose a few of the most commonly used ones.

  zh: 第一个指导原则是*所有示例将在所有主要的Kubernetes平台上进行测试*。嗯，这可能有些不切实际。我知道，任何提到“所有”和“Kubernetes”的句子都可能是错误的。新平台像雨后春笋般层出不穷。不过，我肯定能做到的是选择一些最常用的平台。
- en: '**Minikube** and **Docker for Mac or Windows** should undoubtedly be there
    for those who prefer to “play” with Docker locally.'

  zh: '**Minikube**和**Docker for Mac或Windows**无疑应当在内，适合那些喜欢在本地“玩”Docker的人。'
- en: AWS is the biggest hosting provider so **Kubernetes Operations (kops)** must
    be included as well.

  zh: AWS是最大的托管服务提供商，因此**Kubernetes Operations（kops）**必须包括在内。
- en: Since it would be silly to cover only un-managed cloud, I had to include managed
    Kubernetes clusters as well. **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** is the obvious
    choice. It is the most stable and features rich managed Kubernetes solution. Adding
    GKE to the mix means that Azure Container Service (AKS) and **Amazon’s Elastic
    Container Service (EKS)** should be included as well so that we can have the “big
    trio” of the hosting vendors that offer managed Kubernetes. Unfortunately, even
    though AKS is available, it is, at this moment (June 2018), still too unstable
    and it’s missing a lot of features. So, I’m forced to scale down from the trio
    to the GKE and EKS duo as representatives of managed Kubernetes we’ll explore.

  zh: 由于只覆盖非托管云环境是愚蠢的，我不得不包括托管的Kubernetes集群。**Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**是显而易见的选择。它是最稳定、功能最丰富的托管Kubernetes解决方案。将GKE纳入其中意味着Azure容器服务（AKS）和**Amazon的弹性容器服务（EKS）**也应当包括在内，这样我们就能拥有提供托管Kubernetes的三大云供应商。不过，尽管AKS已经可用，但截至2018年6月，它仍然不稳定，且缺少许多功能。因此，我被迫将三大平台缩小为GKE和EKS这对托管Kubernetes代表。
- en: Finally, a possible on-prem solution should be included as well. Since **OpenShift**
    shines in that area, the choice was relatively easy.
  id: totrans-6

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 最后，可能还需要包括一个本地部署解决方案。由于**OpenShift**在这方面表现出色，选择相对容易。
- en: All in all, I decided to test everything in minikube and Docker for Mac locally,
    AWS with kops as the representative of a cluster in the cloud, GKE for managed
    Kubernetes clusters, and OpenShift (with minishift) as a potential on-prem solution.
    That, in itself, already constitutes a real challenge that might prove to be more
    than I can chew. Still, making sure that all the examples work with all those
    platforms and solutions should provide some useful insights.

  zh: 总的来说，我决定在本地使用minikube和Docker for Mac进行测试，将AWS与kops作为云中集群的代表，使用GKE来测试托管的Kubernetes集群，以及使用OpenShift（搭配minishift）作为潜在的本地解决方案。光是这一点就构成了一个真正的挑战，可能超出我的能力范围。不过，确保所有示例都能在这些平台和解决方案上运行，应该会提供一些有价值的见解。
- en: Some of you already chose the Kubernetes flavor you’ll use. Others might still
    wonder whether to adopt one or the other. Even though the comparison of different
    Kubernetes platforms is not the primary scope of the book, I’ll do my best to
    explain the differences as they come.

  zh: 你们中的一些人已经选择了自己使用的Kubernetes版本。其他人可能仍在犹豫是否采用其中之一。虽然不同Kubernetes平台的比较并不是本书的主要内容，但我会尽力在有需要时解释它们之间的差异。
- en: To summarize the guidelines, it **explores continuous delivery and deployment
    in Kubernetes using Jenkins**. All the examples will be tested in **minikube,
    Docker for Mac (or Windows), AWS with kops, GKE, OpenShift with minishift, and
    EKS**.

  zh: 总结一下这些指导原则，它**探讨了使用Jenkins在Kubernetes中进行持续交付和部署**。所有示例将在**minikube、Docker for
    Mac（或Windows）、AWS与kops、GKE、OpenShift与minishift以及EKS**上进行测试。
- en: The moment I finished writing the previous paragraph I realized that I am repeating
    the same mistakes from the past. I start with something that looks like a reasonable
    scope, and I end up with something much bigger and longer. Will I be able to follow
    all of those guidelines? I honestly don’t know. I’ll do my best.

  zh: 当我写完上一段时，我意识到我正在重复过去的错误。我从看似合理的范围开始，最终却变成了更大更长的内容。我能否遵循所有这些指南？说实话，我不知道。我会尽力而为。
- en: I was supposed to follow the “best practice” by writing the overview at the
    end. I’m not doing that. Instead, you are reading about the plans for the book,
    not the end result. This is not an overview. You can consider this as the first
    page of the diary. The end of the story is still unknown.

  zh: 我本应该按照“最佳实践”在最后写概述，但我没有这么做。相反，您现在读到的是关于这本书的计划，而不是最终的结果。这不是概述。您可以把它当作日记的第一页。故事的结局仍然未知。

- en: Please note that this one, just as the previous books, is self-published. I
    believe that having no intermediaries between the writer and the reader is the
    best way to go. It allows me to write faster, update the book more frequently,
    and have more direct communication with you. Your feedback is part of the process.
    No matter whether you purchased the book while only a few or all chapters were
    written, the idea is that it will never be truly finished. As time passes, it
    will require updates so that it is aligned with the change in technology or processes.
    When possible, I will try to keep it up to date and release updates whenever that
    makes sense. Eventually, things might change so much that updates are not a good
    option anymore, and that will be a sign that a whole new book is required. **I
    will keep writing as long as I continue getting your support.**

  zh: 请注意，这本书和之前的书籍一样，都是自费出版的。我相信没有中介介入作者和读者之间是最好的方式。这让我能更快地写作，更频繁地更新书籍，并且能与您进行更直接的沟通。您的反馈是这一过程的一部分。无论您是在书中的章节还未完成时购买，还是所有章节都已写完，想法是它永远不会真正完成。随着时间的推移，它将需要更新，以便与技术或流程的变化保持一致。在可能的情况下，我会尽量保持它的更新，并在适当的时候发布更新。最终，情况可能会变化得如此之大，以至于更新不再是一个好的选择，那将是需要一本全新书籍的信号。**只要我继续得到您的支持，我将一直写下去。**
