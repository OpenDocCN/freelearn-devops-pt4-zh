    1990,[1](#footnote-013) explaining *Psychological Safety was experienced as feeling
    able to show and employ one's self without fear of negative consequences to self-image,
    status, or career.* *Dr Amy Edmondson* provided further explanation in her 1999
    paper,[2](#footnote-012) where she stated, *Psychological safety is a belief that
    one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions,
    concerns, or mistakes.* This was taken from her 1999 paper that got picked up

    Open source software development is built on the pillars of autonomy, mastery,

    discussion forums, and having transparent decision-making records; these practices
    make it easier for people to find purpose, gain expertise, and take ownership

    People across the globe are willingly contributing to open source projects such
    as *OKD* (the community distribution of Kubernetes that powers OpenShift), thus
    improving the product for all. Sometimes they are contributing because it is part
    of their paid work, but quite frequently they contribute because they want to.
    They are working on these projects because of the deep personal fulfillment that
    they gain through helping a community build something better that benefits everyone,
    being self-directed or listened to, and building something for the future; they
    also want to become a better coder by implementing and testing something on a

    enable team members to continuously learn and improve themselves and their team,

    members from connecting with and appreciating business purpose. They should enable
    regular and direct access to business stakeholders, customers, and leadership

  zh: PetBattle — 创造自主性、精通性和目标感
- en: Connecting the engineers to the end users is a great way to create a sense of
    purpose. The PetBattle engineers do not want features or tickets dropped on them
    with no view of how the feature connects to the vision of the product. To combat
    this, they do regular demos with end users and generate some feedback. This connectivity
    allows them to build empathy with one another and see how the application is being
    used in real life.

  zh: 将工程师与最终用户连接起来是创造目标感的一个好方法。PetBattle的工程师不希望功能或任务无缘无故地丢给他们，而且没有看到这些功能如何与产品愿景相连接。为了解决这个问题，他们定期与最终用户进行演示并收集反馈。这种互动让他们能够建立同理心，看到应用在实际生活中的使用方式。
- en: Mary (a self-confessed cat lover who plays PetBattle regularly) was being asked
    to use the app while Ciarán (a member of the PetBattle engineering team) observed
    her. Mary was struggling to understand why her cat was not appearing immediately
    in the competition after she'd uploaded it. Ciarán knew she had to vote for another
    cat before hers would appear in the list, which seemed obvious to him. A few days
    after this feedback, Ciarán sees a ticket in his backlog to have the uploaded
    cat appear in the voting list immediately. Ciarán sees the purpose of this ticket
    immediately and starts thinking about the effect this feature will have on Mary,
    who plays the game regularly.

  zh: 玛丽（一个自认的猫咪爱好者，经常玩PetBattle）在Ciarán（PetBattle工程团队的一员）的观察下使用应用。玛丽正在努力理解为什么她上传的猫咪没有立即出现在比赛中。Ciarán知道她必须先为另一只猫投票，自己的猫才会出现在投票列表中，这对他来说似乎是显而易见的。几天后，Ciarán在他的待办事项中看到一个任务——让上传的猫咪立即出现在投票列表中。Ciarán立刻理解了这个任务的目的，并开始思考这个功能对玛丽（一个经常玩游戏的玩家）产生的影响。
- en: Ciarán and the other engineers working on PetBattle – Aidan, Emma, and Jen –
    recognized that having access to Mary's feedback was really rewarding, especially
    when they had the opportunity to deliver new features to Mary. *It's so much better
    than my previous projects, when I would be asked to code to a specification and
    not really understand what it was that I was helping to build*, said Jen in a
    recent retrospective meeting. Aidan suggested it would be even better if they
    could meet users like Mary every now and again, perhaps working with them to do
    some testing and hear all their other ideas for future development.

  zh: Ciarán和其他参与PetBattle项目的工程师——Aidan、Emma和Jen——意识到，能够获得Mary的反馈是非常有价值的，尤其是在他们有机会向Mary交付新功能时。Jen在最近的一次回顾会议中说：“*这比我之前的项目好多了，在那些项目中，我被要求按照规范编写代码，却并不真正理解自己所帮助构建的是什么*。”Aidan建议，如果他们能时不时地见到像Mary这样的用户，甚至与她们一起做些测试，听听她们对未来发展的其他想法，那就更好了。
- en: During that same retrospective meeting, Aidan called out his personal highlight
    from recent weeks working in the PetBattle engineering team. He said he loved
    how he could just release his new features and bug fixes when he was ready. He
    didn't have to wait for a release window or need a change review board to meet.
    He could just push the button and the awesome technical foundation practices that
    Ciarán and Emma in particular had focused on putting in place meant he could ship
    with confidence. He was learning to create feature toggles around his new code,
    which was even better as it empowered the business product owner to decide when
    to switch on the feature. Aidan thinks the team should look to explore more advanced
    deployment capabilities like this.

- en: Meanwhile, Emma's highlight was having the opportunity to share openly with
    the wider community some of the technical foundation tips she'd picked up. She
    has written several blog articles and has been invited to present at a DevOps
    conference in the new year. She said that, in her previous projects, she wasn't
    allowed to share so openly the work she had done. She felt she had some great
    techniques to share back with the wider technical community. Many folks in this
    community had helped and inspired her own development, so she was very happy to
    share back. Everyone agreed they should seek opportunities to do these kinds of
    things – who knows, maybe it will even help promote and advertise PetBattle as
    a product and, as they grow the team, a really cool place to work!

    a problem is happening, they pull the cord and the whole production line immediately

    original Toyota System Corporation and something called Jidoka. The idea behind
    Jidoka is that by stopping the system, you get an immediate opportunity for improvement,
    or to find the root cause, as opposed to letting the defect move further down
    the line and be left unresolved. The Jidoka concept was pioneered by the original
    Toyota founder, Sakichi Toyoda, also known as the father of the Japanese industrial
    revolution and also the founder of the original Toyota Systems Corporation (before
    they manufactured automobiles).

    Toyoda）开创的，他被称为日本工业革命之父，也是丰田系统公司（在制造汽车之前）的创始人。

    management was saying, *You have saved a customer from receiving a defect.* Whenever

    retrospective is particularly useful because you don't want to learn feedback
    at the end of the week (or even the end of one of the days) if there was a simple
    improvement or resolution that could have been applied much earlier.

    line and represent the *sad* feedback. Does this mean this delivery was going
    really badly? No, not necessarily. When we facilitate real-time retrospectives,
    we actually tell people not to worry about giving us lots of *negative* feedback.
    While it is nice to read the *happy* or *positive* contributions (and it helps
    affirm what we should do more of), it's the improvement ideas that we really want
    to capture. How can we make ourselves better and how can we do that quickly?

    having lunch or breakfast together. This is something we build into our Open Innovation
    Labs residency experience because we see the strength it generates in relationships.
    So, while it may feel a little awkward, we still do it with our virtual teams.
    We have our team members show us around their houses, meet their kids and pets,
    and create fun selfie videos. We have virtual socials – order a pizza and chat
    over a glass of wine, watch a movie online, and even go to a virtual escape room
    activity.

    open and honest communication. Hiding behind a tool or burying a problem does
    not adhere to the principles of transparency. An information refrigerator is exactly

    marbles. To use this, you will need a number of containers to hold enough marbles

    is all about containers, so we've even found a way to get containers to track
    our feelings!) or even just a drawing of a container on large flip-chart paper.

    help unblock and maintain team autonomy and mastery. Where the team is blocked
    and radiating the information to explain why, holding regular *walk the walls*
    sessions with stakeholders and management who can make decisions to unblock and
    change the information can really drive inspection and adaptation for the wider
    good. If there is a problem, if there is a snag, if there is a blocker, make sure
    it is clearly being radiated and have the people who can fix it see that information

    HQ for the next few months. In the room, there were lots of movable desks, portable
    whiteboards, and swivel chairs, as well as bean bags and comfy foam seats. There
    were also some huge foam boards (a couple of inches thick and 8ft by 4ft in size)
    stacked up at one end of the room. All the furniture was pushed over to the other

    worked and how it could be used to *stop the world*. The team seemed very happy

    signs on different parts of the wall. One had now been filled with the social
    contract. There were headings for Impact Map, Event Storm, value slices, product

    great activity to do as a team and was really in the spirit of being empowered.
    The team wheeled in tables and discussed how they'd like to be set up with a mobbing
    corner and pairing stations. They set up every monitor Eoin had purchased. They
    even attached some Raspberry Pi mini-computers to each one. Aidan added a PetBattle
