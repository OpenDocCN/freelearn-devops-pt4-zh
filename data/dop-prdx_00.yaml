  zh: 介绍 – 什么是DevOps悖论？
- en: I love sharing with others. That's my main motivation when I write a book. There's
    a hard-to-explain joy in knowing that our work as authors might be helping others.
    But strangely, that's not the case with *DevOps Paradox*.

  zh: 我喜欢与他人分享。这是我写书时的主要动力。当我意识到作为作者的我们的作品可能在帮助他人时，产生了一种难以言喻的喜悦。但奇怪的是，*DevOps Paradox*（《DevOps悖论》）却不是这样。
- en: This time, my motivation was much more self-serving. I wrote this book because
    I personally wanted to understand what DevOps is. Now if you know anything about
    me, or have read any of my multi-book *DevOps Toolkit* series (https://www.devopstoolkitseries.com),
    then you're surely thinking that I should already know what DevOps is, especially
    if I'm trying to spread my knowledge of it through these books.

  zh: 这次，我的动力更多是自我服务。我写这本书是因为我个人想理解什么是DevOps。如果你了解我，或者读过我多本*DevOps Toolkit*系列书籍（https://www.devopstoolkitseries.com），那么你肯定会想，我应该早就知道什么是DevOps了，尤其是我还通过这些书籍传播有关DevOps的知识。
- en: The thing is, if there's anything that my years of working in the field have
    taught me, it's that DevOps is not a well-defined process. There is no set of
    rules that must be followed. As I discovered in my journey, and as you'll read
    in these pages, it's even questionable whether there is such a thing as a "DevOps
    department" or a "DevOps engineer." This ambiguity is exactly why DevOps is so
    fascinating to me, and I hope to you, the reader, as well.

  zh: 问题是，如果说我的多年的从业经历让我学到什么，那就是DevOps并不是一个明确定义的过程。没有必须遵循的规则。正如我在自己的旅程中发现的那样，正如你在本书中将会看到的那样，甚至可以质疑是否存在“DevOps部门”或“DevOps工程师”这一说法。这种模糊性正是DevOps对我来说如此迷人的原因，我也希望你，读者，也能感受到这一点。
- en: I love going to conferences, but not for the obvious reasons. I rarely listen
    to talks. Instead, I tend to roam the corridors of conference centers and convention
    halls looking for the next victim who will allow me to pick his or her brain.
    The best thing about conferences is networking. The most interesting conversations
    are not taking place at scheduled talks, but rather in corridors and at the after-parties.

- en: Each conversation starts with the question "What is DevOps?" or some variation
    thereof. It is only meant to be a conversation-starter and to facilitate something
    that is an unstructured, unprepared, and very casual conversation. Think of each
    interview as a conversation with a friend or an acquaintance that I've met in

- en: The only thing the people I interviewed have in common is an interest in DevOps
    itself. You'll see, however, that some of them have very opposing views of what
    DevOps actually is (or is not), and even whether it's a worthwhile pursuit. You
    may often feel that what is described by one person contradicts what others have
    said. This is intentional and, in my opinion, reflects the chaos DevOps is trying
    to tame. It also serves as a reminder that we are still in the very early stages
    of adopting DevOps to our workplace cultures, while trying to navigate the complexities
    of the software industry and finding different solutions to the same problems.

  zh: 我采访的人唯一的共同点是对 DevOps 本身的兴趣。然而，你会看到，他们中的一些人对 DevOps 的定义（或否定）截然不同，甚至对其是否值得追求也有不同看法。你可能常常会觉得某个人所描述的内容与其他人所说的相矛盾。这是故意的，在我看来，这反映了
    DevOps 正在试图驯服的混乱。它也提醒我们，我们在将 DevOps 引入工作场所文化的过程中，仍处于非常早期的阶段，同时，我们还在尝试应对软件行业的复杂性，并为相同的问题找到不同的解决方案。
- en: With all that said, I urge you, the reader, to be open-minded. You've almost
    certainly heard about DevOps, and many of you are likely implementing some form
    of DevOps in your organizations right now. I just ask that you leave what you
    know aside. The interviews in this book are likely to turn everything that you
    think you know upside-down. They will definitely challenge your assumptions and
    your experience. What this book won't do, however, is tell you on which side of
    the DevOps debate to pitch your tent. There is no right or wrong answer here.
    This book also won't tell you how to "do" DevOps, though you may glean some ideas
    for implementation from the experiences related in these interviews. My goal with
    this book is solely to present both sides of the DevOps paradox and leave the
    door open for you to make up your own mind.

- en: How ironic that something designed to break down silos within organizations
    and foster cross-departmental collaboration is the subject of so much debate within
    the IT community! But that's the crux of the DevOps paradox, isn't it? And that's
    why it's such a fascinating topic of conversation. You may not agree with everything
    you read in these interviews, but at the very least they should provoke thought
    and maybe even debate within your organizations as you and your teams embark upon
    your own DevOps journeys.
