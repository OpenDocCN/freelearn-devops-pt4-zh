<p>With recent changes, not least the evolution of Microsoft Dynamics NAV into Dynamics 365 Business Central, your development practices need to become more formal. Your success will depend, more than ever before, on your ability to determine the quality of your work more quickly and more consistently. Traditional, that is, manual testing practices will not be sufficient anymore. So, you need to learn automated testing and how to efficiently include this in your daily work. In this book, you will learn how it will enhance your work, functionally and technically, and hopefully learn to love it.</p>

<p>This book is for developers, development managers, testers, functional consultants, and power users working with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central or Dynamics NAV.</p>
<p>The reader is assumed to have a general understanding of Dynamics 365 Business Central as an application and how this application can be extended. Even though some sections will be dedicated to the coding of automated tests, it's not mandatory to be able to write code for Dynamics 365 Business Central. Overall, it sure gives the reader an advantage to be able to think as a tester.</p>

In this chapter, you will make use of standard test libraries and techniques discussed in the previous chapters. The examples in this chapter will teach you the basics of headless and UI testing, and how to handle a positive-negative test.</p>
<p><a href="0f8efb81-438e-48ed-9f7f-bcfa5caa8e92.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a>, <em>From Customer Wish to Test Automation - Next Level</em>, continues the business case from <a href="56634efe-664c-421a-9582-b2a6ae69722a.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>From Customer Wish to Test Automation - The Basics</em>, and introduces some more advanced techniques: how to make use of shared fixtures, how to parameterize tests, and how to handle UI elements and hand over variables to these so-called UI handlers.</p>

<p>This book is an introduction to test automation for Dynamics 365 Business Central. On one hand, various concepts and terminology are discussed, and on the other hand, we will also practice them by coding tests. To get the most out of this book, you might want to <em>practice what is preached</em> by implementing the code examples discussed. As this book, however, does not cover how to program against Business Central, you might first want to read the tips given in <a href="bbbc6672-5043-422a-b54e-a09df933c909.xhtml" target="_blank">Appendix B</a><em>, </em><em>Setting Up VS Code and Using the GitHub project</em>.</p>
<p class="mce-root">If your learning style is to start by finding out the principles, terminology, and concepts, start reading <a href="7b51635c-cd1c-4124-be24-c2597e6d7986.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Introduction to Automated Testing</em>, and move slowly into the more practical <em>Section 3: </em><em>Designing and Building Automated Tests for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central</em>. If your style is more learning by doing, you could dare to take a deep dive into <a href="56634efe-664c-421a-9582-b2a6ae69722a.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>From Customer Wish to Test Automation - The Basics</em>, <a href="0f8efb81-438e-48ed-9f7f-bcfa5caa8e92.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a>, <em>From Customer Wish to Test Automation - Next Level</em>, and <a href="bb9ee41e-4c60-4a27-8fad-5343adfcd86a.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>From Customer Wish to Test Automation - And Some More</em>, straight away, and read the various backgrounds later or while working through the chapters.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>The only step to be taken is to add the following code to the relevant </span><kbd>Initialize</kbd><span> function.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>fields<br/>    {<br/>        field(1; Code; Code[10]){}<br/>        field(2; Description; Text[50]){}<br/>    }</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre><strong>[FEATURE]</strong> LookupValue Customer <strong><br/>[SCENARIO #0001]</strong> Assign lookup value to customer<br/><strong>[GIVEN]</strong> A lookup value<br/><strong>[GIVEN]</strong> A customer</pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> panel.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
