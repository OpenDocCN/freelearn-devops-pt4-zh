- en: With recent changes, not least the evolution of Microsoft Dynamics NAV into
    Dynamics 365 Business Central, your development practices need to become more
    formal. Your success will depend, more than ever before, on your ability to determine
    the quality of your work more quickly and more consistently. Traditional, that
    is, manual testing practices will not be sufficient anymore. So, you need to learn
    automated testing and how to efficiently include this in your daily work. In this
    book, you will learn how it will enhance your work, functionally and technically,
    and hopefully learn to love it.

- en: The reader is assumed to have a general understanding of Dynamics 365 Business
    Central as an application and how this application can be extended. Even though
    some sections will be dedicated to the coding of automated tests, it's not mandatory
    to be able to write code for Dynamics 365 Business Central. Overall, it sure gives
    the reader an advantage to be able to think as a tester.

- en: This book is an introduction to test automation for Dynamics 365 Business Central.
    On one hand, various concepts and terminology are discussed, and on the other
    hand, we will also practice them by coding tests. To get the most out of this
    book, you might want to *practice what is preached* by implementing the code examples
    discussed. As this book, however, does not cover how to program against Business
    Central, you might first want to read the tips given in [Appendix B](bbbc6672-5043-422a-b54e-a09df933c909.xhtml)*, **Setting
    Up VS Code and Using the GitHub project*.

    and concepts, start reading [Chapter 1](7b51635c-cd1c-4124-be24-c2597e6d7986.xhtml),
    *Introduction to Automated Testing*, and move slowly into the more practical *Section
    3: **Designing and Building Automated Tests for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business
    Central*. If your style is more learning by doing, you could dare to take a deep
    dive into [Chapter 5](56634efe-664c-421a-9582-b2a6ae69722a.xhtml), *From Customer
    Wish to Test Automation - The Basics*, [Chapter 6](0f8efb81-438e-48ed-9f7f-bcfa5caa8e92.xhtml),

    the various backgrounds later or while working through the chapters.
