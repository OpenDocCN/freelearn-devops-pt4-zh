- en: More and more companies are making the move to the cloud, and more specifically,
    the **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**) cloud, every day. Once in the cloud, these
    companies and enterprises are looking to streamline their processes and **Software
    Development Life Cycles** (**SDLCs**) through the use of techniques found in DevOps
    practices. This includes automating build and release processes so that development
    teams can focus on writing the code and features that customers desire. This also
    includes making sure that logging and monitoring are in place, not just for the
    sake of checking a checkbox on a deployment list, but instead to empower teams
    to quickly find the root causes of their issues, be they performance, error, or
    security related.

    Passing the AWS DevOps Engineer Professional exam allows you to be separated instantly
    from others, showing that you have taken the time and effort to not only learn
    these valuable skills but also pass the rigorous standard that is the AWS Professional
    certification.

- en: Certifications offered by AWS, especially Professional certification exams,
    are not easy. Those that work and hire in this industry know this. Not only are
    the exams themselves time-consuming at around 3 hours to take, but they are also
    constantly being updated.

- en: There is a lot of information to digest and understand on this exam. You not
    only need to know the topics that are covered in the blueprint provided by AWS,
    but you also need to have a solid foundation of AWS knowledge in order to use
    those services. It helps if you have real-world experience or at least hands-on
    practice with using these services. This is where the exercises that have been
    included in this book come in. They serve not as an ending point but hopefully
    as a starting point to build on and create other projects from so that you have
    the confidence when you press start on your test that you have the skills and
    the knowledge you need to pass the certification test and take your career to
    the next level.

    presented in the AWS DevOps Professional exam. This is accomplished in a variety
    of methods. There are sample architectures presented for many of the services
    so that you can visualize how different services work together. There are plenty
    of hands-on examples to try and therefore see how things work in the real world.
    There are also example cases of best use cases and anti-patterns for the different
    services. These are especially important to understand when evaluating the Professional
    exam questions, which are presented in a large scenario format. Understanding
    where one service is the best fit and where it is not a fit can help you decide
    on the correct answer.

    but also a reference guide in performing your day-to-day activities once you have
    passed. This is where the *beyond* comes in. There is extra information presented
    that is not required for the exam, and this is included on purpose. I wanted to
    share some of the years of experience I have gained from working with all types
    of businesses on AWS, from small and medium-sized companies to large Fortune 100
    enterprises.

    security building blocks of AWS, which are identity and access management using
    the IAM service. After a quick look at the shared security model from AWS and
    the concepts of authorization versus authentication, we review creating users
    and groups. Providing access to other accounts via cross-account access is also
    covered in this chapter with a practical exercise. In this fundamental security
    chapter, we also talk about other essential security services that may appear
    in test questions, such as AWS Directory Service, Secrets Manager, and Systems
    Manager Parameter Store. There are comparisons on when to use and not to use the
    different versions of AWS Directory Service, along with which service would be
    better to store your secrets. Finally, we take a look at Amazon Cognito and how
    it can help with application authentication.'

    templates, but then we''ll quickly ramp up to examples of creating a changeset
    for a basic template, and then move on to intrinsic functions and nested stacks.
    Using the knowledge of CloudFormation templates, we discuss how ServiceCatalog
    can be used to serve up templated designs for developers and non-developers in

    is a developer, with a whole new set of permissions that are scoped to just this
    user''s role. After creating an initial CodeCommit repository, we have our developer
    use Git to commit code onto a feature branch and then request a merge to the main

    that we have been talking about and practicing previously come into play. The
    pipeline example being used is crafted in a CloudFormation template. The developer
    user that we previously created also needs expanded access in order to view and

    the AWS Config service, you can keep a constant check on what is being created
    in your AWS environment. Combine this with rules that flag violations for what
    is not allowed in your environment to either send alerts or do automated enforcement
    and remediation. Add to this the capabilities of System Manager, which can automatically
    install software on instances using runbooks for needed compliance items such
