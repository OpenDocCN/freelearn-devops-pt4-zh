- en: Logs are a river of information, and they flow from various sources. The logs
    that come from the Load Balancer can be a valuable source of data or a resource
    for troubleshooting. Knowing how to enable these resources can be vital when setting
    up or running your environment. Any action taken in the AWS environment, either
    via the AWS Management Console, the CLI, or an SDK, is recorded via the underlying
    API call to CloudTrail. As a DevOps engineer, it's essential to know who and what
    is making changes to your environment and be able to retrieve that data, especially
    when requested.

    encrypts the files, which it stores in Amazon S3 with **S3 server-side encryption**

    service and encrypt the CloudTrail logs with that key.

- en: The CloudTrail service offers several benefits. The first is that it records
    user and resource activity. Using these recordings, you can identify who did what
    and when they performed an action on a resource in your AWS account. Secondly,
    since event logs are automatically stored and recorded, compliance reporting becomes
    much more manageable. Third, you gain the ability to monitor, alarm, and react
    to the events that are happening by sending the CloudTrail events to CloudWatch
    Logs. The fourth and final benefit that we will mention here is the ability to
    search through the logs using the CloudWatch service using a SQL-like syntax.
    This enables you to perform powerful queries on the large amounts of data that
    CloudTrail produces.

  zh: CloudTrail 服务提供了几个好处。第一个是它记录了用户和资源的活动。通过这些记录，你可以识别是谁在什么时间对 AWS 账户中的资源执行了什么操作。其次，由于事件日志会自动存储和记录，合规性报告变得更加易于管理。第三，你能够通过将
    CloudTrail 事件发送到 CloudWatch Logs 来监控、警报和响应正在发生的事件。第四个也是我们在这里提到的最后一个好处是，通过使用类似
    SQL 的语法，你可以利用 CloudWatch 服务搜索日志。这使你能够对 CloudTrail 产生的大量数据执行强大的查询。
