    exam that span the realm of policy and standards. Each of these services has a
    specific role to play in the AWS ecosystem, and knowing their use case as well
    as where they are a good fit can help solve problems for a particular organization.

    Security Hub.

    view. Security Hub collects the data from the different accounts that you manage,
    along with the different services being run inside of those accounts. AWS Security
    Hub also supports third-party integrations from partners such as Cloud Custodian,
    Check Point, IBM''s QRadar, CrowdStrike Falcon, and others. The full list of partner
    integrations can be found here: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-partner-providers.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-partner-providers.html).'

    the findings from other AWS security services, such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon
    Inspector, and Amazon Macie. Using Security Hub also allows account holders to
    prioritize the findings that are discovered for an account so that the most vulnerable
    items may be addressed first.

    of events are only possible after you have started the Security Hub service. Any
    events that have occurred prior to starting the service are not collected, and
    hence findings are not generated for those events.

    exposed from the standpoint that users have either not gone through the proper

- en: You have just joined a company that is in the midst of moving a large number
    of workloads out of their current data center into the AWS cloud. Their current
    workloads in their data center are running on VMware vSphere. These workloads
    on-premises are a combination of Windows Server, Red Hat Linux, and Ubuntu Server,
    which need to be moved to AWS. With 400–500 servers and a tight deadline, the
    company does not want to have to install an agent on each virtual machine. They
    would also prefer to be able to test the migration incrementally during the process.
    Which tool would help you accomplish all of the company's objectives?
