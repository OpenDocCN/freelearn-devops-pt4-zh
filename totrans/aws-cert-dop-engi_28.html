			<h1 id="_idParaDest-489"><a id="_idTextAnchor501"/>Chapter 23: Overview of the DevOps Professional Certification Test</h1>
			<p>Hopefully, by the time you reach this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the vast amount of material we have covered up to this point, all of which may appear on the <strong class="bold">DevOps Professional Certification test</strong>. Once you feel ready to take the test, you must register for the exam and will receive a specified exam time. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The DOP-CO1 exam guide</li>
				<li>How the exam is scored</li>
				<li>Understanding the different testing options</li>
				<li>Study tips for preparing for the exam</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-490"><a id="_idTextAnchor502"/>The DOP-C01 exam guide  </h1>
			<p>Each AWS certification <a id="_idIndexMarker1755"/>that is currently offered publishes an exam guide. This is the blueprint for success in passing the exam. It explains the expected experience and requirements a testing candidate should have before taking the exam. It also outlines what topics (or domains) will be covered in the exam. If you would like to look at the current exam guide, it is available at the following URL: <a href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-devops-pro/AWS-Certified-DevOps-Engineer-Professional_Exam-Guide.pdf">https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-devops-pro/AWS-Certified-DevOps-Engineer-Professional_Exam-Guide.pdf</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-491"><a id="_idTextAnchor503"/>The exam requirements as per the exam guide </h2>
			<p>It is recommended <a id="_idIndexMarker1756"/>that you have 2 or more years of experience using the AWS platform to provision, operate, and manage AWS environments before taking the DevOps Professional Certification exam. You should also have experience automating infrastructures and constructing systems using Infrastructure as Code (preferably with CloudFormation templates). You need to have proficiency in administrating modern operating systems such as Windows and Linux. Finally, it is recommended that you have a solid understanding of the modern development and operations processes, as well as the methodologies that make up these processes.  </p>
			<p>AWS will also explain what is not in scope for the test. This is helpful as the certification team is telling you what you do not need to concentrate on with your studies. The following topics are outside the scope of the exam:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Advanced networking (advanced routing algorithms, failover techniques) </li>
				<li>Deep-level security recommendations for developers </li>
				<li>Database query and performance optimization </li>
				<li>Full stack application code development </li>
				<li>Normalization of data schemes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we <a id="_idIndexMarker1757"/>understand what AWS expects from us, as candidates, as far as requirements go, let's take a look at how the exam is scored. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-492"><a id="_idTextAnchor504"/>How the exam is scored </h1>
			<p>AWS certification<a id="_idIndexMarker1758"/> exams are broken down into domains. Although the domains have different scoring levels, it is important to have a mastery of all domains since missing just one or two questions can mean the difference in passing or failing the<a id="_idIndexMarker1759"/> exam. There are two types of questions that are presented in the exam:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Multiple choice questions</strong>: These questions have one correct response. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Multiple selection questions</strong>: These questions have two or more correct responses. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>For multiple selection questions, no partial credit is given. You must select all of the correct answers to gain the points for that question. Also, unanswered questions are counted as incorrect answers. This means you are better off guessing at an answer than leaving it blank. </p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 23.1 – The six domains on the DevOps Professional Certification exam</p>
			<p>The exam itself is 180 minutes or 3 hours in length, with 80 questions in total. This leaves you a<a id="_idIndexMarker1760"/> little over 2 minutes to read, comprehend, and answer <a id="_idIndexMarker1761"/>each question. Let's examine each of the six domains in more detail:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Domain 1: SDLC Automation – 22%</strong>: The questions in this section of the exam concentrate on CI/CD pipelines, source control, testing, and artifact storage/management. These questions can test your knowledge on how to set up and configure code repositories, along with automating deployment pipelines that have multiple stages. You also need to have an understanding of the workflow for accommodating changes or new commits into a repository, along with<a id="_idIndexMarker1762"/> incorporating secure practices and requirements with your <strong class="bold">code versioning system</strong> (<strong class="bold">CVS</strong>). <p>In domain 1, you will also be tested on your ability to add and run integrated testing in your code process. This includes allowing a process to either pass or fail based on the test results. Once your code has passed, you need to be able to create and store artifacts in a secure manner. You also need to have the capability to determine the correct delivery strategy, such as Blue/Green, Canary, or AB for a particular business based on the needs expressed. </p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Domain 2: Configuration Management and Infrastructure as Code – 19%</strong>: In domain 2, you are tested on your ability to determine the deployment of different services based on the deployment's needs and requirements. You also need to understand how to use life cycle hooks for both optimizing starting up and shutting down instances. Also present in this domain is the need to identify the pros and cons for different configuration management tools, along with demonstrating the ability to run configuration management in an automated fashion. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Domain 3: Monitoring and Logging – 15%</strong>: This domain concentrates on storing, aggregating, and analyzing logs and monitoring your systems. This includes distributed log collection and processing using different agents such as the CloudWatch agent, <strong class="source-inline">flumd</strong>, or others. You will also need to understand how to manage log storage, such as transitioning logs from CloudWatch to S3, using S3 life cycles to phase out older logs, and even S3 events to trigger event-driven actions. Also<a id="_idIndexMarker1763"/> included in this domain is the process of creating custom CloudWatch metrics and log subscription filters. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Domain 4: Policies and Standards Automation – 10%</strong>: Cost optimization through the process of automating manual processes is one of the main themes of domain 4. The other main theme of domain 4 is the ability to implement governance strategies. This includes the ability to enforce compliance using self-service products such as Service Catalog and report on the compliance of an organization. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Domain 5: Incident and Event Response – 18%</strong>: In this domain, you need to be able to help troubleshoot an issue and determine its root cause as quickly as possible. This also includes setting up and configuring alerts and event-driven actions from those alerts. You are expected to understand how to use the <strong class="source-inline">Route53</strong> service to direct traffic to another region in case of regional failure.  </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Domain 6: High Availability, Fault Tolerance, and Disaster Recover – 16%</strong>: This final domain will assess your ability to determine whether you need to deploy to multiple regions or multiple availability zones. You also need to evaluate the correct services needed for the organization's RTO and RPO requirements. You will also need to be able to evaluate a deployment for points of failure. <p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">There are 10 questions in the exam that do not affect your score. You will not know which questions these are. These questions are used to collect performance metrics for use in future <a id="_idIndexMarker1764"/>exams. </p></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-493"><a id="_idTextAnchor505"/>Obtaining a passing score </h2>
			<p>The DevOps<a id="_idIndexMarker1765"/> Professional Certification exam is a pass or fail exam. Once you press the final submission button, then your test will be scored, and you will be notified if you have passed or failed. The test is graded on a scoring scale of 1,000, and you need at least a score of 750 to pass the exam. The math breaks down to this: with 70 valid questions (remember, 10 questions do not affect your score), you need to correctly answer 53 questions in the exam to pass. This is not the full scoring system since some domains are more prevalent than others. Or, if you think of it the other way around, you can only miss 17 questions throughout the entire exam.  </p>
			<p>AWS will later email you a detailed report of how you scored on each of the six domains. This breakdown will also be available in your <strong class="bold">Certmetrics</strong> account, under the previous exams section. </p>
			<p>Now that we know what it takes to pass the exam, let's briefly discuss your options if you do not pass on your first attempt. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-494"><a id="_idTextAnchor506"/>If you do not pass the exam on your first attempt</h2>
			<p>If you have<a id="_idIndexMarker1766"/> seen that dreaded fail word after you have submitted your exam, do not fret. All is not lost. There is a mandatory 14-day waiting period between attempts, and you will need to pay the necessary fee to retake the exam. There is no longer a limit on the number of times a candidate can attempt the exam. </p>
			<p>One of the key things to do is have a piece of paper nearby, either in your vehicle if you are taking the test on location at an actual exam site, or find one after your exam is over if you have chosen the online proctoring route. Write down some of the topics that you feel you were not strongly prepared for. This is an immediate opportunity to capture information regarding what you did not feel you were prepared for while it is still fresh in your mind. If you do not take this immediate step, you may regret it later when you go back to think about areas that you need to concentrate on.  </p>
			<p>Commit to retaking the test in a short timeframe after restudying the material. This is key. It does not have to be directly after the mandatory 14-day waiting period, but it should not be more than 60 days later. You have already put in the time and effort to study for the initial exam and now have a better understanding of what the actual questions will be like. At this point, you will have received the results back from AWS, showing how you scored on each of the six domains, showing you where your strengths and weakness are in the testing process. Don't make the mistake of failing to review the topics where<a id="_idIndexMarker1767"/> you scored higher than others. The certification exams contain a large bank of questions, and it is rare to see the same question multiple times in a row. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-495"><a id="_idTextAnchor507"/>Understanding the different testing options </h1>
			<p>AWS has <a id="_idIndexMarker1768"/>begun to offer multiple choices for taking the exam. Not only do you have the option of taking the exam at a testing center, but there is also the option of having an online proctored exam right from the comfort of your own home, without the need to go anywhere. Let's examine both options as there are some pros and cons to each.  </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-496"><a id="_idTextAnchor508"/>Registering to take the exam </h2>
			<p>When you<a id="_idIndexMarker1769"/> feel like you have a solid understanding of the material that will be presented in the exam, then it's time to register for a time slot to take the test. To register, you will need to go to the <a href="https://aws.training">https://aws.training</a> site and either sign in if you already have an account or create a new account. </p>

			<p>It is a good practice to schedule your exam about 2 weeks out from when you feel that you will be able to take the exam. Using this technique will allow you to push away any final distractions around you, knowing that you have a hard deadline that you have to meet. If you <a id="_idIndexMarker1770"/>continue to wait until you feel completely confident in scheduling your exam, then this can lead to hesitancy in scheduling. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">If you are a non-native English speaker, then you are allowed an additional 30 minutes for your test. However, before scheduling your exam, you must request this accommodation via the certmetrics.com portion of the AWS training site. This can be found once you click on the <strong class="bold">Upcoming Exams</strong> top menu item. From here, you can <strong class="bold">Request Exam Accommodations</strong>.</p>

			<p>If you cannot make the exam on the date that you set, you can cancel up to 24 hours in advance without any penalties. If you skip your exam date without canceling within this advanced window, then you will forfeit the cost of the exam, but it will not count as a failed exam. </p>
			<p>Now that we have covered the basics of taking the exam, let's look at some of the differences<a id="_idIndexMarker1771"/> between taking the exam at the testing center and a remote location using online proctoring. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-497"><a id="_idTextAnchor509"/>Taking the test at a testing center </h2>
			<p>Testing <a id="_idIndexMarker1772"/>centers, which allow the certification exams to be taken on site, are operated by either PSI or Pearson VUE. You can search for local testing centers around you and then see what time slots are available to take the tests. Sometimes, you need to schedule a week or more in advance, so as you get closer to being ready to take the test, start looking at the availability in your area and how long in advance you will need to book your test. </p>
			<p>After scheduling the date and time for your exam, you will need to arrive at the testing center a few minutes before your scheduled time so that you can check in and be seated. It is a good idea to either have a print-out of the email sent by AWS, which will specify your test confirmation number, or to have the email available on your smartphone, just in case there are any issues locating your name and test in the system. When checking in, you will need to provide two forms of ID, one of which will need to be a government-issued ID card and one of which can be something such as a school ID or credit card. </p>
			<p>Before stepping into the exam area, you will be asked to empty your pockets, remove any extra jackets, cellphone, hats, sunglasses, pens, or other items as they are not allowed in the testing room. The testing facility will provide a locker and a lock for you to store your items while you are taking the exam. They will provide you with a pencil and 2-3 sheets of blank scratch paper. You will need to return all of the scratch paper when you are finished with the exam. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-498"><a id="_idTextAnchor510"/>Taking the test via online proctoring </h2>
			<p>If there is not <a id="_idIndexMarker1773"/>a Pearson VUE or PSI center available for taking the test around you or you feel like you would be more comfortable in your surroundings, then you have the option to take the test via the online proctoring method using one of your computers. </p>
			<p>If you choose this method, then you will need to install the OnVUE software onto your computer so that the remote person proctoring your exam can keep an eye on your system while you are taking the exam. This is best done a few days (and at a minimum, a few hours) before your exam's start time to ensure that the computer that you are planning to use meets all of the requirements and that the OnVUE software can perform its system test.  </p>
			<p>The space in which you will be taking the test will also need to be not only neat but also clean. This means removing all notes, pieces of paper, and other items from the area where you are going to be taking the exam. No food or smoking is allowed in the area where you are going to be taking the exam either, but the Pearson VUE site does say that a beverage in any container is allowed. If you have a multi-monitor setup on your desk, then those extra monitors will need to be unplugged for the duration of the exam. The same goes for any extra computers or smart devices that are in the immediate area. </p>
			<p>30 minutes before your scheduled exam time, you will need to use a link provided to you to take pictures of the area that you will be using for the exam to verify that it is a clean environment. You will also need to send a picture of a government-issued ID to ensure that the person on the webcam is you taking the exam. </p>
			<p>You cannot<a id="_idIndexMarker1774"/> use your mobile phone once you have started the exam process. Doing so will get your exam revoked. This also goes for leaving the view of the webcam. When the exam starts, the proctor will be listening for any variations in noise in your environment. This includes reading the questions aloud to yourself or even mumbling, trying to get a better understanding of the question. If they do catch you making noises, then you will get a warning; multiple warnings may lead to your exam being revoked. </p>
			<p>Some of these last points are one of two major differences between taking the exam in a testing center and taking the exam via an online proctor. One of the other major differences is that at the online testing center, you are given 2-3 sheets of real paper and a pencil to write notes during your exam. This is in strict contrast to the virtual whiteboard that you have to use with your mouse or trackpad. </p>
			<p>There is one other option that is usually not spoken of when taking the certification exams, and that is taking the certification exam at the AWS re:Invent conference. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-499"><a id="_idTextAnchor511"/>Taking a certification test at re:Invent – a cautionary tale</h2>
			<p>If you ever <a id="_idIndexMarker1775"/>have the opportunity to go to the re:Invent conference, then I suggest that you go at least once for the experience. When you get there, there is an even greater push than from the early days to get you certified and gain access to the certification lounge. Taking the certification test in this type of environment is unlike any other. There are rows of computer screens and people packed side by side in a large conference room, staring quietly at the various tests they are trying to take. As you are trying to concentrate on your exam, you cannot help but see the various other people finishing and getting up and sitting down repeatedly. It becomes distracting, and sometimes, thoughts will wander in your head about if they are taking the same exam as you and, if so, how are they finishing so quickly. </p>
			<p>One of the things that you may not think about when signing up for a test at the re:Invent conference is that there are a lot of extra-curricular activities going on, especially at night, many times with one or more adult beverages. This can draw you away from the quiet time that you need to do the final preparations for your exam. It can also lead to leaving you feeling not as fresh as you need to be if you have scheduled your exam for the morning. </p>
			<p>Given that we have gone over the different options available for taking the actual certification test, let's focus on study tips for the exam to optimize your chances for success. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-500"><a id="_idTextAnchor512"/>Study tips for preparing for the exam</h1>
			<p>Although we <a id="_idIndexMarker1776"/>have covered a lot of material throughout this book, passing the certification exam takes study and discipline. After taking and both passing and failing multiple AWS exams, some tips can be passed on to help you try and have the best chance of success. </p>
			<p>One of the first things to note about the exam is that it is an exercise in reading and comprehension as much as it is on AWS services and knowledge. Skimming through the questions and answers can lead to missing a critical piece of information and therefore missing the question altogether. Even though you only have around 2 and a half minutes to read, comprehend, and answer each of the questions, each of those questions must be carefully read for the correct details and components. Practicing reading the large question format is an important key to success, I have found. The ability to focus on this long format exam can help, especially when you look up at the timer and see that the minutes are <a id="_idIndexMarker1777"/>running down and there are still several questions that you need to answer. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-501"><a id="_idTextAnchor513"/>AWS whitepapers to read</h2>
			<p>Many of the<a id="_idIndexMarker1778"/> questions in the exam are based on the whitepapers that have been written through the years at AWS. I would strongly suggest reading these whitepapers to gain a better understanding of the topics presented in this book. Some should just help to reinforce the content that was used to craft this chapter and its hands-on exercises. Others will go deeper into some of the topics that will be covered in the exam. There are also a few questions that will be derived directly from the whitepaper's context: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Infrastructure as Code</strong>: https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/DevOps/infrastructure-as-code.pdf</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Introduction to DevOps on AWS</strong>: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/introduction-devops-aws/introduction-devops-aws.pdf</li>

				<li><strong class="bold">Infrastructure Event Readiness</strong>: https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-infrastructure-event-readiness.pdf</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Operational Excellence Pillar (AWS Well Architected Framework)</strong>: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-excellence-pillar/wellarchitected-operational-excellence-pillar.pdf">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-excellence-pillar/wellarchitected-operational-excellence-pillar.pdf</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>While this seems like a large amount of extra reading, it needs to be emphasized once again that many of the questions come from the whitepapers. Gaining the necessary knowledge<a id="_idIndexMarker1779"/> and having an understanding of its context will help you feel more comfortable while reading through the complex questions presented in the exam. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-502"><a id="_idTextAnchor514"/>Final test tips</h2>
			<p>The test itself<a id="_idIndexMarker1780"/> is long. It is 3 hours in length. Especially if you are taking the test in the morning, I suggest that you do not fill up on coffee. Remember that, if you are doing an online proctoring session, you are not allowed to leave the view of the webcam. Before you start the test, it's a good idea to head nature's call so that you can concentrate fully on the exam. </p>
			<p>Don't second guess yourself too much by marking lots of questions to review. Most of the time, your initial choice will be your best choice. I have had some handwringing instances in the past with taking certification tests where I marked 5-7 questions for review and changed my initial answer on at least four questions only to fail the test by 1-2 questions when the scoring finally came out. Did I miss the questions where I changed the answer at the end of the test? I cannot say definitively since AWS does not give you feedback on those types of metrics, but I have since changed the way that I use the review button. If I am having a hard time understanding the question and/or the answers, I will select something and then go on to the next question. </p>
			<p>Even though they have taken out the lower associate test prerequisite before you take the professional level exam, I would not suggest just jumping right to the professional-level test. Sitting the exam for either the AWS SysOps Associate or the Developer Associate certification, which was once part of the necessary prerequisites to taking the DevOps professional exam, gives you a proper warmup to taking the professional-level exam. Even in my recertification, I usually take the lower test so that I can judge what new services and questions they have added to the exam in a simpler format, before going after the <a id="_idIndexMarker1781"/>professional-level recertification a few weeks later.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 23.4 – Example of the brain dump format</p>
			<p>I recommend going to the testing center to take the test. One of the main reasons for this is for the actual pieces of paper that you get. The night before taking the exam, practice with a blank sheet of paper and write some quick notes on the main heading topics that can just jog your memory, as shown in the preceding figure. I would practice this about 3-5 times the night before the test so that I could do this in less than 5 minutes once I was seated at my terminal at the testing center, as I was typing in my username and testing ID, but before I would press the start button. I used to teach this technique in the AWS meetup group I ran for 6 years, where many of the members used to challenge each other on accomplishing multiple levels of AWS certifications. You can't bring any type of cheat sheet into the testing center. You are only quickly dumping out information from your brain onto the scratch piece of paper provided and then handing that piece of paper back to the testing center once you are finished with the test. You can refer to these quick notes as the test is taking place; however, since you created them, it allows you to take a breath and relax while concentrating on reading and comprehending the questions. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-503"><a id="_idTextAnchor515"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Becoming a certified (or even recertified) AWS professional is a task that takes dedication, study, as well as the ability to successfully pass a strenuous testing format. Believe that your hard work and studying will pay off. The AWS DevOps Professional Certification is a badge of honor that is recognized by colleges and employers alike. </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will present you with a mock exam so that you can both test your knowledge and continue to become familiar with the question-and-answer format that is shown on the professional exam. </p>
