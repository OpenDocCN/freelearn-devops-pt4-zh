- en: DevOps has become a real buzzword in recent years. DevOps is a combination of
    cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization's ability
    to deliver applications and services at high speed and with high quality. Azure
    DevOps is a **Software as a Service** (**SaaS**) platform from Microsoft that
    provides an end-to-end set of tools for developing and deploying software by applying
    DevOps techniques. This book starts with an overview of the Azure DevOps platform
    before diving into various tools and features, such as boards for project management,
    repos for source control management, build and release pipelines, test plans,
    artifacts, and more.
