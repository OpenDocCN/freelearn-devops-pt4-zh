    Azure DevOps. Then, we will create a new organization in Azure DevOps. We imported
    a sample project and organization called Tailwind Traders in the previous chapter.
    We will use this example for the rest of this chapter. We will use this Tailwind
    Traders project to create a new project and learn how to create and manage the
    different project activities using Azure Boards.

    name. In our Tailwind Traders project, the Agile project template is being used.
    This changes the name to **Iterations**. However, Azure DevOps treats these the
    same as **Sprints**.
  prefs: []

- en: Iterations or **Sprints** are used to divide the work into a specific number
    of (mostly) weeks. This is based on the velocity that a team can handle; that
    is, the rate at which the team is burning the User Stories.

    dragged to different lanes according to the progress that has been made by the
    team. The team also briefly discusses these items and asks for help with executing
    or creating them when needed. At the end of the sprint, most of the items will
    be moved to the **Closed** column.

    DevOps. This way, you can easily get an overview of all the Work Items that are
    in a particular type, state, or have a particular label. This can be done within
    a project, but also across different projects.

    at the different project templates that you can choose from based on the methodology
    that your organization embraces. Based on that project template, different Work
    Items are created that can be used for planning the project. These Work Items
    can be added to backlogs and relationships can be created for a logical view of
    the project items. They can also be added to sprints.
