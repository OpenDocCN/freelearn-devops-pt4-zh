- en: '**Continuous Delivery** (**CD**) and DevOps have been in the spotlight over
    the last decade or so. Much has been written about the technical aspects and tooling
    of CD and DevOps, yet a vast number of so-called IT experts don''t really understand
    what they actually are. More worryingly, they don''t seem to know what they are
    definitely not. Over the pages that make up this book I will be unpicking both
    CD and DevOps so that you will gain an understanding of what they are, how they
    came to be, and how they can bring true business value to your business. Strictly
    speaking, we should consider CD and DevOps as two complementary yet separate approaches:'

- en: Continuous Delivery, as the name suggests, is a way of working whereby quality
    products, normally software assets, can be built, tested and shipped in quick
    successionâ€”thus delivering value much sooner than traditional approaches.

    collaboratively, and in harmony towards a common goal with little or no organizational
    barriers or boundaries between them.

    you optimize, streamline, and improve the way you work and, ultimately, how you
    ship quality software. Included in this book are some tricks and tips based on
    real-world experiences and observations; they can help you reduce the time and
    effort needed to implement and adopt CD and DevOps, which, in turn, can help you
    reduce the time and effort required to consistently ship quality software.

    C-level executives, product owners, developers, testers, project managers, or
    the ever inquisitive tech press, perceive a common problem at some point; delivering
    quality software can be very hard, very painful, and very expensive. It needn't
    be and it shouldn't be. This book has been written for everyone and anyone who
    wants to understand how to overcome these hardships and how CD and DevOps adoption
