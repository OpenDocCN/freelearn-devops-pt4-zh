- en: As described in the preface, **Continuous Delivery** (**CD**) and DevOps are
    complementary ways of working. The former gives anyone who delivers customer value
    via software the ability to do so rapidly, consistently, and—as the name implies—continuously.
    The latter helps harmonize the teams that deliver and support said software. Both
    approaches can help you to optimize, streamline, and improve the way you work,
    and ultimately how you deliver value by shipping quality software.

    blurred over the past decade—be that by tech press misunderstanding or recruitment
    businesses wanting to add 10% on salary rates, or software vendors and consultancies

- en: One thing you need to take into account is that almost all successful software
    businesses go through a number of phases of evolution. They normally start life
    as a small highly-focused team with good ideas, plenty of ambition, and some investment.
    As they build their market share, reach, and revenue, a period of rapid growth
    normally follows both in terms of workforce and spend. As the business matures
    and becomes established, they transition to the next phase of either continued
    and substantial growth to keep ahead of the competition, or make themselves a
    target for acquisition—this usually depends on how quickly investors want to see
    a return.

    business processes will become more complex, which in turn leads to complexity
    and pain in terms of how software is delivered.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The adoption of CD and DevOps can assist in reducing this complexity and pain;
    however, the effectiveness and benefits a business can reap are very much dependent
    on where the business sits on the evolutionary scale. If you are off the mark,
    then adoption can be more trouble than it is worth, and you may end up making
    things worse for the overall business. Not only that, but business, are strange
    and unique creatures—especially those whose raison d'etre is delivering software
    solutions—and no two are the same; therefore, the adoption needs to be uniquely
    tailored to fit.

    a relatively small amount of cash so it needed to move fast to be able to survive
    and it needed to quickly entice, enlist, and retain customers at all costs. It
    did this by delivering what the customer wants just before the customer needs
    it. Deliver too soon, and it may have wasted money on building solutions that
    the customer decides they no longer want. Deliver too late, and someone else may
    well have taken the company''s market share—and the revenue—away. The keyword

    new technologies, tools, and R&D. The drier side of business—administration, program

    processes to enable the speedy delivery of quality software. Agile is adopted
    across the R&D team, and the opportunity to fully exploit engineering best practices
    is realized. The original ACME platform starts to creak and is showing its age,
    so further investment is provided to re-architect and rewrite the software platform
    using the latest architectural approaches and technologies. In short, the R&D

    when trying to bring these changes on board whilst a business is going through
    organizational changes and/or growth. In the ACME example, too much was changing

    solutions. The intention was to automate as many parts of the broken process as
    possible to reduce the pain. They also applied energies evangelizing within their
    technically-focused peer groups. Although their ideas and suggestions were welcomed
    by the majority, there was not the appetite to adopt these new-fangled tools—everyone
    was far too busy trying to ship software within the broken process. They needed

    agreed to help them to obtain budget to form a small team focusing on advancing
    the CD and DevOps tooling. The newly-formed team's members spent a few months
    identifying and breaking down the immediate and most painful issues, and built,
    installed, and implemented tooling to remove some of the pain—to ease the adoption,
    many of the tools are bespoke to fit into the existing processes.

    to speak—and used without extensive modification. The team's members have to drastically
    change their direction, become less technology-focused, and act more like agents
    for business change. They then highlighted this now-obvious fact to as many people
    as they can up and down the organization while the influential manager worked
    to obtain backing from the senior leadership to implement far-reaching business
    change. Luckily, their reputation and standing within the organization was such

    focus, patience, and, above all, time to produce quantifiable, positive results,
    however after some months, the vision and benefits start to be realized. Now the
    process of building and delivering software has transformed to the extent that
    a code change can be built, fully tested, and deployed to the production platform
    in minutes many times per day—all at the press of a button and initiated and monitored
    by the developer who made the change, all with no downtime and little/no impact
    on the customers. The stakeholders have a trusted and reliable way of delivering
    value to their customers, the R&D team has the tooling and empowerment to deliver
    value as and when it is needed, and the Ops team has a stable and reliable platform
    that it can support and optimize.

    and leaner but their story doesn't end there. As with any successful business,
    they don't rest on their laurels but decide to expand into new markets and opportunities—namely,
    to build and deliver mobile-optimized clients to work with and complement their
    core web-based propositions.

    optimal way of working to allow them to deliver quality products that customers
    want, when they want them, and they know how to deliver quickly, reliably, and
    incrementally. However, the complexities of delivering features to a hosted web-based
    platform are not the same as the complexities of delivering features to an end
    consumer's mobile device—they are comparable but not the same. For example, the
    process of delivering code to production servers many times per day is under the
    control of the ACME team, whereas they have little or no control over how their
    mobile clients are delivered to end customers, nor if and when the end customer
    will install the latest and greatest version from the various app stores onto
    which the mobile client is published. In addition to this, the production platform
    onto which the mobile client will be installed is pretty much an unknown in terms
    of spec, performance, and storage.

    learned a vast amount throughout their evolutionary journey, and decide to approach
    this new challenge as they had done previously. They know they can build, test,
    and deliver software with consistent quality. They know how to deliver change
    incrementally with little or no impact. They know how to support customers and
    monitor and react quickly to change. They know their culture is mature and that
    the wider organization can work as one to overcome shared challenges.

    newly rekindled success: the amount of traffic and transactions start to grow
    very quickly. They therefore need to scale out their platform and they need to
    do it as soon as possible. Rather than rely on their own datacenters, they decide
    to move their entire platform to a globally-distributed cloud-based solution.
    This brings with it new challenges: the infrastructure is completely different,
    the provisioning tools are new, the tools used to build and deliver software are
    incompatible with the existing ACME tools. Again, the ACME systems team take this
    in stride and forge ahead with confidence using the highly collaborative ways
    of working, techniques, and approaches that are now part of their DNA.'

    that ACME systems Version 2.0 business would have had major struggles, and by
    the time the products had hit the market, they would have been out of date and
    fighting for market share with the quicker and leaner competition.

    has little to do with technical tools and everything to do with how people work
    together. Without the changes to the culture and behaviors of everyone involved
    in the end-to-end delivery process, it is almost impossible to realize and maximize
    the benefits that a successful adoption of CD and DevOps brings. It could be said
    that if they knew this simple, yet mostly overlooked, fact from day one, then
    the adoption would have happened sooner and the business would have been far stronger
    far sooner. Hopefully, this will provide some food for thought for you as you
    move through the rest of the book.

    CD and DevOps is very much dependent on where a business sits on the evolutionary
    scale. We've been through ACME's evolution and the phases it went through. Please
    take into account that ACME is fictional and its story is pretty simplistic. A
    real-world business is not simple—far from it—and it is pretty difficult to ascertain
    where a given business sits on the CD and DevOps evolutionary scale. Without this
    information, it's hard to understand how receptive, responsive, and open to adoption
    a business actually is.
