                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In <a href="4ca6da75-a952-4ea8-9137-19cbc1d21012.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>The Evolution of Software Delivery</em>, <span>you were introduced to ACME systems and given an insight into how it realized that there were problems with its software delivery process (severely impacting its ability to meet the expectations of its customers and deliver value to them), how it identified and addressed these problems, evolved, and after some hard work, determination, and time, adopted CD and DevOps ways of working to overcome them.</span></p>
<p>The story based upon a fictional business is pretty simplistic and linear to make it easier for you the reader to follow. Real life is never that simple, but there are a number of key points that were raised during the storytelling that do apply to real-life businesses. The most important of these for any business considering—or actively pursuing—the adoption of CD and/or DevOps is that there has to be a reason for said adoption. CD and DevOps, like any solution, can help you solve a problem—or set of problems—but you need to truly understand and quantify the problem(s) beforehand; otherwise, you'll never know for sure whether the solution has helped.</p>
<p>Just as ACME systems did, you need to take the time and make the effort to, as the well-used agile term states, inspect before you can adapt.</p>
<p>Your first reaction to this may be that you don't have any problems and that everything is working well and everyone involved with your software delivery process is highly effective, engaged, and motivated. If that is indeed true, then one of the following has happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have achieved software delivery utopia and as such don't need to read any further beyond this point</li>
<li>You are in denial</li>
<li>You do not fully understand how efficient and streamlined software delivery can (should) actually be</li>
</ul>
<p>It's more likely that you have a workable process for delivering software but there are certain areas within the overall process—maybe certain teams or individuals—that slow things down. This is most probably not intentional; maybe there are certain rules and regulations that need to be adhered to, maybe there are certain quality gates that are needed, maybe no one has ever questioned why certain things have to be done in a certain way and everyone carries on regardless, or maybe no one has highlighted how important releasing software actually is.</p>
<p>Something else to take into account is the fact that different people within your organization will see (or not see) a given problem in different ways. Let's go back to ACME for a moment and examine the views of three personas (Stan the manager, Devina the developer, and Oscar the ops guy) in relation to having the software releases wholly controlled by the operations team:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><img src="assets/027c40d5-2265-4e97-bcaa-bc416037d17e.png" style=""/></div>
<p>As you can see, different people will have wildly different views depending on what part they play in the overall process. Again, for ease of understanding, this example only features three personas—in reality there will be many more people who will all have their own slightly different viewpoint; consider how a project manager, release manager, tech writer, SecOps, or even a CEO would see this specific scenario.</p>
<p>For the sake of argument, let's assume that you do indeed have some problems releasing your software with ease and want to understand what the root cause is—or most likely the root causes are—so that you can make the overall process more efficient, effective, and streamlined. As stated, before you <strong>can</strong> adapt you <strong>need</strong> to inspect—this is the fundamental premise of most agile methodologies. The following chapter will surface some of the approaches and techniques that will help in this.</p>
<p>Throughout this chapter we will explore the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to identify potential issues and problems within your software delivery process</li>
<li>How to surface them without resorting to the blame-game</li>
<li>How it can sometimes be tough to be honest and open, but that doing so provides the best results</li>
<li>How different people within your organization will see the same problem(s) in different ways</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we start looking into how to inspect, I would like to go off on a slight tangent and talk about a large (normally) gray mammal.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Elephant in the room</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Some of us have a very real and worrying ailment that blights our working lives, elephant in the room blindness—or to give it its medical name, Pachyderm in situ vision impairedness. Those inflicted are aware of a big problem or issue that is in their way, impeding their progress, efficiency, and willingness to engage and draining their morale. What do these poor souls normally do? They normally choose to either simply accept it or worse still, ignore it—depending on the size of the problem. Those that don't bury their heads in the sand, so to speak, then find ingenious ways to work around, <span>circumvent, or avoid</span> said problem by making very localized changes to how they work. Sometimes, at the detriment to others. In fact, they normally invest a lot of effort, time, and money in building these ingenious solutions and then <span>convince themselves and their leadership that this is the best thing to do.</span></p>
<p>To stretch this metaphor a little more—please bear with me, there is a point to this—I would like to turn to the world of art. The artist Banksy exhibited a piece of living artwork as part of his 2006 Barely Legal exhibition in Los Angeles. This living artwork was in the form of an adult Indian elephant standing in a makeshift living room with floral print on the walls. The elephant was also <em>painted</em> head to toe with the same floral pattern. The piece was entitled—as luck would have it—elephant in the room. It seems ludicrous at first and you can clearly see that there is a massive 12,000 lb. elephant standing there; while it has been painted to blend in with its surroundings, it is still a massive elephant stood there in plain sight. This brings me to my point, the problems and issues within a software delivery process are just like the elephant and it is just as ludicrous that we simply ignore—or accept without question—their existence.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Just like real life, the software delivery process elephant in the room is not hard to spot. It's normally sitting/standing/lurking where everyone can see. You just need to be willing to look, know how to look, and what to look for. Once you've mastered this, exposing it's existence is far easier.</div>
<p>Through the remainder of this chapter, we'll go through some ways to help highlight the existence of the elephant in the room and, more importantly, how to ensure as many people as possible can also see it and realize that it's not something to be avoided, worked around, or ignored.</p>
<p>Before you start removing the figurative floral pattern from the figurative elephant, there's still some legwork you need to do.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>With any examination, expose, investigation, or inspection there will be, to some degree, dirt that will need to be dug up—figuratively speaking. This is inevitable and should not be taken lightly or treated flippantly. The sort of questions that will be asked will include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why are things done in certain ways?</li>
<li>Who came up with this process in the first place?</li>
<li>Who makes the priority decisions to do one thing over another and what right to they have to make the decision?</li>
<li>When exactly are these decisions made?</li>
<li>Who owns the overall product delivery process?</li>
<li>Who owns the various steps within the process?</li>
<li>Has anyone previously questioned the process? If so, what happened?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Does anyone actually know how the process works end to end?</li>
<li>Why can't the management see the obvious issues and why don't they listen to us?</li>
</ul>
<p>These types of questions may well make some people very uncomfortable and may bring to light facts that produce emotive responses or emotional reactions—especially from those that may have originally had a hand in designing and/or implementing the very process that you are putting under scrutiny. Even if they can see and understand that the process they nurtured is broken, they still may have an emotional attachment to it—especially if they have been involved for a long time. You need to be mindful that these self-same people may be needed to help replace and/or refine the process, so tread carefully.</p>
<p>To keep things on a purely professional level, you should map out some ground rules that clearly define what the investigation is for and what its goal is. These need to be clear, concise, and easy for everyone involved to understand and worded in a positive way. The sorts of things you should be looking at are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>We're trying to understand how the end to end process as it stands came to be</li>
<li>We need to understand what business/legislative/legal constraints there are </li>
<li>We need to see how the many and varied process link together to form the end to end process</li>
<li>We need to verify if our process(es) actually work for us and the wider business</li>
<li>We want to surface issues and problems so that everyone can see them and help fix them</li>
<li>We want to make things better</li>
</ul>
<p>To further ensure you minimize the emotional reactions, you should define some rules of engagement so that everyone involved understands where the line is and when it is about to be crossed. Again, keeping these rules simple, concise, and using positive language will help everyone understand and remember them. Good examples would include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>No naming and shaming</li>
<li>No personal attacks or witch hunting</li>
<li>This is not a post mortem</li>
<li>There are no right or wrong answers</li>
<li>No detail is too trivial</li>
<li>Stick to facts over fiction</li>
<li>Leave egos at the door</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox">Retrospection can be a powerful tool to gain a greater understanding of what can be improved, but if used incorrectly it can cause more trouble than good—you can shoot yourself in the foot many, many times if you approach this without some foresight. You need to make sure you know what you are letting yourself in for, before you embark on this sort of activity.</div>
<p>Let's now consider who you will need to be involved with and who will add the most value. Hopefully, this will be one and the same, but it's not always that simple or obvious.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Including (almost) everyone</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>What you need is information and insight from individuals who can actively contribute, are engaged, are ideally open to change (or at least would like to see things change for the better) and understand and agree to the aforementioned rules. These engaged contributors should come from all parts of the business—if they are involved in product creation and delivery, they should be considered. You will need a broad set of information and data to move forward, therefore you need to get a broad set of engaged contributors involved.</p>
<p>To ensure you can identify as many people as possible, you will need to establish a good network across the organization or at the very least access to those who already have one—especially if your organization is sizable as it's not practical to identify and be on speaking terms with everyone. You will normally find that individuals who have been around for a good while normally have a well-formed and mature internal network you can tap into.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">Individuals who work in product support, business analysis, product management, sales and marketing, or project management are good people to seek out as they will spend most of their working lives forming relationships and networks with various people around the organization.</div>
<p>You should proactively engage with these individuals and explain what you're trying to do—remember the aforementioned positively worded goals and rules of engagement—and ask them to help build up your list. If you can also add them to the engaged contributors list then that will speed things up as they can do some of the evangelizing and leg work for you. </p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<div class="packt_quote packt_tip"><span>As the title of this section implies, although you will have the best intentions to include everyone involved in or affec</span><span>ted by the software delivery process, this is not be realistic nor practical—especially in large organizations—so if you can get almost everyone involved, that should suffice. </span></div>
<p>As you start compiling the list of participants—which for a large organization can be quite daunting, demanding and not without effort on your part—you will no doubt find that there will be some degree of natural selection as you start to ask people to contribute; some may say they're too busy, some won't want to be involved for reasons they don't want to disclose, some may simply not care enough either way.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Identifying key people</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>While compiling the list of engaged contributors, you should also identify the key people within the overall process. These key people may not be obvious at first; however, asking the same simple questions of a number of different people from different parts of the business during your network building will give you some strong indications as to how key the individuals are. Examples of these simple questions would be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Who do you feel should I ensure I invite to this?</span></li>
<li><span>Who do you normally talk to if there's a problem?</span></li>
<li><span>Who knows how this all works?</span></li>
<li><span>Who normally makes changes to the process?</span></li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a very strong possibility that many of this key people will be the ones who say they are too busy. The fact that they are too busy may be directly attributed to the fact that the process they are working in is broken, but they don't have time to stop and realize this. I would highly recommend that you take a little more time to ensure that those key people who fit into this category are encouraged, cajoled, and convinced to take part. <span>For example, you'll need be very flexible in terms of aligning to their availability—this may mean changing your plans at short notice just to get 15 minutes with them; however, I would encourage you to do this as </span>disengaged contributors<span> can easily become </span>active detractors<span> later down the line.</span></p>
<div class="packt_tip">If certain individuals are key, it sometimes helps to let them know this, as an ego boost can sometimes help win them over. Also, playing the "If you don't take this opportunity to sort things out for the better, someone else might and it might be worse" card sometimes works.</div>
<p>You will no doubt also come across individuals who are very (sometimes overly) eager to be involved simply because they have an axe to grind or need a soapbox to proclaim their personal opinion. These individuals aren't that obvious to spot, however with a few well-placed questions their intentions become more obvious—especially when their responses seem biased and include words and/or phrases such as blame, fault, them, or not my problem. If these individuals want to be involved then that's fine, but you need to be mindful of the fact that such people can potentially derail the process—which again may be why they want to be involved. One word of warning; do not simply dismiss these individuals out of hand as they may have valuable observations to bring forward and dismissing them may foster further negativity and make them very vocal active detractors. You should however ensure these individuals agree to be engaged contributors and understand the ground rules you have set. During the next stage, you will no doubt need to keep an eye on them—much like the naughty children of the class—so that disruption and negativity are kept in check. That said, you may be surprised at how much value they bring to the process.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As you build your list of engaged contributors you may well encounter a positive problem—you simply have too many people who want to be involved. In some respects, this is a good thing—over-subscription is a nice problem to have as you will be able to capture more valuable data—however this can cause problems—but things can get disorganized and noisy very quickly if you don't manage this part of the process.</p>
<p>If you do have over-subscription, rather than dropping people from the list, you should consider running multiple sessions. We'll cover the format of the session(s) in more detail later but suffice to say they can turn out to be very interactive with a high degree of active participation. As such, I would advise you try and keep the numbers for each session down to a manageable level, otherwise you will end up with too many voices and opinions generating too much noise and too many discussions going off at tangents to each other. You should also ensure that each session has an even mix of individuals from different parts of the business (for example, don't just run a developers session followed by an operations session followed by a project managers session—mix things up) as you want input from a broad spectrum.</p>
<div class="packt_tip"><span>A rule of thumb would be that 20-30 participants as more than enough for each session—unless you're a very experienced facilitator, you will struggle to keep things orderly and focused.</span></div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>You will also encounter a physical challenge whereby you need to be in two or three places at once—unless you have mastered the art of cloning or astral projection, that's simply not possible. You should therefore run the sessions sequentially rather than concurrently thus giving yourself a gap to rest and compile the data captured. If this isn't possible, then you should consider enlisting one or more co-facilitators you feel have the same goals, drives, and passion you do in relation to revealing the elephant. A word of warning here: you all need to be very aligned in your approach; otherwise, you may skew the data.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">If you do end up running multiple sessions, ensure that each participant only attends one of the sessions—especially those of an axe-grinding persuasion. You want to ensure everyone has an equal voice.</div>
<p>To all intents and purposes the preceding equates to this: you need to engage and include as many different people as possible who are actively involved in the process of defining, building, testing, shipping, and supporting software within your organization. The wider the net is cast the more relevant the information and data you will catch, so to speak.</p>
<p>Not only is the way in which the investigation is to be conducted and who is involved very important, it is also vitally important that you ensure the environment is set up correctly to allow for those attending to be open, transparent, and more importantly honest—this will also encourage appropriate behaviors to surface. We'll be looking into behaviors in more detail later, but for now let's concentrate on the aforementioned three key areas. </p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>To truly get to the bottom of a given problem, you need to gather as much information and data about it as possible, so that you can collectively analyze and agree the best way to overcome or address it—you need to know how big the elephant truly is before you can expose it and remove it. The natural reaction of most senior management types—especially those in the higher MBA educated echelons—will be to <span>then enlist a costly business change consultancy agency to </span>run a closed-session top-level investigation with a handpicked select few from middle management to take part to produce a management report.</p>
<p>Although this well-trodden approach may provide some information and data, I would argue that it will not give you or the business what you need. In addition, during these types of investigations the environment is normally such that attendees<span> </span>will<span> feel watched and intimidated therefore will not feel </span>free<span> to be honest and </span>disclose<span> pertinent pieces of information—just in case this adds a black mark to their record and/or career.</span> Because of this, basic human nature will kick in and things will be missed, individuals may simply forget an important detail, or worse still some of the information may be misinterpreted or simply taken it out of context. All in all, closed-session investigations are a hotbed for distrust, non-disclosure, disengagement, blinkered points of view, and <span>secrecy.</span></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Secrets hiding the truth</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As previously mentioned, to realistically get the level of information and engagement required, you need to create an open and transparent environment in which positive behaviors can flourish. An environment where trust, honesty, disclosure, and constructive dialogue are encouraged and commonplace. This does not mean you have to work within a glass house and have every conversation in public and every decision made by committee. What is needed is <strong>a distinct lack of secrets</strong>.</p>
<p>Let me clarify what I mean by using an example: Bernie is the CEO of a small but successful software business. Over the last few months, more and more customers have started to complain about broken promises and obviously rushed and buggy releases. She is also hearing that employees are not happy and productivity is down. She considers the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Begrudgingly admit that there may be a few problems that need addressing and instruct the VP of engineering to handpick a team of people he trusts to compile a list of solutions to present back to the board within the week. The VP will under orders to not disclose or discuss this with anyone outside of the closed group.</li>
<li>Commission an external consultancy to run a top-level closes-session investigation.</li>
<li>Invite every employee to an all day workshop and ask everybody to provide open and honest feedback about the issues they face day to day. She will then get her leadership team together and spend a few weeks openly working through all of the feedback. A follow-up workshop will then be arranged to honestly discuss and debate the various problems raised and options available.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it's plain to see the difference, and which of these approaches would bear fruit and which would wither and die.</p>
<p>This all may sound unrealistically simple but without openness, honesty, and transparency, people will remain guarded and you will not get all of the facts you need—the word "facts" is used intentionally. You need an environment where anyone and everyone feels that they can speak their minds and more importantly, contribute. One other thing you need to take into account is collaboration.</p>

<p>Ideally, you should plan to run your investigation(s) collocated (so that everyone is in the same physical location) as this allows for greater human interaction, building of rapport—which is essential for building trust—and the general ebb and flow of conversation in what can be highly interactive exercises. </p>
<div class="packt_tip">You may want to consider running these sessions on neutral ground (for example, a conference room in a local hotel or a shared office complex) which not only puts people at ease but provides some focus away from the office and its day to day distractions.</div>
<p>Realistically, you may well have remote teams or individuals who you need to be involved. Some may work from home or another office or in another country. If this is the case, you'll need to be a little more creative in how you approach things as you'll need to make things as seamless as possible. As stated previously, the ideal situation is to have everyone you need in the same place. Depending on the numbers of individuals involved and where they normally physically reside will determine the best approach to take—for example, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the majority of the engaged contributors<span> are</span> collocated in one office, then consider bringing the remote team(s) or individuals to them—budget permitting</li>
<li>If the majority of the engaged contributors are based in a remote location, then consider taking the the local team(s) or individuals to them—again, budget permitting</li>
<li>If neither of these are viable, then consider using a reliable and high quality video conferencing solution (voice conferencing just isn't good enough for what you'll be doing) along with some real time collaboration software</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are forced to run the session(s) across two or more locations, then you may also need take into account challenges around time zones and come up with workable options (that is, don't expect your Boston-based team to remotely attend a workshop at 5:00 EST just because it's easier for the UK team). There will have to be some creative planning around this.</p>
<p>As you can see, before you embark on the challenge of exposing the elephant in the room, there is some pre-work preparation you need to do.</p>
<p>Throughout this chapter, you have been introduced to terms such as "investigation", "elephant exposure", and "retrospection". In relation to your software delivery process, these all mean pretty much the same thing: gathering information and data on how the process works end to end so that you can highlight the issues, which can then be rectified. We'll now move on to some of the ways you can gather this information and data, but before we do, let's clear a few things up.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Some of you of a technical ilk may be reading this chapter wondering who it's targeted at and thinking "Surely, this is all soft skill people management self-help waffle and doesn't really apply to me". In some respects, this is very true; any good manager or leader worth their salt should at least know how to approach this type of activity, but you have to take into account the very real fact—an ineffectual process has a greater impact on those within it than those who are perceived to be running it. Put simply, if as an engineer your effectiveness, moral, and enjoyment of your role is impacted by a process that you feel is broken and needs changing, then you have as much right and responsibility to help change it for the better as anyone else. In my experience, the best engineers are those who can examine, understand, and solve complex problems—be they technical in nature or not. In addition, who better to have on board while trying to find out the problems with a process than those directly involved in it and affected by it?</p>
<p>If you're a software engineer or an operations engineer, or a project manager or a build and release engineer, or a QA engineer or anyone else involved in delivering software, and you're stuck in a process that slows you down and impacts your ability to effectively do your job, then I would strongly encourage you to get involved with investigating and help to highlight the problems (there will be many and some may not be as obvious to you as you first think). Yes is can be daunting and yes if you're employed to analyze requirements or design systems or cut code or look after the infrastructure then you'll be asking yourself why you should get involved in what equates to business analysis. It's simple really; if you don't do anything then someone else might, and it may get worse.</p>
<p>If you're a manager or leader, then I encourage you to lead by example and get involved. More importantly, you should proactively encourage all members of your team(s) to get involved as well—even if it means taking them away from their day jobs for a relatively short period of time. As stated previously, they are the individuals who are living within the process day to day and by implication know the process very intimately—far better than you I would wager. As a leader, some team members may need your help, some may need encouragement, some may need training or coaching, some may need empowerment, and some may need all of these. In the long run, it will be worth it.</p>
<p>Not only should you encourage the troops to be actively involved, you should also use your influence and encourage your peer group to do the same. On the face of it, this may seem easy to achieve but it can be quite a challenge, especially where other managers start putting roadblocks in your way. The sorts of challenges you going to up against will include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convincing them it is a good and worthwhile thing to do</li>
<li>Getting them to agree to allow many of their team to stop doing their day jobs for a few hours so that they can participate</li>
<li>Getting them to agree to listen and to not drive the agenda</li>
<li>Getting them to be open and honest within a wider peer group</li>
<li>Ensuring that they allow subordinates to be open and honest without fear of retribution</li>
<li>Getting them to trust you</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can imagine, you may well be involved in many different kinds of delicate conversations with many people, roles, and egos across the business. As I mentioned previously, in relation to convincing the key people to get involved, you should again consider using some simple human psychology to appeal to their better natures. It won't be easy, but the perseverance will be worth it in the long run.</p>
<p>Now that that's cleared up, let's move on to the fun part—exposing the elephant.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">The great elephant disclosure</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Let's presume at this point that you have overcome all of the challenges of getting people in the same location (physically and/or virtually), you have obtained buy-in from the various management teams, have agreed some downtime, and have a safe environment set up in a neutral venue. You're almost ready to embark on the elephant disclosure—almost. What you now need to do is actually pull everyone together and run the workshop(s) to capture the data you need.</p>
<p>To make things a little less daunting it may help to consider your overall end to end process as four distinct stages:</p>
<p><img src="assets/89674f94-5f03-43c7-b559-aea55ada1a7e.png"/></p>
<div class="mce-root packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Four distinct phases of a typical end to end software delivery process</div>
<p>Breaking the overall process into these smaller stages can assist in mapping out the flow and structure of the workshop(s) you'll be facilitating. For example, if you decide to run an all-day workshop you can break this down into multiple sessions, each focusing on a specific stage, then bring everything together at the end. An example workshop agenda would look something like this:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px" class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><img src="assets/38590d70-ceac-463a-b11e-c03901cec379.png" style=""/></div>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">As you can see from this, these types of workshops can turn into a very long day—especially with a large group of people—so it's vitally important you are very organized and keep things on track throughout. Just trying to wing it will not give you the results you need. Some may consider compressing the overall time taken by removing the various breaks, however these breaks are very valuable as they allow for rapport building and guard dropping and also allow for the participant's brain to inwardly digest the information being disclosed and discussed.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Scheduling such workshops across multiple sites and/or time zones can be extremely complex and challenging, which is why running collocated workshops are preferable.</div>
<p>It is possible to run these types of workshops over two days, however I would recommend that you don't leave too large a gap between them otherwise focus will be lost and participants—especially those key people you identified—may get dragged into day to day problems. If you need to split the workshop, I would recommend that you schedule the day one workshop to finish late in the day and start day two first thing the following morning.</p>
<p>To ensure things go as smoothly as possible—considering the challenges you'll have keeping everyone focused and on track—I would recommend you keep things as simple and obvious as possible, not only for your sake but also for the participants. To this end, you'll need to prepare two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>You'll need the staple tool-set of any agile practitioner/facilitator: some big blank walls covered in paper, some large whiteboards, some flip charts, some sticky notes, various colored pens, and various colored stickers, some space, plenty of snacks, and a little bit of patience</li>
<li>You'll need to pick a tried and tested agile technique that provides the format for the workshop itself</li>
</ul>
<p>With regards to point #2, this is where I would have loved to provide pages of detailed explanation on the many varied and proven techniques and exercises with wonderful names such as StoStaKee, the Starfish, and the Sailboat, however this would make a book in itself.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">Before you send out invites to the workshop(s), you should ensure all concerned are aware of the format—as you'll be asking them to trawl back through their memories they may want to bring some pre-prepared notes along with them so plenty of notice will speed things up.</div>
<p>Let's move on from planning to doing. </p>

<p><span>As stated, there are many agile tools and techniques available to you, however for the sake of space I'll include reference to these within the <a href="b212024b-5ba5-4f01-b76d-a8367c6ec41c.xhtml">Appendix A</a>, <em>Some Useful Information</em>, and we'll focus on two in particular that have proven to be highly effective over the years; those being timeline and value stream mapping.</span></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Timeline</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The timeline retrospective technique is an agile tool to look back over a specific period of time and capture key data points and information to help drive forward positive changes. These data points normally relate to specific events/challenges (such as a project kick-off or a budget cut after a quarterly review or a power cut that took all the production servers offline) but also can surface regular patterns of behavior, communication break-down, bad planning, and inefficient processes.</p>
<p>As you will be looking back over a period of time and surfacing details of things that happened (or didn't as the case may be), it's always a good idea to narrow down what you will be examining. From experience, you should consider a specific large and complex project or a business initiative or a specific release—I'm sure you'll also have some other ideas. As you are trying to expose problems and issues within your delivery process, I would not recommend picking something that went swimmingly well at this stage as you might not learn as much as you could—that can come later down the line to ensure any changes made have had a positive impact. Whatever you pick should be the focus for the workshop(s).</p>
<p>The format of a timeline retrospective is quite simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>You define and agree the timeline (that is, start date—end date) and draw that horizontally along a wide wall (or rather on the paper covering the wall).</li>
<li>You then break this down into smaller periods of time (that is, months or weeks) and mark those points along the timeline.</li>
<li>Next, you get all participants to<span> write out sticky notes related to notable events that they remember during the period in question and ask them to add these to the timeline on the wall (if you have remote members taking part ask someone within the room to act as proxy for them). There is no limit to the number of notes—encourage participants to keep going as long as possible.</span></li>
<li>As this goes on you will start to see groups of similar event notes forming—you should encourage the participants to start grouping these together. Some of these specific event notes may occur more than once throughout the timeline indicating a pervasive problem.</li>
<li>If there are no more event notes to add you should then instruct the group to mark the notes with colors (either stickers or with a marker) indicating how they feel about the event—green for glad, blue for sad, or red for mad.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Throughout these, you should be actively encouraging open and honest discussion throughout the participants—maybe picking on specific event notes and asking questions such as "Is there any more detail to add?" or "Did anyone else notice this?" or "Did this happen more than once?"</p>
<p>You will now have a highly visual representation of what events happened over the timeline and how these events made people feel. You can then facilitate <span>an open and honest </span>group discussion applying some focus on those events that provoked the most emotions. During this discussion, some solutions may be put forward to resolve the pains—these should be noted for later use but hold off agreeing on an action plan for the moment.</p>
<p>The following depicts an example output from a timeline workshop representing a rather painful project and should give you some ideas of what you should end up with:</p>

<p>Another proven and well-documented technique is value stream mapping. </p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Value stream mapping</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This lean technique derives from—as quite a few agile methodologies and tools do—manufacturing and it has been around, in one guise or another, for many years. As with any lean methodology/tool/technique, value stream mapping revolves around a value versus waste model. In essence, a value stream map is a way to breakdown a product delivery process into a series of steps and handover points; it can also be used to help calculate efficiency rates if that's useful to you. The overall map can be laid out and analyzed to see where bottlenecks or delays occur within the flow; in other words, which steps are not adding value. The key metric used within value stream mapping is the lead time (for example, how long before the original idea starts making hard cash for the business).</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">There are lots of resources and reference materials available to detail how to pull together a value stream map and there are a good number of specialists in this area should you need some assistance.</div>
<p>kTo effectively create a value stream map, you will need a number of people across all areas of the business who have a very clear and, preferably hands on, understanding of each stage of the product delivery process—sometimes referred to as the product life cycle. If you have done your legwork effectively, you should have those individuals in the workshop. Ideally, a value stream map should represent a business process; however, this may be too daunting and convoluted at first. To keep things simple, it may be more beneficial to pick a recent example project and/or release and break that down.</p>
<p>As an example, let's go through the flow of a single feature request delivered by the ACME systems Version 2.0 business (before they saw the light):</p>
<p><img src="assets/c1be6903-a550-43ce-9313-2960f5f52f64.png"/></p>
<p>Each box represents a step within the overall process. The duration value within each box represents the working time (that is, how long it takes to go through each step). The duration value in each arrow represents the wait time between each step (that is, how long it took between each step).</p>
<p>This is a very simplistic overview but it does highlight how much time it can take to get even the most simplistic requirement out of the door. It also highlights how much waste there is in the process. Every step has a cost, every delay has a cost, and every mistake has a cost. The only real value you get is when the customer actually uses the software.</p>
<p>On the face of it, generating this type of map would be quite simple but it can also be quite a challenge. This simplistic diagram is created in real-time with input from many different areas of the business. There will be lots of open and honest dialogue and debate as facts are verified, memories jogged, dates and times corroborated, examples clarified, and agreements reached across the board as to what actually happens.</p>
<p>If you prefer to use the standard value stream mapping terminology and iconography, you could take the sticky notes version and convert it into something like the following, which again represents the flow of feature requests through the business:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><img src="assets/4e2f6c8e-abb3-4ad0-9a80-0bc4278e5651.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figure packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">This diagram also includes the efficiency (which is based upon the amount of time value is being added versus dead time within the flow)</div>
<p>The most valuable output from this particular technique is that you can spot the obvious areas of waste. These are the parts of the overall process that are slowing down and impeding your overall ability to deliver. With this information, you can now focus on these problem areas and start to look at options that will make them less wasteful and more valuable to the overall process.</p>
<p>As previously stated, there are many other techniques you can use to provide similar data, some of which will be included in the <a href="b212024b-5ba5-4f01-b76d-a8367c6ec41c.xhtml">Appendix A</a>, <em>Some Useful Information</em>.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Throughout this chapter, you have been given an insight into the following aspects: how to expose problems within your product delivery process (what we're calling the elephant in the room), the challenges and benefits of using collaborative and engaging approaches to identify these problems, and some effective tools and techniques to help you break down the problems into easily identifiable chunks of work.</p>
<p>Now, you know how to obtain valuable information and data about your problem(s) and have some much-needed actions to work with. You also now know how to inspect. Let's presume these problems revolve around the waste created through long release cycles and a siloed organization. That being the case, you have a very clear objective that will almost certainly address the problems and deliver what the entire business needs. All you now need to do is pull together a plan of attack to implement it. In other words, you now need to adapt. Which is handy as that's what we'll be covering very soon.</p>
<p>Before we do that, I want to delve a little further into the human side of CD and DevOps and highlight two areas that are pivotal to the success or failure of adoption; those being culture and behaviors. In the next chapter, we'll take a deep dive into how culture and behaviors can impact the CD and DevOps adoption—both positively and negatively, and why ignoring this is not a good idea. </p>
