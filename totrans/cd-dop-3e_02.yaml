    Software Delivery*, you were introduced to ACME systems and given an insight into
    how it realized that there were problems with its software delivery process (severely
    impacting its ability to meet the expectations of its customers and deliver value
    to them), how it identified and addressed these problems, evolved, and after some
    hard work, determination, and time, adopted CD and DevOps ways of working to overcome
    them.

    make it easier for you the reader to follow. Real life is never that simple, but
    there are a number of key points that were raised during the storytelling that
    do apply to real-life businesses. The most important of these for any business
    considering—or actively pursuing—the adoption of CD and/or DevOps is that there
    has to be a reason for said adoption. CD and DevOps, like any solution, can help
    you solve a problem—or set of problems—but you need to truly understand and quantify
    the problem(s) beforehand; otherwise, you'll never know for sure whether the solution
    has helped.

    elephant in the room blindness—or to give it its medical name, Pachyderm in situ
    vision impairedness. Those inflicted are aware of a big problem or issue that
    is in their way, impeding their progress, efficiency, and willingness to engage
    and draining their morale. What do these poor souls normally do? They normally
    choose to either simply accept it or worse still, ignore it—depending on the size
    of the problem. Those that don't bury their heads in the sand, so to speak, then
    find ingenious ways to work around, circumvent, or avoid said problem by making
    very localized changes to how they work. Sometimes, at the detriment to others.
    In fact, they normally invest a lot of effort, time, and money in building these
    ingenious solutions and then convince themselves and their leadership that this
    is the best thing to do.

    to this—I would like to turn to the world of art. The artist Banksy exhibited
    a piece of living artwork as part of his 2006 Barely Legal exhibition in Los Angeles.
    This living artwork was in the form of an adult Indian elephant standing in a
    makeshift living room with floral print on the walls. The elephant was also *painted*
    head to toe with the same floral pattern. The piece was entitled—as luck would
    have it—elephant in the room. It seems ludicrous at first and you can clearly
    see that there is a massive 12,000 lb. elephant standing there; while it has been
    painted to blend in with its surroundings, it is still a massive elephant stood
    there in plain sight. This brings me to my point, the problems and issues within
    a software delivery process are just like the elephant and it is just as ludicrous
    that we simply ignore—or accept without question—their existence.

    some strong indications as to how key the individuals are. Examples of these simple

    the ones who say they are too busy. The fact that they are too busy may be directly
    attributed to the fact that the process they are working in is broken, but they
    don't have time to stop and realize this. I would highly recommend that you take
    a little more time to ensure that those key people who fit into this category
    are encouraged, cajoled, and convinced to take part. For example, you'll need
    be very flexible in terms of aligning to their availability—this may mean changing
    your plans at short notice just to get 15 minutes with them; however, I would
    encourage you to do this as disengaged contributors can easily become active detractors
    later down the line.

    however with a few well-placed questions their intentions become more obvious—especially
    when their responses seem biased and include words and/or phrases such as blame,
    fault, them, or not my problem. If these individuals want to be involved then
    that's fine, but you need to be mindful of the fact that such people can potentially
    derail the process—which again may be why they want to be involved. One word of
    warning; do not simply dismiss these individuals out of hand as they may have
    valuable observations to bring forward and dismissing them may foster further
    negativity and make them very vocal active detractors. You should however ensure
    these individuals agree to be engaged contributors and understand the ground rules
    you have set. During the next stage, you will no doubt need to keep an eye on
    them—much like the naughty children of the class—so that disruption and negativity
    are kept in check. That said, you may be surprised at how much value they bring

    keep the numbers for each session down to a manageable level, otherwise you will
    end up with too many voices and opinions generating too much noise and too many
    discussions going off at tangents to each other. You should also ensure that each
    session has an even mix of individuals from different parts of the business (for

    will feel watched and intimidated therefore will not feel free to be honest and
    disclose pertinent pieces of information—just in case this adds a black mark to
    their record and/or career. Because of this, basic human nature will kick in and
    things will be missed, individuals may simply forget an important detail, or worse
    still some of the information may be misinterpreted or simply taken it out of

    targeted at and thinking "Surely, this is all soft skill people management self-help
    waffle and doesn't really apply to me". In some respects, this is very true; any
    good manager or leader worth their salt should at least know how to approach this
    type of activity, but you have to take into account the very real fact—an ineffectual
    process has a greater impact on those within it than those who are perceived to
    be running it. Put simply, if as an engineer your effectiveness, moral, and enjoyment
    of your role is impacted by a process that you feel is broken and needs changing,
    then you have as much right and responsibility to help change it for the better
    as anyone else. In my experience, the best engineers are those who can examine,
    understand, and solve complex problems—be they technical in nature or not. In
    addition, who better to have on board while trying to find out the problems with
    a process than those directly involved in it and affected by it?

    with investigating and help to highlight the problems (there will be many and

    and yes if you're employed to analyze requirements or design systems or cut code

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The timeline retrospective technique is an agile tool to look back over a specific
    period of time and capture key data points and information to help drive forward
    positive changes. These data points normally relate to specific events/challenges
    (such as a project kick-off or a budget cut after a quarterly review or a power
    cut that took all the production servers offline) but also can surface regular
    patterns of behavior, communication break-down, bad planning, and inefficient
    processes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you will be looking back over a period of time and surfacing details of things
    that happened (or didn't as the case may be), it's always a good idea to narrow
    down what you will be examining. From experience, you should consider a specific
    large and complex project or a business initiative or a specific release—I'm sure
    you'll also have some other ideas. As you are trying to expose problems and issues
    within your delivery process, I would not recommend picking something that went
    swimmingly well at this stage as you might not learn as much as you could—that
    can come later down the line to ensure any changes made have had a positive impact.
    Whatever you pick should be the focus for the workshop(s).
  prefs: []

    events that they remember during the period in question and ask them to add these
    to the timeline on the wall (if you have remote members taking part ask someone

    notes—encourage participants to keep going as long as possible.

    a pervasive problem.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This lean technique derives from—as quite a few agile methodologies and tools
    do—manufacturing and it has been around, in one guise or another, for many years.
    As with any lean methodology/tool/technique, value stream mapping revolves around
    a value versus waste model. In essence, a value stream map is a way to breakdown
    a product delivery process into a series of steps and handover points; it can
    also be used to help calculate efficiency rates if that's useful to you. The overall
    map can be laid out and analyzed to see where bottlenecks or delays occur within
    the flow; in other words, which steps are not adding value. The key metric used
    within value stream mapping is the lead time (for example, how long before the
    original idea starts making hard cash for the business).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are lots of resources and reference materials available to detail how
    to pull together a value stream map and there are a good number of specialists

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    across all areas of the business who have a very clear and, preferably hands on,
    understanding of each stage of the product delivery process—sometimes referred
    to as the product life cycle. If you have done your legwork effectively, you should
    have those individuals in the workshop. Ideally, a value stream map should represent
    a business process; however, this may be too daunting and convoluted at first.
    To keep things simple, it may be more beneficial to pick a recent example project
    and/or release and break that down.

    take to get even the most simplistic requirement out of the door. It also highlights
    how much waste there is in the process. Every step has a cost, every delay has
    a cost, and every mistake has a cost. The only real value you get is when the
    customer actually uses the software.
