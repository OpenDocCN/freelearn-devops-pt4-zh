<p>Throughout <a href="03ef279d-c51d-4e35-a137-701636c17d5f.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Understanding Your Current Pain Points</em>, you were introduced to the tools and techniques to identify the problems you may well have with your overall product delivery process. We referred to this as the elephant in the room as it is something that is not hard to spot, just very easy to ignore.</p>
<p>We then drilled down a little further during <a href="17779905-1394-4db1-995e-04c6af9a5125.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Culture and Behaviors are the Cornerstones to Success</em>, to highlight (and in some ways reinforce) the fact that the culture and environment within which the teams working on and delivering changes operate has a massive impact on behaviors. This in turn impacts how they work and the quality of what they deliver.</p>
<p>We will now take these learnings and apply some focus on the various methods, approaches, techniques, and tools you can use to turn this into something that you can implement to overcome the challenges—a plan of attack to implement CD and DevOps, if you will.</p>
<p>Throughout this chapter you will be introduced to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why defining a goal and vision for your CD and DevOps adoption is very important</li>
<li>Why it's important to ensure that everyone understands what it is all about and is au fait with the language and terminology used</li>
<li>How to improve engagement and communication through the use of online collaborative solutions</li>
<li>Making sure the business understands the breadth of the implementation of CD and DevOps</li>
<li>Why effective PR, evangelism, courage, and determination are so important to the success of the project</li>
<li>The costs, some obvious and some not so, that must be taken into account before you embark on your adventure</li>
</ul>
<p>This plan of attack should not be taken lightly; just like the elephant exposure stage, there is quite a bit of groundwork you need to do to ensure the scope of the implementation is understood, accepted, and communicated.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the planning, let's have a look at the types of problems that you will no doubt be dealing with.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Some common problems</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>During your elephant exposure, you will have surfaced some problems with how you are currently delivering software. You will also start to consider the problems within your culture, environment, and the behaviors being exhibited.</p>
<p>The presumption here is that the problems identified are the commonplace issues related to most software delivery processes within most businesses around the globe. These will include some of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Waste from having too many handover and decision points in the process</li>
<li>Waste due to unnecessary wait time between steps</li>
<li>Many software changes are packaged up into large, complex big bang releases</li>
<li>Large and infrequent releases breed an environment for escaped defects and bugs and mistrust between those delivering change and those supporting it</li>
<li>Releases are seen as something to dread rather than a positive opportunity for change</li>
<li>Most of the team(s) are disengaged or there is low morale (or both)</li>
<li>Communication between key teams is fragmented, stilted, and sometimes non-existent</li>
<li>Software changes are not trusted until they have been tested many, many times. Even then, go-live is not without issue</li>
<li>Over-complex dependencies within the software design, which makes testing and releasing very challenging</li>
<li>There is duplication of tasks and activity throughout the process</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be ludicrous to say that simply creating a plan will solve all of the problems and issues—after all, some of the problems and issues may actually be due misaligned plans—however, without a plan it's going to be very hard to at least make a dent. Successful adoption of CD and DevOps can be hard enough as it is, so having a unified and understood approach will drastically improve your chances.</p>
<p>As with any plan or project, there needs to be an end goal and a vision of how to get there.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Setting and communicating goals and vision</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>A goal and vision for any project is important as it ensures all concerned know what is expected and for those working on the project understand where it, and they, are heading. It may sound quite simple, but it is not always obvious. In addition to setting the goal and vision, it is just as important what you communicate and how you do it. Do either incorrectly, and you are in danger of losing buy-in, support and engagement from the business. As pointed out in <a href="17779905-1394-4db1-995e-04c6af9a5125.xhtml"/><a href="17779905-1394-4db1-995e-04c6af9a5125.xhtml"/><a href="17779905-1394-4db1-995e-04c6af9a5125.xhtml"/><a href="17779905-1394-4db1-995e-04c6af9a5125.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Culture and Behaviors are the Cornerstones to Success</em>, the environment, culture, and default behaviors exhibited throughout the organization can help or hinder CD and DevOps adoption, so you need to be mindful of this when formulating the goal, vision, and communication approach.</p>
<p>These challenges can become very polarized when dealing with senior management. For example, they may believe that simply fixing a few of the issues highlighted during the elephant exposure will be enough to overcome every problem that the business has taken the time and effort to lay bare for all to see—as soon as you start to hear terms such as low-hanging fruit you should start to worry. A simple rule of thumb that has helped many business changes over the years is that you have to be crystal clear what you plan to achieve, and crystal clear who you are communicating this to.</p>
<p>When it comes to adopting CD and DevOps, this can be quite challenging as the deliverables and benefits are not always easy or obvious for the un-initiated to understand or envision. It may also be difficult to fully quantify as some of the benefits you obtain from the adoption are not wholly tangible—it can be quite hard to measure increases in team collaboration and happiness. Some leaders may align their decisions to<span> <strong>Return On Investment</strong></span> (<strong>ROI</strong>) models and only consider applying budget to such things where the return is very obvious and quantifiable. Again, this can be very hard to directly convert the advantages adopting CD and DevOps will give into a pure monetary value.</p>
<p>The best advice is to follow the <strong>keep it simple stupid</strong> (<strong>KISS </strong>) approach. You have a list of issues, which the wider business has provided for you, and what they want is something (anything) that will make their lives easier and allow them to do the jobs they were hired and are paid to do. I would also suggest that the majority would also like to have the opportunity to add value to the business, the customers and their self-worth. Regarding the list of issues, if truth be told, you most probably have more things on the list than you can effectively deliver. This should be seen as a good thing as you have some wriggle room when it comes to prioritization of the work.</p>
<p>Your challenge is to pull together a goal and vision, that will resonate with all of the stakeholders, employees and the wider business and ensure it is something that can add business value. More importantly, you need to ensure that the goal and vision can be delivered. This will need quite a bit of effort, thought, and planning, but it is doable. To give you some ideas, let's go back to ACME systems to see how they approached this.</p>
<p>When ACME systems were planning the adoption of CD and DevOps, it pooled together its ideas and came up with a goal for the project. This was pretty simple and self explanatory; to be able to release working code to production 10 times per day. It further simplified this to deliver value 10 times per day, which formed a nice simple tag line that everyone could understand (almost everyone, but we'll come to that soon) and formed the basis of its vision and communication strategy.</p>
<p>Yes, this was an ambitious goal but the company knew with some hard work, courage, determination, and the right people involved, it was possible to achieve.</p>
<p>Setting your goal may be just as easy. You have a good understanding of the business problems that need to be overcome, you know which teams are involved, and you have a good idea of what will resonate with the stakeholders. This may sound nice and simple, but it's true to say that with a blank whiteboard and a pen you will be able to fill most of the space up with example goals. Canvas opinion from people whose judgment you trust; if they think your proposed goal is way off the mark, it might just be so. If you're lucky enough to have PR or marketing people available, canvas their opinions; this is after all something they are pretty good at. Pulling together a top-level communication plan may also help to focus the message for the target audience(s).</p>
<p>Let's go back to the ACME systems again and see how it approached communication. They had a goal (deliver value 10 times per day) and needed to set out the vision. This vision included a wide variety of deliverables that it believed would solve a majority of the problems highlighted during their elephant exposure. These deliverables were both technical and non-technical in nature but above all were easy to understand, explain, and could all be clearly communicated. These deliverables were listed out, broken down and ranked to give an indication as to what would be addressed in what order. Those of you who are au fait with agile ways of working will recognize this as a prioritized feature backlog.</p>
<p>To reinforce this, it then worked on the business justification that would resonate with the stakeholders and business leadership. They did this by reviewing the list of problems and identifying those that directly related to cost—or more importantly wastage. The examples it focused on related to excessive repetitive manual test runs, repeated meetings attended by (expensive) senior leadership and cost of downtime for releases. To complement this, it also pulled together facts and figures relating to escaped defects and number of hotfixes required to address them.</p>
<p>The next step was to document and present the goal and vision to the decision makers in the business and the influential stakeholders to gain agreement that what was being proposed would address the problems and issues captured during the elephant exposure. This presentation was directed to as wide an audience as possible—not just the leadership—with many sessions booked over many days to allow as many people to be involved as possible. The preferred outcome was to gain agreement from those that had been involved in the original exercise to expose the elephant in the room to fully understand, get behind, and accept the proposed approach.</p>
<p>After much discussion, presenting, cajoling, and some time the goal and vision were agreed across the organization. With the vision agreed, it then went about breaking down the highest priority items of the vision (read, highest priority features) into requirements (read stories), which could be worked on and more importantly delivered.</p>
<p>The next step was to bring together a team of like-minded individuals to assist in the delivery—be that from a technical tooling perspective or education, coaching, and advisory capacity to help the wider team succeed in its goal.</p>
<p>To ensure transparency and ease of access to the goal and vision, the ACME systems team's members needed to ensure that all data, information, and plans were made available for all to see. To this end, they fully utilized all internal communication and project repository and reporting tools available to them: internal wikis, blogs, websites, intranets, and forums.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">If you don't have tools such as these available to you, it shouldn't be a vast amount of effort to get one set up using open source solutions. There are even online solutions that are secure enough to keep company secrets safe. Having this level of transparency and openness will help as you move forward with the execution of the plan. This is especially true of <em>social</em> solutions such as blogs and forums, where feedback can be given, and virtual discussions can take place.</div>

<p>It all sounds pretty simple when it's put down into a few paragraphs and to be honest it could be with the right environment and the right people involved. It's just a case of ensuring you and they have a good grasp of what the business and stakeholders want, how to summarize this into an easily understandable goal that people can relate to and get behind. It's the case of aligning the vision to drive things in the right direction. The key here is "easily understandable", which can sometimes be a challenge, especially when you consider how complex it can become communicating across many business areas (and possibly many time zones and cultures) who each have their own take on the terminology and vocabulary that may be used. This brings us nicely on to how you should communicate and ensure everyone involved understands what is happening.</p>

<p>One small and wholly avoidable thing that can scupper any project is the misinterpretation or confusion of what the deliverables are. This may sound a little alarming, but projects can fail simply because one person expects something, but another person misunderstands or misinterprets and delivers something else. It's not normally down to ignorance; it's normally due to both sides interpreting the same thing in different ways.</p>
<p>For example, let's look at something relatively innocuous; the word release. To a project manager or a release manager, this could represent a bundle of software changes, which need to be tested and put live within a schedule or program of work. This will normally entail detailed project plans, close coordination with all departments inside and outside of the product delivery function and lots of meetings, paperwork, and late nights. To a developer working in an agile way, a <em>release</em> could be a one-line code change, which could go live soon after they have completed coding and ran the automate tests. As you can see, one simple word can be perceived as something that will take a considerable amount of work by one member of a product delivery team member and perceived as something simple that just happens on a daily basis. These perceptions can cause lots of unforeseen and wasteful problems.</p>
<p>There can also be a bit of a problem when you start to examine all of the different words, terminology, and TLAs (three-letter acronyms) that we all use within product delivery and IT as a whole. We therefore need to be mindful of the target audiences we are communicating to and with to ensure they easily understand the message they are given. Again, the KISS method works well here. You don't necessarily have to go down to the lowest common denominator; that may be very hard to do (you could end up writing an entire book) and could make matters worse. Try to strike a balance. If some of the target audience don't easily understand, then get someone who does understand to talk with them and explain; this will help bridge the gaps and also form good working relationships.</p>
<p>Another suggestion to help bridge the gap is to pull together a glossary of terms that everyone can refer to. The following is a simple example:</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 100%" border="1">

<div class="packt_infobox">If you have an internal communication/collaboration tool such as a wiki or intranet or blog or forum, then that would be a good place to share this as others can update it over time as more buzzwords and TLAs are introduced.</div>
<p>The rule of thumb here is to ensure whatever vocabulary, language, or terminology you standardize on, you must stick to it and be consistent—chopping and changing at a whim can should be avoided. For example, if you choose to use the term CD and DevOps you should stick with it through all forms of communication, written and verbal. It then becomes ingrained and others will use it day to day, which means conversations will be consistent and there is much less risk of misinterpretation and confusion—failure to do this can and will lead to bad decisions being made.</p>
<p>One other thing to take into account is industry standard terms vs those that your business are used to. For example, if everyone throughout your business feels a shudder of dread when the word <em>release</em> is mentioned then don't try and change the meaning to match an industry standard as some will still associate the negative connotation. Instead, try using alternative terms—such as delivery—which will not have the historical baggage. All in all, chose your words carefully as they'll be with you for a while.</p>

<p>Let's move forward with the presumption that you now have a goal, a vision, a high-level backlog, a standard way of communicating, and you're ready to roll. Almost. The execution of the vision is not something to be taken lightly. Whether you are a small software shop or a large corporate, you should treat the adoption and implementation of CD and DevOps with as much gravitas as you would any other project, which touches and impacts many parts of the business. For example, you wouldn't implement a new finance and payroll system into the business as if it were a small-scale skunkworks project. Any change that impacts the wider business takes collaboration, close coordination, and planning. The adoption of CD and DevOps is not trivial and therefore should be seen in the same light.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">A business change project in its own right</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Classing the implementation and adoption of CD and DevOps as a business change project may seem a bit dry but that's exactly what it is; you are changing the way business operates, for the better. Not something to be taken lightly at all. If you have ever been involved in business change projects, you will understand how far-reaching they can be.</p>
<p>There's a high probability that the wider business may not understand this as well as you do. They have been involved in the investigation and have verified the findings and seen what you intend to do to address the issues raised. What they may not understand fully is the implication of implementing and adopting CD and DevOps—in terms of the business, it can be a life changing event. A little later in the book, we'll go through some of the hurdles you will face during the implementation, but if you have a heads-up from the start you're in a much better position to leap over the hurdles.</p>
<p>Suffice to say that you should ensure you get the business to recognize that the project will be something that will impact quite a few people, albeit in a positive way. The way certain parts of the business currently operate, the processes they have in place, the ways of working, and skillsets required will need to change. We not just talking about product development here either; adopting CD and DevOps will change the way the business thinks, plans, decides, and the speed at which it operates.</p>
<p>For example, let's assume that sales, marketing, product and program management teams are currently working on a three- to six-month cycle to take features to the market. If the CD and DevOps adoption goes to plan, the cycle will become much shorter, whereby a feature may be available in days or weeks:</p>
<p><img src="assets/d8b8ca5b-4ae4-4d18-b43b-debf05aa3e75.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">A typical multi-month software delivery cycle:</p>

<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><span>A typical agile software delivery cycle</span></div>
<p>The aforementioned teams will need to work at a different cadence and will have to speed up and streamline their processes, planning, and communication. They will also need to refine their go to market approach to ensure clients don't get shocked by getting features before they are ready to take them on.</p>
<p>From experience, the adoption of CD and DevOps and the consistent increased speed of delivery also brings some unexpected and very positive benefits—that being a renewed level of trust throughout the business that when the product delivery and operations team commit to deliver something they actually deliver it—time and time again. On the face of it, that's a good thing, however if downstream teams such as sales and marketing are used to feature deliveries being consistently delayed, they will have no doubt been factored into their plans, therefore having features delivered on time may actually take them by surprise.</p>
<p>It also means the whole end to end process can be streamlined as the traditional plan B, C and D—normally put into place if (when) things go wrong—is no longer required. The way features are delivered will drastically change, and the rest of the business needs to accept this and be ready for it.</p>
<p>When you start to consider the (positive) impacts adoption of CD and DevOps can and will have on the wider business, you can start to appreciate how careful you should approach it. If you have access to a program management team specializing in business change, then you would be wise to engage them so that they can help provide the overarching plan.</p>
<p>It should be noted that changes will not happen overnight, but history shows that businesses that truly adopt CD and DevOps are normally transformed in a matter of months (depending on size of the organization of course), so it's always best to have a plan to get ahead of the curve as things will creep up on you pretty fast.</p>
<p>Going back to the skunkworks example, you should be mindful that the adoption of CD and DevOps will initially be seen by the wider business as just that—some skunkworks project that the development and operations team need to implement to overcome their inefficiencies. What the business needs to appreciate is that the adoption of CD and DevOps is far bigger than that. The sooner they realize, the better. We'll now focus on that subject.</p>

<p>In the early stages of the adoption, the wider business will most probably believe that the impact of CD and DevOps—as the name suggests—will be localized to the development and operations teams. The following pretty standard diagram depicts the size of this bubble as the wider business will see it:</p>

<p>At first, this may not be too far from the truth and you will no doubt start small so that you can get to grips with the subtleties and to find your feet, as it were. This is fine; however, once you get some momentum—which will not take long—things will start to change very quickly and if people aren't ready, or at least aware, you may hit some barriers, obstacles, and pain points that could slow things down or even stop the adoption in its tracks.</p>
<p>As previously stated, the adoption of CD and DevOps is a business change project which—as the name implies—will impact the business itself, not just the techies. The business must therefore accept that the impact will be far reaching as depicted in this wider and more realistic bubble:</p>

<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">What the business should be seeing as representative of the areas that will be impacted and involved</div>
<p>If you think back to when the elephant in the room was exposed in <a href="03ef279d-c51d-4e35-a137-701636c17d5f.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Understanding Your Current Pain Points</em>, you'll recall that the wider, the wider business functions were involved in the activity of investigating, understanding, and highlighting the issues within the end to end business process. That being the case, they should not simply walk away from the hard bit and should stay engaged and actively involved in addressing and changing the ways of working to realize the benefits and eradicate the problems surfaced.</p>
<p>I don't want to sound like a stuck record, but adoption of CD and DevOps is not simply related the product delivery teams—the impacts and changes will be wide-reaching, therefore you need to ensure the wider business keep involved.</p>
<p>I think I've labored the point enough, so let's move forward with the presumption that the business is in agreement regarding the wide-reaching nature of the implementation and (almost) everyone is fully behind the project. The next challenge is deciding to form a dedicated team to drive forward the implementation of the goal and vision, and eventual CD and DevOps adoption.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">The pros and cons of a dedicated team</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>There are several schools of thought in relation to whether or not to have a dedicated and committed team overseeing the adoption of CD and DevOps. One school sees this as a necessary and logical move as only those with an interest in or experience/knowledge of CD and DevOps will actually understand the value of both/either and know (or at least have a pretty good idea) how it should be adopted. This is very true, however there are drawbacks—which we'll cover shortly. The other school suggests that this is a bad idea as it's not really that far removed from any other business change project, therefore can be managed through close collaboration and coordination without specialist knowledge. In truth, both schools are correct and also incorrect at the same time.</p>
<p>What it boils down to is this: if a dedicated team can get the adoption moving quickly, efficiently, and effectively then go for it, as long as they don't end up doing everything themselves in isolation and are therefore seen as the CD and DevOps team who just implement technical things and don't need/work with anyone else. As I've stated previously, just having a CD and/or DevOps team in your organization does not mean you have adopted CD and DevOps, it's far more complex than that. Like any successful business change project, a dedicated team should be there to help steer, guide, mentor, and coach the like-minded individuals (not just Dev and Ops) involved to collaborate and contribute while at the same time actively contributing themselves and focused on moving the adoption along. The sometimes overused business bingo term here is enablers or agents for change.</p>
<p>If you prefer to forgo a dedicated team and simply run the adoption as a business change project bringing in skills and individuals as when required, then you should at least need have someone(s) heavily involved who has a knowledge and/or experience of what CD and DevOps adoption actually means and can ensure the goal and vision are realized—without that, things may go off the rails somewhat. Something to also consider is whether or not the same sense of ownership and close collaboration will come out of a collection of individuals who occasionally work together vs a dedicated team who share a common goal and vision.</p>
<p>It really is your call, however my recommendation is to join the form a dedicated CD and DevOps adoption team school. You will need to ensure that the team is not wholly technical in experience/background, are willing and able and capable of working across the wider business, and more importantly have the ultimate goal of making themselves redundant. I don't mean they will lose their jobs, what I mean is that the dedicated team should be transient and once the CD and DevOps adoption has taken hold the team can be disbanded with little/no fuss and go back to their day jobs.</p>
<p>From past experience, the simplest way to decide on an approach is to go back to basics and list out the pros and cons as they apply to you and your business. Let's presume for ease of reading and page count that at this point you have decided to form a dedicated team—what's next?</p>
<p>As with any highly collaborative project, collocation of the team members is always preferable, however, not always possible. If you have geographically diverse (or dispersed) teams, then you need to ensure the you have members of the dedicated CD and DevOps adoption team in each location as they will need to be close to hand and in the same time zone as the people they are steering, guiding, mentoring, and coaching. They also need to work very closely together on a day to day basis—I would suggest you follow the tips and suggestions highlighted within <a href="17779905-1394-4db1-995e-04c6af9a5125.xhtml"/><a href="17779905-1394-4db1-995e-04c6af9a5125.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Culture and Behaviors are the Cornerstones to Success</em>, in relation to collaboration and the physical environment.</p>
<p>When we say dedicated, it means just that. The main day to day role of the team members will be to focus on doing whatever is needed to successfully implement the previously agreed goal. Now, it's not unusual to recruit or buy in a dedicated team from outside of the business but this isn't always a wise move as these individuals won't have the business domain knowledge or have an established connection to the wider business. That said, bringing in outside experts and/or individuals with experience in CD and DevOps adoption can help as long as they complement the core dedicated team. Again, this is really something you need to consider based upon your business needs, resource constraints, and budget.</p>
<p>Whatever you decide, you need to be mindful that you will be taking a number of key people out of the business and away from their day jobs for a considerable amount of time to focus solely on the implementation and adoption of CD and DevOps.</p>
<p>As soon as this is highlighted, I can pretty much guarantee that you will get some areas of the business take a big step back in terms of engagement—especially those areas which manage the very people you want to second onto your dedicated team. This is understandable as they will most probably be the subject matter experts in their area and are therefore pivotal to their existing team/functional area.</p>
<p>It is down to you to cajole, beg, bargain, and barter to get the people you need. To be honest, it shouldn't be too difficult as you have quite a large amount of ammunition to use—the same information and data you worked so hard to compile and which the business itself agreed was causing pain. If you used the value stream mapping exercise you should also be able to pinpoint the pain areas with accuracy. Let's take a typical discussion between you and the head of testing and QA—let's call him Chucky:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px" class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><img src="assets/21869549-5f97-4efc-97ea-ecb01c1856f8.png" style=""/></div>
<p>I admit it might not go exactly along those lines but hopefully you can see the point. You have been given a clear insight into what pains the business and have been asked to remove said pains. The business needs to realize that this will not come without some cost and that they need to provide you with what you need to get the job done.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">In relation to the setup of the dedicated CD and DevOps adoption team, that really depends on the way in which your business is set up. A typical business would normally have something like development, QA, operations, and change management teams involved in the software release process; therefore, you should include someone from each area. To make things as agile as possible, add a Scrum Master and a product owner and top it all off with a Senior Manager (someone who can act as the project sponsor and represent the team at a higher level), and you'll end up with something as shown in the following diagram:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px" class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><img src="assets/380fe67e-f6db-4b8a-a9b8-55b648d2178d.png" style=""/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">An example team setup</div>
<p>Now, that's all well and good but doesn't this simply look like a typical IT project team? In a word, yes. However, this is mainly due to the skills and experience within this area. CD and DevOps are historically derived from IT folks, and as such you don't tend to get many sales executives or accountants having a working understanding of CD and/or DevOps (unless they have read this book of course).</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, you should be proactively engaging with areas of the business that will be impacted, however you need to decide on who should be actively involved and who should be classed as stakeholders. The rule of thumb here should be if someone is actively involved and contributing on a day to day basis, they should be included in the dedicated team. If they have an interest or need to be consulted regularly, they should be stakeholders.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">One tool that would really help you here is RACI which allows you to define who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed—there's plenty of information available on RACI so I suggest you do some homework.</div>
<p>Just to reiterate, a dedicated team must be made up of more than just Devs and Ops if they are to have credibility across the wider business.</p>
<p>Now that you have the art of persuasion and positive influencing under your belt, you and your newly formed team need to learn the art of evangelism.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">The importance of evangelism</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>To evangelize across an entire business all of the time is going to take some effort and some determination. It will also take some energy. Actually, that's wrong; it will take a lot of energy. Your target audience is wide and far-reaching, from senior management to the shop floor, so it will take up quite an amount of time for you and your team to get the message across. Before we go into the details of what to say to who, when, and how, let's get the ground rules sorted:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are to be convincing when evangelizing to others the virtues of CD and DevOps adoption, you and your newly formed team need to truly believe in it—if you don't, then how can you expect others to?</li>
<li>You, the team, and whoever is involved in the project, must practice what you preach and set a good example for others to follow. For instance, if you build/implement some tools as part of the project, make sure you build and deploy them using the exact same techniques and tools you are evangelizing about.</li>
<li>Many (most) people will not get it at first, so you and the team will have to be very, very patient. You may have to explain the same thing to the same person more than once. Use these kinds of individuals as a yard stick; if they start to understand what CD and DevOps adoption is then there's a pretty good chance your message is hitting home.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Remember your target audience and tailor your message accordingly. Developers would want to hear technical stuff, which is new and shiny; system operators would want to hear words such as <em>stability</em> and <em>predictability</em>; and management types would want to hear about efficiencies, optimized processes, and risk reduction. Do not use one message for all.</li>
<li>As you evangelize and sing the praises of CD and DevOps adoption, ensure you are measuring the impact of your message—the rule of thumb is if you see their eyes glaze over, your message is not hitting home, so change it.</li>
<li>Some people will simply not want to know or listen, and it may not be worth focusing your efforts to make them (we'll be covering some of this in a <a href="17779905-1394-4db1-995e-04c6af9a5125.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Culture and Behaviors are the Cornerstones to Success</em>). If you can win them around, then kudos to you and the team but don't feel dejected by one or two laggards.</li>
<li>Keep it relevant and consistent. You have a standardized language, a goal, and a vision so use them.</li>
<li>Don't simply make stuff up. Just stick to what can be delivered as part of your goal and vision; no more, no less. If there are new ideas and suggestions get them added to the backlog for prioritization.</li>
<li>Don't, on any account, give up.</li>
</ul>
<p>What it boils down to is you and the team will need to talk the talk and walk the walk. There will be quite a bit of networking going on so be prepared for lots and lots of discussion. As your network grows so will your opportunities to evangelize. Do not shy away from these opportunities, and make sure you are using them to build good working relationships across the business as you're going to need these later on. Evangelizing is rewarding and if you really believe that CD and DevOps is the best thing since sliced bread you will find that having opportunities to simply talk about it with others is like a busman's holiday.</p>
<p>Evangelism is basically PR so if you have PR people available (or better still as part of the team) you should also investigate getting simple things together like a logo or some freebies (such as badges, mugs, mouse mats, and so on) to hand out. This may seem a little superfluous, but as with any PR you want to ensure you get the message across and have it embedded into the environment and people's psyches.</p>
<p>Up until this point, I may have painted things in a somewhat rosy glow. Adopting CD and Dev Ops is no picnic in the park. There's quite a big hill to climb for all concerned. As long as everyone involved is aware of this and has the courage and determination to succeed, things should go well.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Courage and determination may seem like strong words to use, but they are the correct words. There will be many challenges, some you are aware of some you are not, that will try to impede the progress, so determination is required to ensure this keeps moving in the right direction. Courage is needed as some of these challenges will require you, the team, and the wider business to make difficult decisions, which could result in actions being taken from which there is no going back. I'll refer to ACME systems Version 2.0 for a good example of this.</p>
<p>In the early days of their adoption of CD and DevOps, they started with a small subset of their platform as the candidates for releasing using the new deployment toolset and ways of working. Unfortunately, at the same time there was a lot of noise being generated around the business as another release (using the old <em>package everything up and push out as one huge deployment</em> method) was not going well. The business asked everyone to focus on getting the release out at all costs, including halting the CD trials. This didn't go down too well with the team. However, after a rather courageous discussion between the senior manager of the ACME CD and DevOps adoption team and his peers, it was agreed that resource could be allocated if there was universal agreement that this would be the last of the big bang releases, and that all future releases would use the new CD pipeline process going forward. The agreement was forthcoming, and so ended the era of the big bang release and the new era of CD and DevOps dawned. After the last of the big bang releases was eventually completed, the entire development and operations teams were determined to get CD up and running as soon as possible.</p>
<p>They had been through enough pain and needed another way or rather <em>a better way</em>. They persevered for a few months until the first release, using the new tooling and ways of working, went to the production environment, then the next, and so on. At this point, there was no turning back as too much had changed.</p>
<p>As you can no doubt appreciate, it took courage from all parts of the business to make this decision. There was no plan B and if it hadn't worked they had no way to release their software. Knowing this fact, the business was determined to get the new CD and DevOps ways of working embedded and established.</p>
<p>This could be classed as an extreme case, but nonetheless it goes to show that courage and determination are sometimes very much needed; if there's a will there's a way.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Before we move away from the planning stage, there are still a couple of things you should be aware of as you prepare to embark on your new adventure: where to seek help and ensuring you and the wider business are aware of the costs involved with implementing and adopting CD and DevOps. We'll cover costs first.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Implementing CD and DevOps will ultimately save the business quite a lot of money; that is a very simple and obvious fact. The effort required to release software will be dramatically reduced, the resources required will be miniscule when compared to large <em>big bang</em> releases, the time to market will be vastly reduced, the quality will be vastly increased, and the cost of doing business (that is, volume of bug fixes required, support for system downtime, fines for not meeting SLAs, and so on) will be negligible. That said, implementing CD and DevOps does not come for free. There are costs involved and the business needs to be aware.</p>
<p>Let's break these down:</p>
<ul>
<li>A dedicated team assigned to the CD and DevOps project</li>
<li>Changes to business process documentation and/or business process maps</li>
<li>Changes to standard operating procedures</li>
<li>Changes to hosting (on the assumption there is a move to virtual/cloud infrastructure)</li>
<li>Tweaks to change management systems to allow for quicker and more lightweight operations</li>
<li>Internal PR and marketing materials</li>
<li>Enlisting the help from external specialists</li>
<li>Things may slow down at the start as new ways of working become the norm</li>
</ul>
<p>These costs should not be extortionate; however, they are costs that need to be taken into account and planned for. As with any project—especially one as far reaching as CD and DevOps adoption—there will always be certain costs. If the business is aware of this from the outset, then the chance of it scuppering the project later down the line can be minimized.</p>
<p>There may be some costs that are indirectly caused by the project. You may have some people who cannot accept the changes and simply decide to move on; there will be costs to replace them (or not, as the case may be). As previously stated at the beginning of the transition from big bang releases, you may well slow down to get quicker. If you have contractual deadlines to meet during this period, it may be prudent to renegotiate them.</p>
<p>Those actively involved in the CD and DevOps adoption will know your business better than anyone—especially after the elephant exposure—so you may have better ideas related to costs. Just make sure you do not ignore them.</p>
<p>Let's now focus on where you can get help and advice should you need it.</p>

<p>Before you take the plunge and change the entire way your business operates, it may be a good idea to do some research and/or reach out to others who meet one of the following descriptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have been through this transition a few times and have the battle scars to prove it</li>
<li>Are in the same boat as you</li>
<li>Specialize in wide-reaching agile business change</li>
<li>Are recognized as experts in the field of both CD and DevOps</li>
</ul>
<p>There is an ever-growing number of people around the globe who have experience in implementing (and even defining) CD and DevOps. Some are experts in the field and focus on this as their full-time jobs; some are simply members of the growing community who have seen the light and selflessly want to help others realize the benefits they have witnessed and experienced.</p>
<p>To reiterate, implementing CD and DevOps is no picnic and sometimes being at the forefront can be a lonely place. Do not feel like you should struggle alone. There are some valuable reference materials available (this book being one of those I would hope) and more importantly there are a good number of communities—online and face to face meet-ups—that you can join to help you. You never know, your story and input may be an inspiration for others, so in true CD and DevOps style, break down the barriers and enjoy open and honest dialogue. I'll include a list of some of the reference materials and contacts in <a href="b212024b-5ba5-4f01-b76d-a8367c6ec41c.xhtml">Appendix A</a>, <em>Some Useful Info</em>.</p>

<p>So, what have we covered in this chapter? We have learned that without defining our goal and vision, it's pretty difficult to clarify and communicate what CD and DevOps adoption will mean, and what business value they will bring. Staying with communication, we have learned that without having a common standard in relation to terms, language, and vocabulary, it will be difficult to collaborate across the organization. In terms of who is impacted by CD and DevOps, we have covered the fact that this is a wide-reaching business change and not localized to the traditional IT organization. Just like any business change, CD and DevOps adoption will not be free; there will be cost (<span>some obvious, some not so obvious)</span> and you need to take that into account. Lastly, you are not alone; there are a large number of people, teams, and businesses around the globe who have already been through this adoption and came out the other side in a much better position.</p>
<p>Let's assume at this point that you have followed this advice and now have a team, a plan, executive backing and sponsorship, defined ways to communicate, some budget, and some support from battle-weary experts. You're now ready to move to the next stage—implementing <span>the goal and vision, which is what we'll be covering in the next couple of chapters. We'll start by looking at some of the proven approaches, tools, and techniques that will help you move forward. </span></p>
