    off the mark, it might just be so. If you're lucky enough to have PR or marketing

    a majority of the problems highlighted during their elephant exposure. These deliverables

    or confusion of what the deliverables are. This may sound a little alarming, but
    projects can fail simply because one person expects something, but another person
    misunderstands or misinterprets and delivers something else. It's not normally
    down to ignorance; it's normally due to both sides interpreting the same thing
    in different ways.

  zh: 一个小小的、完全可以避免的事情可能会毁掉任何一个项目，那就是对交付物的误解或混淆。听起来可能有些令人担忧，但项目失败往往仅仅因为一个人期望的是某个东西，而另一个人误解或误读了这个需求，交付了完全不同的东西。这通常并非因为无知，通常是因为双方对同一个事情的理解方式不同。
- en: For example, let's look at something relatively innocuous; the word release.
    To a project manager or a release manager, this could represent a bundle of software
    changes, which need to be tested and put live within a schedule or program of
    work. This will normally entail detailed project plans, close coordination with
    all departments inside and outside of the product delivery function and lots of
    meetings, paperwork, and late nights. To a developer working in an agile way,
    a *release* could be a one-line code change, which could go live soon after they
    have completed coding and ran the automate tests. As you can see, one simple word
    can be perceived as something that will take a considerable amount of work by
    one member of a product delivery team member and perceived as something simple
    that just happens on a daily basis. These perceptions can cause lots of unforeseen
    and wasteful problems.

  zh: 例如，让我们来看一个相对无害的词语：发布（release）。对项目经理或发布经理来说，这可能代表一系列软件更改，需要在计划或工作程序内进行测试并上线。这通常涉及详细的项目计划、与产品交付职能内外的各个部门的紧密协调，以及大量的会议、文书工作和加班。对一个以敏捷方式工作的开发人员来说，*发布*
    可能只是一次简单的代码更改，可能在他们完成编码并运行自动化测试后不久就会上线。如你所见，同一个简单的词在产品交付团队的一个成员眼里可能代表着需要大量工作的内容，而在另一个人眼中却是每天都会发生的简单事情。这些不同的理解会导致许多无法预见的浪费问题。
- en: There can also be a bit of a problem when you start to examine all of the different
    words, terminology, and TLAs (three-letter acronyms) that we all use within product
    delivery and IT as a whole. We therefore need to be mindful of the target audiences
    we are communicating to and with to ensure they easily understand the message
    they are given. Again, the KISS method works well here. You don't necessarily
    have to go down to the lowest common denominator; that may be very hard to do
    (you could end up writing an entire book) and could make matters worse. Try to
    strike a balance. If some of the target audience don't easily understand, then
    get someone who does understand to talk with them and explain; this will help
    bridge the gaps and also form good working relationships.

    experience/knowledge of CD and DevOps will actually understand the value of both/either
    and know (or at least have a pretty good idea) how it should be adopted. This
    is very true, however there are drawbacks—which we'll cover shortly. The other
    school suggests that this is a bad idea as it's not really that far removed from
    any other business change project, therefore can be managed through close collaboration
    and coordination without specialist knowledge. In truth, both schools are correct
    and also incorrect at the same time.

  zh: 关于是否需要专门且全力投入的团队来监督CD和DevOps的采纳，存在几种不同的观点。一种观点认为这是必要且合乎逻辑的举措，因为只有那些对CD和DevOps感兴趣或具备相关经验/知识的人，才能真正理解这两者的价值，并且知道（或者至少有比较清晰的想法）应该如何进行采纳。这一点是非常正确的，但也存在缺点——我们稍后会讨论。另一种观点则认为这是一个不好的主意，因为这与其他业务变革项目并没有太大的区别，因此可以通过紧密合作和协调来管理，而不需要专业知识。事实上，这两种观点都是对的，同时也都是错的。
- en: 'What it boils down to is this: if a dedicated team can get the adoption moving
    quickly, efficiently, and effectively then go for it, as long as they don''t end
    up doing everything themselves in isolation and are therefore seen as the CD and
    DevOps team who just implement technical things and don''t need/work with anyone
    else. As I''ve stated previously, just having a CD and/or DevOps team in your
    organization does not mean you have adopted CD and DevOps, it''s far more complex
    than that. Like any successful business change project, a dedicated team should
    be there to help steer, guide, mentor, and coach the like-minded individuals (not
    just Dev and Ops) involved to collaborate and contribute while at the same time
    actively contributing themselves and focused on moving the adoption along. The
    sometimes overused business bingo term here is enablers or agents for change.'

  zh: 归根结底，问题是这样的：如果一个专门的团队能够快速、高效、有效地推动采纳进程，那就去做吧，只要他们不会把所有事情都自己做，孤立地工作，并因此被视为仅仅执行技术任务的CD和DevOps团队，而不需要与其他人合作。正如我之前所说，仅仅拥有一个CD和/或DevOps团队并不意味着你已经采纳了CD和DevOps，情况比这要复杂得多。像任何成功的业务变革项目一样，专门的团队应该帮助引导、指导、辅导并支持那些志同道合的人（不仅仅是开发和运维），使他们能够合作和贡献，同时自己也要积极参与，专注于推动采纳的进程。这里常常被过度使用的商业术语是“赋能者”或“变革推动者”。
- en: If you prefer to forgo a dedicated team and simply run the adoption as a business
    change project bringing in skills and individuals as when required, then you should
    at least need have someone(s) heavily involved who has a knowledge and/or experience
    of what CD and DevOps adoption actually means and can ensure the goal and vision
    are realized—without that, things may go off the rails somewhat. Something to
    also consider is whether or not the same sense of ownership and close collaboration
    will come out of a collection of individuals who occasionally work together vs
    a dedicated team who share a common goal and vision.

    of making themselves redundant. I don't mean they will lose their jobs, what I
    mean is that the dedicated team should be transient and once the CD and DevOps
    adoption has taken hold the team can be disbanded with little/no fuss and go back

  zh: 理解成本
- en: Implementing CD and DevOps will ultimately save the business quite a lot of
    money; that is a very simple and obvious fact. The effort required to release
    software will be dramatically reduced, the resources required will be miniscule
    when compared to large *big bang* releases, the time to market will be vastly
    reduced, the quality will be vastly increased, and the cost of doing business
    (that is, volume of bug fixes required, support for system downtime, fines for
    not meeting SLAs, and so on) will be negligible. That said, implementing CD and
    DevOps does not come for free. There are costs involved and the business needs
    to be aware.

  zh: 实施CD和DevOps最终将为企业节省大量资金；这是一个非常简单且明显的事实。发布软件所需的努力将大大减少，与大型*大爆炸*发布相比，所需资源将微乎其微，市场推出时间将大幅缩短，质量将大大提高，做生意的成本（即所需修复的错误数量、系统停机支持、未达到SLA的罚款等）将几乎可以忽略不计。也就是说，实施CD和DevOps并非没有成本。确实需要成本，企业需要意识到这一点。

- en: These costs should not be extortionate; however, they are costs that need to
    be taken into account and planned for. As with any project—especially one as far
    reaching as CD and DevOps adoption—there will always be certain costs. If the
    business is aware of this from the outset, then the chance of it scuppering the
    project later down the line can be minimized.

  zh: 这些成本不应是过高的；然而，它们是需要考虑并计划的成本。像任何项目一样——尤其是像CD和DevOps推广这样影响深远的项目——总会有一些成本。如果从一开始，业务就已经意识到这一点，那么以后项目失败的可能性就可以最小化。
- en: There may be some costs that are indirectly caused by the project. You may have
    some people who cannot accept the changes and simply decide to move on; there
    will be costs to replace them (or not, as the case may be). As previously stated
    at the beginning of the transition from big bang releases, you may well slow down
    to get quicker. If you have contractual deadlines to meet during this period,
    it may be prudent to renegotiate them.

  zh: 可能会有一些间接由项目引起的成本。你可能会有一些人无法接受这些变化，最终选择离开；这时需要承担替换他们的成本（或者可能不需要，视情况而定）。正如在“大爆炸”发布转型初期所说，你可能会为了更快的速度而放慢进度。如果在此期间有合同截止日期需要遵守，或许需要重新谈判这些截止日期。

  zh: 总结
- en: So, what have we covered in this chapter? We have learned that without defining
    our goal and vision, it's pretty difficult to clarify and communicate what CD
    and DevOps adoption will mean, and what business value they will bring. Staying
    with communication, we have learned that without having a common standard in relation
    to terms, language, and vocabulary, it will be difficult to collaborate across
    the organization. In terms of who is impacted by CD and DevOps, we have covered
    the fact that this is a wide-reaching business change and not localized to the
    traditional IT organization. Just like any business change, CD and DevOps adoption
    will not be free; there will be cost (some obvious, some not so obvious) and you
    need to take that into account. Lastly, you are not alone; there are a large number
    of people, teams, and businesses around the globe who have already been through
    this adoption and came out the other side in a much better position.

  zh: 那么，我们在本章中讲了什么？我们了解到，如果没有定义目标和愿景，就很难澄清和沟通CD和DevOps的采用意味着什么，以及它们将带来什么商业价值。继续沟通的话题，我们了解到，如果没有在术语、语言和词汇方面达成共识，跨组织协作将变得非常困难。至于谁会受到CD和DevOps的影响，我们已经提到这是一项广泛的商业变革，而不仅限于传统的IT组织。就像任何商业变革一样，CD和DevOps的采用不会是免费的；它将会有成本（有些是显而易见的，有些则不那么明显），你需要考虑到这一点。最后，你并不孤单；全球有大量的人、团队和企业已经经历了这一过程，并且从中获得了显著的进步。

    to the next stage—implementing the goal and vision, which is what we'll be covering
    in the next couple of chapters. We'll start by looking at some of the proven approaches,
    tools, and techniques that will help you move forward.
