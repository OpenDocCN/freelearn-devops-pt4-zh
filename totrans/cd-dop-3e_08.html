<p>Up until this point we have been on a journey, from surfacing the issues that caused the business pains through defining the goal and vision to remove them, addressing cultural, environmental, and technical impediments, adopting much-needed tools and techniques, overcoming hurdles, to measuring success.</p>
<p>Let's wind the clock forward and presume at this point that all of the advice in the preceding chapters and pages has helped—along with some more specialist advice, complimentary publications, and maybe some assistance<span>—</span>and that you have implemented the necessary tools and process changes. Let's also presume that the adoption of CD and DevOps is in full swing throughout your organization.</p>
<p>If you're reading this at the start of your journey, then I would ask you to continue reading and use your imagination to visualize how things could be with CD and DevOps adoption under your belt.</p>
<p>If all has gone to plan, the business has started to see the benefits and reap the rewards in terms of the ability to deliver quality features to the market far sooner that they could previously. On the face of it, you're almost done achieving your goal and realizing your vision, but<span>—</span>and it's a very important but<span>—</span>this is not the end.</p>
<p>The journey you have all been on has been a long one, and just like the five-year-old who has been sitting in the back of the car on the long road trip to grandma's house, you will now have people within your organization repeatedly asking things such as are we there yet? How much longer? When do we stop spending money on this DevOps thing? And I need to pee! Okay, maybe not so much the last one, but I think you get the point. This is as good a time as any to pause for a moment and take stock of where you are.</p>

<p>Yes, you have come a long way; yes, things are going much more smoothly; yes, the organization is working more closely together; yes, the Dev and Ops divide is less of a chasm and more of a small crack in the ground; and yes you have almost completed what you set out to do. What you have done is reduce the process of delivering software from something complex, painful and cumbersome to something as simple as the following:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 90px" class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">          <img src="assets/fd75282d-4814-4dcb-9d14-0aae8e713d24.png" style=""/></div>
<p>The problems you originally set out to address revolved around the waste within the process of delivering software, the long-winded and pointless processes, the political posturing, and more specifically, the waste that comes from large, infrequent releases. Adopting CD and DevOps has helped you overcome (most of) these problems.</p>
<p>As a result, you will now start to hear comments such as we can deploy quickly, so we must have implemented CD, or our developers and operations people are working closely together, so we must have implemented DevOps.</p>
<p>Some would suggest that once you start to hear this, it must mean that you have indeed completed what you set out to do. In some respects, this is true; however, in reality, this is far from the truth.</p>
<p>What these comments do illustrate is the fact that the major issues highlighted at the beginning of the journey have now started to become dim and distant memories. The business has grown to accept CD and DevOps as the way we do things around here, and has at last started to grasp their meaning<span>, </span>which is good. However, there's still work to be done and problems to solve; albeit different work and different problems. As you did at the beginning of the journey, it is again time to inspect and ascertain what problems are important now and adapt to solve them. To explain this, we have to go off on a bit of a tangent.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Let's compare your software-release process to a flowing river (I did say it was a bit of a tangent):</p>
<ul>
<li>At the very beginning, many small streams flowed downhill and converged into a river. This river flowed along, but the progress was impeded by a series of locks and a massive manmade dam:</li>
</ul>
<div style="padding-left: 90px"><img src="assets/aac105bd-5151-4da6-a7f5-4453182a34b4.png" style=""/></div>
<ul>
<li>The river then backed up and started to form a reservoir.</li>
<li>Every few months, the sluice gates were opened and the water flowed freely, but this was normally a short-lived and frantic rush.</li>
<li>As you identified and started to remove the manmade obstacles, the flow started to become more even, but it was still hindered by some very large boulders further downstream:</li>
</ul>
<div style="padding-left: 120px"><img src="assets/b0c887be-37f3-47c7-bb59-587d608c0eb0.png" style=""/></div>
<ul>
<li>You then set about systematically removing these boulders one by one, which again increased the flow; this, in turn, started to become consistent, predictable, and manageable.</li>
<li>As a consequence of removing the obstacles to increase the flow, the water level starts to drop and small pebbles start to appear and create eddies, which restrict the flow to a small degree, but not enough to halt it:</li>
</ul>
<div style="padding-left: 90px"><img src="assets/fa6a467e-5ec8-4d6f-8e62-b9f480820137.png" style=""/></div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ul>
<li>The flow goes on increasing, the water level goes on decreasing, and it soon becomes obvious that the pebbles were actually the tips of yet more boulders hidden in the depths of the river.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what's this got to do with your adoption of CD and DevOps? Quite a lot if you stop to think about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before you started, you had many streams of work, all converging into one big and complicated release<span>—</span>these were the streams into the river that backed up into the reservoir.</li>
<li>At the beginning of your journey, you had a pretty good idea of what the major issues and problems were. These were pretty obvious to all and were causing the most pain<span>—</span>these were the locks and dams.</li>
<li>You removed these obstacles and the flow started to be more consistent, but it was being hindered by the boulders<span>—</span>these are the lack of engineering best practices, bad culture and behaviors, the lack of an open and honest environment, and so on.</li>
<li>You systematically addressed and removed each of the boulders and started to get a good, consistent flow, but new unforeseen issues start to pop up and impede your progress<span>—</span>these are the pebbles that turn out to be more boulders under the waterline.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you cast your mind back, your original goal and vision was focused on the major issues highlighted during the elephant exposure inspect stage (the manmade locks and dams)<span>—</span>the things you <em>knew</em> were problems when you started out. As you systematically worked to address these, your delivering-software river started to flow more freely and you and the wider business started to see some positive and interesting results. Over time, hurdles (the boulders) that were not as obvious or important became more visible and a cause for concern. You then changed focus to remove these, which, in turn, improved the overall flow once again.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox"><span class="IntenseQuoteChar">Due to the nature of improvement, the more efficient and effective you make a process, the more the small niggling issues (pebbles) become hurdles (boulders). This is nothing specific to CD, DevOps, or IT; this is just something that happens.</span></div>
<p>This is by no means all doom and gloom, nor something to be concerned about. You and the business have faced bigger challenges, and you now have a level of organizational maturity that means you can deal with these new boulders with ease. That's a sign of being successful.</p>

<p>Humans are very fickle beings. As businesses are mostly staffed by humans, they are also fickle. A moment of success soon passes and fades into the collective memory, and problems that were not problems a few weeks/months ago start to become the talk of the town, boardroom, water cooler, or washroom. Another problem with success is that this becomes the baseline, which means that even the smallest of problems can start to become a major issue relatively quickly. These problems can be relatively simple things, such as:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 90px" class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f951c854-65ec-46e9-b17d-b840adb4a44c.png" style=""/></div>
<div class="packt_figref"><span>As adoption matures, relatively small issues can become the new problems</span></div>
<p>In the space of a few months, the vast majority of the team members originally working within the constraints of big release cycles<span>—</span>which took many weeks or months to pull together, test, and push into the production environment<span>—</span>have all but forgotten, dark old days and are now finding new things to worry and grumble about. This is nothing unusual; it happens within every project, be it a major business change project or a relatively simple software-delivery project. It's nothing unusual, but if you think about it, it is a positive problem to have.</p>
<p>Up until recently, the engineering teams were severely restricted and unable to truly innovate, experiment, or flex their engineering muscles due to the bureaucracy, complexity, and constraints of the big release process. They no longer have to worry about the process of releasing software, as this has become an everyday background noise that just happens over and over again without the need for much effort<span>—</span>mainly due to the excellent work you have all done.</p>
<p>The seemingly small problems that are now being raised would have been, in the dark days, simple annoyances that would have been dismissed or ignored as low priority. They were pebbles deep under the waterline. Now, they are something real and boulder-shaped, and they need to be addressed; otherwise, there is a risk that things will slow down and the days will again become darker.</p>
<p>You and the wider business may at this point start asking the following types of question (I have included my responses as well, if that helps):</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 100%" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 46.521%">

</td>
<td style="width: 52.479%">
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
</td>

<td style="width: 46.521%">
<p>Does the fact that new problems have surfaced mean that your original goal has not been met and you have failed?</p>
</td>
<td style="width: 52.479%">
<p>No, it doesn't! It just means that the landscape has changed.</p>
</td>

<td style="width: 46.521%">
<p>Was it all a waste of time, as we seem to have as many problems as we had to begin with?</p>
</td>
<td style="width: 52.479%">
<p>No. The problems you encountered previously<span>—</span>and were exposed to, such as the elephant way back when<span>—</span>were much larger, far-reaching, and for all intents and purposes ignored, or at least accepted. These new problems are insignificant in direct comparison<span>—e</span>specially in terms of cost to the business<span>—</span>and are out in the open for all to see.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 46.521%">
<p>How much more money do we need to spend?</p>
</td>
<td style="width: 52.479%">
<p>That depends on the size and relative priority of the new problems. However, as CD and DevOps are now simply part of the standard SDLC, you should be investing as you would in any other part of your business processes and tools.</p>
</td>

<td style="width: 46.521%">
<p>Did we miss something?</p>

<td style="width: 52.479%">
<p>No, most of the <em>new</em> problems were unforeseen and/or simple niggles at the beginning of the journey.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td style="width: 46.521%">
<p>Does this mean you need to change the goal, create a new plan, and start all over again?</p>

<p>Not necessarily. What you now need is some PDCA.</p>

<p class="mce-root"><span>So, what exactly is PDCA? Let's find out.</span></p>

<p>There are a number of variations of this acronym; however, the most widely used one is <strong>Plan</strong>, <strong>Do</strong>, <strong>Check</strong>, and <strong>Adjust</strong>. You might also find PDCA being referred to as the Deming circle or the Shewhart cycle. Whatever definition you prefer, the idea behind the PDCA approach is quite simple; it is a framework and approach that you can use for continuous and iterative improvement. The following simple diagram should help explain this:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 150px" class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">           <img src="assets/8bfba0da-c5f1-45c8-923c-0b72bccf751b.png" style=""/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The iterative PDCA process</div>
<p>Simply put, this approach is an expansion of the inspect-and-adapt approaches that have been mentioned many times previously<span>—</span>although, if truth be told, it's been around for much longer. The concept is pretty easy to grasp and follow, and it can be applied to almost every aspect of your CD and DevOps adoption. Let's look at an example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan</strong>: You realize that your current process to deliver software is broken and decide that you need to find out why by running workshops to map out the entire process</li>
<li><strong>Do</strong>: You run the workshops and capture input and data from across the business</li>
<li><strong>Check</strong>: You analyze the output to ascertain whether the data provided gives you an insight into where the pain points are within your process</li>
<li><strong>Adjust</strong>: You highlight some areas of waste and agree on corrective actions</li>
<li><strong>Plan</strong>: You set a goal and pull together a plan of attack to address the major pain points</li>
<li><strong>Do</strong>: You execute against this plan</li>
<li><strong>Check</strong>: You review the progress against the goal</li>
<li><strong>Adjust</strong>: You make tweaks to the approach as more information and unforeseen hurdles are unearthed</li>
<li><strong>Plan</strong>: You realign the plan to ensure that the goal is still achievable, given the new information you have gathered</li>
<li><strong>Do</strong>: I think you can fill the rest in yourself</li>
</ul>
<p>As with most of the tools and techniques covered in this book, using the PDCA approach over any other is your call; however, it is a well-proven and well-recognized framework to use<span>—e</span>specially when you're looking at implementing something that is as wide-reaching and business-changing as CD and DevOps<span>—</span>so I would suggest you don't simply dismiss it.</p>
<p>If you took heed of the importance of collecting data and metrics, as covered in <a href="390f69c0-7f66-41a7-93a6-ee5c1bc8733a.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <span><em>Vital Measurements</em>, </span>you should now have a good collection of data to call upon for the Check stage of PDCA, which will make the Adjust stage easier to define. You may even spot issues that were not as obvious. For example, if you see cycle times spiking on regular occasions (Check) that also correspond with unplanned downtime of the QA environment, which in turn is caused by the storage filling up, then someone should look into why this is from happening and stop it happening (adjust)<span>—</span>which might be as simple as (plan)ning to add more storage (Do).</p>
<p>One major advantage of PDCA is that it has the luxury of being simple to understand at all levels of the business, and it is also highly adaptable<span>—</span>for example, this book has been developed using the self-same approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>I planned out the overall structure and content of the book as whole</li>
<li>I then documented this as a proposal</li>
<li>I passed this to the publisher to check and provide feedback</li>
<li>I assessed the feedback and made adjustments to the overall plan</li>
<li>I started to plan out chapter one</li>
<li>I wrote chapter one</li>
<li>My editor reviewed it and provided feedback</li>
<li>I adjusted chapter one</li>
<li>I planned out chapter two<span>—</span>I think you get the rather labored point</li>
</ul>
<p>If PDCA isn't your preferred framework or approach, I encourage you to do some research before any action is taken. I specifically said any action is taken rather than you act, as you should now take a step back and take stock of where <em>you</em> are and what <em>you</em> need to do next.</p>

<p>After many long hours, days, and months, the business has become used to the changes you and those working alongside you have all spent many long hours, days, and months implementing. The fickle business is now experiencing and reporting new issues that they feel are important. The question is, who should address these newfound challenges? The answer is quite simple<span>—</span>not <em>you</em> or those who have been working alongside <em>you</em> spearheading the adoption of CD and DevOps.</p>
<p>You have helped embed the new collaborative ways of working, helped bridge the gap between Dev and Ops, helped implement new tools and optimized processes, drank lots of coffee, and had little sleep. You have done your bit, and it's now time for those you have been helping to take off the training wheels, step up, and take the reins (to mix quite a few metaphors):</p>
<div style="padding-left: 150px"><img src="assets/cb17d757-d59b-42e1-8d74-aa94757c77b1.png" style=""/></div>
<div class="packt_figref"><span>The training wheels are no longer needed</span></div>
<p>Way back in <a href="03ef279d-c51d-4e35-a137-701636c17d5f.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em><span>Understanding Your Current Pain Points</span></em>, we looked at how to identify the problems and issues the business faced. We called this the elephant in the room. You helped the wider business understand and learn how to use retrospection and other tools to look back and plan forward, and taught them how open, honest, and courageous dialogue would help to find the correct path. As stated a few times, the <em>new</em> issues and problems are just that: <em>new</em>.</p>
<p>These new issues and problems do need to be addressed, but if you compare where the business was at the start of the journey to where it is now in terms of organization maturity, there is one major and very important difference: the business now has the tools and capabilities to identify the new elephant-shaped boulders very quickly, and now has the tools, knowledge, confidence, experience, and expertise to remove them quickly and painlessly on their own. If you don't believe me, re-run the CD and DevOps evolutionary scale quiz from <a href="4ca6da75-a952-4ea8-9137-19cbc1d21012.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <span><em>The Evolution of Software Delivery</em>, </span>and see how the business scores now compared to many months ago.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>As discussed previously, you have pretty much reached the original goal (or as near as, damn it), so your swan song is to help others help themselves. It was fun while it lasted, but all good things must come to an end, so now is a good time to consider your exit strategy. This isn't to say that you should run away, hide, and not be involved at all; it just means that to fully encourage the fledgling ways of working, you need to be the responsible parent and let the kids grow up and learn by themselves.</p>
<p>Your focus should now change from driving the adoption (doing) to coaching and guiding the continuation (leading). Those who were the innovators of the adoption of CD and DevOps<span>—</span>yourself included<span>—</span>should now start encouraging the innovators and followers who benefited from the adoption to step into the light and take responsibility for their own boulders. This will not happen overnight, but you need to be pretty clear on your intentions so that people understand that you are handing over the baton. Simple things such as handing over the organization of regular CD and DevOps meetings to someone else or booking some time off when the next big tooling upgrade is scheduled to take place would suffice. The old "out of sight, out of mind" adage can be a useful thing when you need it.</p>
<p>Just like a good parent, you have set up a safe environment for growth and self-discovery, and therefore, you should only need a light touch, a bit of guiding here, some advice there, and the odd prod in the right direction.</p>
<p>One major part of this newfound parental leadership role is to look again at the wider and less tangible areas of CD and DevOps to ensure complacency doesn't set in.</p>

<p>So, you've done a lot and progressed further, and the business and those working within it are all the better for it. This is a good thing<span>—</span>you and all those involved should be very proud of what has been achieved. However, this is no reason for the business to rest on its laurels; it might be tempting, but there are still things that need to be kept in check.</p>
<p>Previously, I highlighted that there would be new problems and issues that will surface from below the waterline that will keep the new generation of innovators and followers busy. With you and the previous generation coaching and guiding them, they'll be fine and will solve these new challenges. Alongside this will come complacency as the new becomes the normal. You have helped the business evolve, but you have to be very mindful of the fact that the business can start to devolve just as easily and quickly if there seems to be a vacuum and complacency seeps in to fill it.</p>
<div class="packt_quote">Horror vacui (more commonly known as 'Nature abhors a vacuum') - Aristotle</div>
<p>As with any far-reaching project or business change, if the frantic rate of change starts to peter off or be seen to stop, things will start to stagnate and old ingrained habits will start to resurface. In this environment, the <em>laggards</em> might start to become vocal again, and the followers might start to listen to them. You will have actively and notably shifted your position from doer to facilitator and influencer; as such, your role will be to make sure things are running smoothly and to keep your eyes and ears open for new threats. You have built up a good network, so start using this to get some early warning.</p>
<p>When compared to what you have achieved, this might seem simple, but it can be much harder at times; you're used to being actively involved in driving others and doing stuff yourself, and now have to keep your distance and watch others doing stuff that you are still passionate about. It's sometimes harder, but just as rewarding. Think of it as taking the next step in your personal evolution. As such, you are in a good position to look beyond the initial goal to see whether there are opportunities to assist in a wider capacity.</p>

<p>Adopting CD and DevOps is a long and hard journey. If you think it's not, you are deluded. You'll circumvent elephant-filled rivers and other unforeseen challenges as you near the journey's end. Parental guidance is needed to steer the business in the right direction while you plan how to step out of the limelight and make room for those who have benefited from the achievements you have collectively made. New problems will emerge and threaten the adoption progress; however, the business is wiser and should now have the tools, maturity, and experience to cope. Keeping an eye on things is worthwhile and admirable however there's much bigger and better things to focus your attention on. In <a href="0069e24c-33a3-410a-a2b1-f86895bb646f.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Expanding Your Opportunity Horizon</em>, we'll be looking at some examples of these bigger and better opportunities that come from a mature CD and DevOps culture.</p>
