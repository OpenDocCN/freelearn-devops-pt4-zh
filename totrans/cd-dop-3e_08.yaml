    of PDCA, which will make the Adjust stage easier to define. You may even spot
    issues that were not as obvious. For example, if you see cycle times spiking on
    regular occasions (Check) that also correspond with unplanned downtime of the
    QA environment, which in turn is caused by the storage filling up, then someone
    should look into why this is from happening and stop it happening (adjust)—which

    good time to consider your exit strategy. This isn't to say that you should run

    kids grow up and learn by themselves.

- en: Your focus should now change from driving the adoption (doing) to coaching and
    guiding the continuation (leading). Those who were the innovators of the adoption
    of CD and DevOps—yourself included—should now start encouraging the innovators
    and followers who benefited from the adoption to step into the light and take
    responsibility for their own boulders. This will not happen overnight, but you
    need to be pretty clear on your intentions so that people understand that you
    are handing over the baton. Simple things such as handing over the organization
    of regular CD and DevOps meetings to someone else or booking some time off when
    the next big tooling upgrade is scheduled to take place would suffice. The old
    "out of sight, out of mind" adage can be a useful thing when you need it.

- en: Adopting CD and DevOps is a long and hard journey. If you think it's not, you
    are deluded. You'll circumvent elephant-filled rivers and other unforeseen challenges
    as you near the journey's end. Parental guidance is needed to steer the business
    in the right direction while you plan how to step out of the limelight and make
    room for those who have benefited from the achievements you have collectively
    made. New problems will emerge and threaten the adoption progress; however, the
    business is wiser and should now have the tools, maturity, and experience to cope.
    Keeping an eye on things is worthwhile and admirable however there's much bigger
    and better things to focus your attention on. In [Chapter 9](0069e24c-33a3-410a-a2b1-f86895bb646f.xhtml),
