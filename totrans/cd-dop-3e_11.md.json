["```\n/**\n* This is a comment because I've been told to include comments in my\n* code\n* Some sort of code analysis has been implemented and I need to\n* include comments to ensure that my code is not highlighted as poor\n* quality.\n*\n* I'm not too sure what the percentage of comments vs code is\n* required but if I include lots of this kind of thing the tool will\n* ignore my code and I can get on with my day job\n*\n* In fact this is pretty much a waste of time as whoever is reading\n* this should be looking at the code rather than reading comments.\n* If you don't understand the code then maybe you shouldn't be trying\n* to change it?!?\n*/\n```"]
