    I realized that a single book could only scratch the surface. Kubernetes is vast,
    and no single book can envelop even all the core components. If we add community
    projects, the scope becomes even more extensive. Then we need to include hosting
    vendors and different ways to set up and manage Kubernetes. That would inevitably
    lead us to third-party solutions like OpenShift, Rancher, and DockerEE, to name
    a few. It doesn’t end there. We’d need to explore other types of community and
    third-party additions like those related to networking and storage. And don’t
    forget the processes like, for example, continuous delivery and deployment. All
    those things could not be explored in a single book so *The DevOps 2.3 Toolkit:
    Kubernetes* ended up being an introduction to Kubernetes. It can serve as the
    base for exploring everything else.'

- en: 'The moment I published the last chapter of [The DevOps 2.3 Toolkit: Kubernetes](https://amzn.to/2GvzDjy),
    I started working on the next material. A lot of ideas and tryouts came out of
    it. It took me a while until the subject and the form of the forthcoming book
    materialized. After a lot of consultation with the readers of the previous book,
    the decision was made to explore continuous delivery and deployment processes
    in a Kubernetes cluster. The high-level scope of the book you are reading right
    now was born.'
