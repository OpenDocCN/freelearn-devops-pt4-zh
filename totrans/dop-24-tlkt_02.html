<p class="calibre3">This book explores continuous deployment to a Kubernetes cluster. It uses a wide range of Kubernetes platforms and provides instructions how to develop a pipeline on few of the most commonly used CI/CD tools.</p>

<p class="calibre3">This book is not your first contact with Kubernetes. I am assuming that you are already proficient with Deployments, ReplicaSets, Pods, Ingress, Services, PersistentVolumes, PersistentVolumeClaims, Namespaces and a few other things. This book assumes that we do not need to go through the basic stuff. At least, not through all of it. The book assumes a certain level of Kubernetes knowledge and hands-on experience. If that’s not the case, what follows might be too confusing and advanced. Please read <a href="https://amzn.to/2GvzDjy">The DevOps 2.3 Toolkit: Kubernetes</a> first, or consult the Kubernetes documentation. Come back once you’re done and once you think you can claim that you understand at least basic Kubernetes concepts and resource types.</p>
