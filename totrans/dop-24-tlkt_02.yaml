- en: 'This book is not your first contact with Kubernetes. I am assuming that you
    are already proficient with Deployments, ReplicaSets, Pods, Ingress, Services,
    PersistentVolumes, PersistentVolumeClaims, Namespaces and a few other things.
    This book assumes that we do not need to go through the basic stuff. At least,
    not through all of it. The book assumes a certain level of Kubernetes knowledge
    and hands-on experience. If that’s not the case, what follows might be too confusing
    and advanced. Please read [The DevOps 2.3 Toolkit: Kubernetes](https://amzn.to/2GvzDjy)
    first, or consult the Kubernetes documentation. Come back once you’re done and
    once you think you can claim that you understand at least basic Kubernetes concepts
    and resource types.'
