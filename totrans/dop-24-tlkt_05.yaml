- en: Each chapter will assume that you have a working Kubernetes cluster. It doesn’t
    matter whether that’s a single-node cluster running locally or a fully operational
    production-like cluster. What matters is that you have (at least) one.

- en: 'We won’t go into details how to create a Kubernetes cluster. I’m sure that
    you already know how to do that and that you have `kubectl` installed on your
    laptop. If that’s not the case, you might want to read [Appendix A: Installing
    kubectl and Creating A Cluster With minikube](part0017.html#appendix-a). While
    minikube is great for running a local single-node Kubernetes cluster, you’ll probably
    want to try some of the ideas in a more production-like cluster. I hope that you
    already have a “real” Kubernetes cluster running in AWS, GKE, DigitalOcean, on-prem,
    or somewhere else. If you don’t, and you don’t know how to create one, please
    read *[Appendix B: Using Kubernetes Operations (kops)](part0018.html#appendix-b)*.
    It’ll give you just enough information you need to prepare, create, and destroy
    a cluster.'

- en: Even though *[Appendix A](part0017.html#appendix-a)* and [Appendix B](part0018.html#appendix-b)
    explain how to create a Kubernetes cluster locally and in AWS, you do not need
    to limit yourself to minikube locally and kops in AWS. I did my best to provide
    instructions on some of the most commonly used flavors of Kubernetes clusters.

    combinations. When that is not the case, you’ll see a note explaining what should
    be done to accomplish the same result in your favorite Kubernetes and hosting
    flavor. Even if you use something else, you should have no problems adapting the
    commands and specifications to comply with your platform.

- en: Each chapter will contain a short list of requirements that your Kubernetes
    cluster will need to meet. If you are unsure about some of the requirements, I
    prepared a few Gists with the commands I used to create them. Since each chapter
    might need different cluster components and sizes, the Gists used for setting
    up a cluster might differ from one chapter to another. Please use them as guidelines,
    not necessarily as the exact commands you should execute. After all, the book
    assumes that you already have some Kubernetes knowledge. It would be tough to
    claim that you are not a Kubernetes newbie and yet you never created a Kubernetes
    cluster.

    and at least one Kubernetes cluster.
