    graphs for CIO, CTO, and other C-level executives and mid-level managers. Management
    works in multi-color, while engineers should be limited to dual-color terminals,
    mixed with a slightly increased color pallet of IDEs and editors we use to code.
    We produce commits, while managers fake interest by looking at UIs.

- en: The above phrase is a bit exaggerated. It’s not true that UIs are useful only
    to managers nor that they fake interest. At least, that’s not true for all of
    them. UIs do provide a lot of value but, unfortunately, they are often abused
    to the level of even postponing or even preventing automation. We’ll try to make
    an additional effort to remove Jenkins UI for any setup related tasks. We’ll try
    to automate everything.

- en: We already improved a lot our ability to install Jenkins. A mere switch from
    custom-made YAML files to Helm Charts is a considerable step forward from the
    operational perspective. The addition of ServiceAccounts bound to Roles improved
    security. But, there’s still one big thing left only partly explored. We did not
    yet reach the point where we can install and fully setup Jenkins from a command
    line. So far, there were always a few things we had to do manually from its UI.
    We’ll try to get rid of those steps in the hope that the only command we’ll need
    to execute is `helm install`.

- en: As it often goes, we cannot hope to fully automate the setup without going through
    manual steps first. So, we’ll start by exploring different use-cases. If we hit
    a road-block, we’ll try to figure out how to overcome it. The chances are that
    another one will be waiting for us after the first, and another one after that.
    We’re yet to see which obstacles we’ll encounter and which steps are missing until
    we make Jenkins fully operational and, at the same time, reasonably secure. We’ll
    try to automate the process only once we’re confident in the way we set up Jenkins
    manually.
