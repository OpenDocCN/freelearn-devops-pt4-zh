- en: Minikube creates a single-node cluster inside a VM on your laptop. While that
    is not ideal since we won’t be able to demonstrate some of the features Kubernetes
    provides in a multi-node setup, it should be more than enough to explain most
    of the concepts behind Kubernetes. Later on, we’ll move into a more production-like
    environment and explore the features that cannot be demonstrated in Minikube.

    should set up. The first in line is `kubectl`.

- en: Kubernetes’ command-line tool, `kubectl`, is used to manage a cluster and applications
    running inside it. We’ll use `kubectl` a lot throughout the book, so we won’t
    go into details just yet. Instead, we’ll discuss its commands through examples
    that will follow shortly. For now, think of it as your interlocutor with a Kubernetes
    cluster.
