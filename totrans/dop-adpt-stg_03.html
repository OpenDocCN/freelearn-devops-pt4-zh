			<p>The ability to demonstrate how DevOps can benefit your business is important when it comes to driving the changes required to succeed. This chapter looks at the business benefits of DevOps transformation, as well as the team topologies that can be used during DevOps transformation. Finally, this chapter looks at pitfalls and mistakes that can lead to the failure of DevOps transformation projects.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Key business benefits of DevOps</li>
				<li>Transformation topologies</li>
				<li>Transformation anti-patterns</li>
				<li>Avoiding failed transformation projects</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Key business benefits of DevOps</h1>
			<p>When it comes to DevOps transformation, buy-in from your executive leaders and senior <a id="_idIndexMarker069"/>management within your organization is fundamental. You will come up against serious challenges in your transformation without this support, and may even fail before you've really got started.</p>
			<p>One way to ensure you have the required buy-in is by making sure that executive leaders and senior management understand what the business benefits of DevOps are. You cannot simply explain the technical or local benefits to individual teams or leaders. They will want to know why this is worth the money they will spend on implementing this new way of working and how it will help the business move faster.</p>
			<p>In short, how <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>can you ensure that DevOps addresses the <strong class="bold">key performance indicators</strong> (<strong class="bold">KPIs</strong>) and business goals of your organization?</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">When starting out with DevOps transformation, look to gain executive support early in the process; that way, you can change your approach if needed, based on your discussions with executives and senior leaders.</p>
			<p>In order to best prepare for your meetings with senior leaders to discuss DevOps transformation with them, you first need to understand what the business goals are. This isn't at a high level; this is at a performance measurement level—what things are the business <a id="_idIndexMarker071"/>specifically looking for to turn the dial on their performance dashboards? These are areas you can look at in terms of how DevOps can help drive those KPIs within the business, such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer experience</strong> (<strong class="bold">CX</strong>)</li>
				<li>Business growth</li>
				<li>Cost savings</li>
				<li>Boost in productivity</li>
				<li>Improved employee retention</li>
				<li>Better-quality products</li>
				<li>Higher customer satisfaction</li>
				<li>Improved operational and process efficiency</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's now look at these elements in more detail to understand them better.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>CX</h2>
			<p>In any business, customers drive success, and a better CX ultimately drives renewals of products <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>and drives growth in the business. CX is vitally important to the success of any business. Improving the overall CX can boost things such as customer loyalty, retention, and profits, and can shorten sales cycles.</p>
			<p>In DevOps, improved production support is key and is one of the foundational pillars of why DevOps exists. This better collaboration between development teams and operations teams often ends up in a boost in the quality of the product. It is these elements that have a direct impact on CX.</p>
			<p>This alone <a id="_idIndexMarker073"/>ends up providing a huge boost in CX as the business and technical teams are focused on optimal output or—rather—the same goal.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Business growth</h2>
			<p>As sales and customer service grow, so do the prospects. In particular, there is a lot more <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>capital to work for a company with improved growth. This money can be rolled back into the business in order to further develop processes and systems. In addition, increased productivity and performance ensures that workers have more time and can be freed to work on more efficient, revenue-generating projects.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Cost savings</h2>
			<p>It should be noted that all of the changes and enhancements listed here help to reduce overall <a id="_idIndexMarker075"/>costs. Improved production and performance result in higher sales, lower operating costs, and higher customer satisfaction ratings, which in themselves further improve revenue. DevOps explicitly encourages a continuous cycle of change and development.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Boost in productivity</h2>
			<p>More engaged and loyal workers means higher productivity rates, particularly if they believe <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>in what they do. But it's more than just that factor that leads to improved productivity.</p>
			<p>In <strong class="bold">Information Technology</strong> (<strong class="bold">IT</strong>), teams are usually asked to do more with less money, which is <a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>where automation tools come into play. They can automate and refine internal processes that are repetitive and frequently rotate. DevOps honors this approach, even though it is extended to other areas of the market. Automating typical tasks frees up time for the workers, allowing them to concentrate on more meaningful tasks and spend more time on what they do.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Improved employee retention</h2>
			<p>Hands down, employee engagement is one of the most critical contributors to the success <a id="_idIndexMarker078"/>of an organization. If your workers are not satisfied, efficient, and compliant in their jobs, both performance and overall outcomes will suffer.</p>
			<p>High-performance and functional DevOps work environments are proven to greatly enhance employee experience. The trend encourages higher employee engagement and productivity, but also increases brand loyalty. And when your current workers are satisfied, this bodes well for retention rates and invites new talent to come your way.</p>
			<p>While a little obsolete now, Puppet's 2016 <em class="italic">State of DevOps Report </em>(<a href="https://puppet.com/resources/whitepaper/2016-state-of-devops-report">https://puppet.com/resources/whitepaper/2016-state-of-devops-report</a>) showed that promoters operating in DevOps-based organizations were 2.2 times more likely to recommend their business to a friend than those of low-performing DevOps firms.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Better-quality products</h2>
			<p>DevOps fosters a culture of consistent and optimal development, which inevitably results in <a id="_idIndexMarker079"/>improved applications and goods. Specifically, in software development, the idea is to reduce the amount of errors or bugs that occur in a product.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>Higher customer satisfaction</h2>
			<p>There is a strong connection between customer service and satisfaction. The better and more <a id="_idIndexMarker080"/>optimistic the experience, the higher the satisfaction rating. This means, of course, that because DevOps improves CX, it also improves customer satisfaction, provided that the deployment is carried out properly.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Improved operational and process efficiency</h2>
			<p>As DevOps calls for the reassessment and evolution of current processes and development <a id="_idIndexMarker081"/>operations, there is a trend toward improved performance. As companies aim to enhance their entire operation, they are moving toward processes, methods, and practices that deliver improved performance. Common sense dictates that, overall, the whole company will see productivity gains as a result.</p>
			<p>But <a id="_idIndexMarker082"/>there is also data to back up this move. A study by CA Technologies, <em class="italic">Accelerating Velocity and Customer Value with Agile and DevOps</em> (<a href="https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/accelerating-velocity-and-customer-value-with-agile-and-devops-research-paper">https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/accelerating-velocity-and-customer-value-with-agile-and-devops-research-paper</a>), shows that organizations implementing DevOps see a 40% increase in the KPIs they monitor for organizational or process performance.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Transformation topologies</h1>
			<p>Every organization is different; even organizations in the same sector are different, for a variety of <a id="_idIndexMarker083"/>different reasons. To make transition as effective as possible, there are many different topologies for working with other teams in your organization, outlined as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Development and operations collaboration</li>
				<li>Shared operations</li>
				<li>DevOps as a service</li>
				<li>DevOps advocacy</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Site reliability engineering</strong> (<strong class="bold">SRE</strong>)</li>
				<li>Container driven</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You will <a id="_idIndexMarker084"/>recognize some of these, possibly from your own organization. More do exist, though, and all of them are well documented with posters, available to purchase from <em class="italic">DevOps Topologies</em> (<a href="https://web.devopstopologies.com/">https://web.devopstopologies.com/</a>).</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">It would be commonplace for you to start your transformation journey aligning to one of the preceding topologies and then switch to another model once you are mature enough. There is nothing wrong with this approach and in most scenarios this would lend itself to a higher level of success, rather than aiming for the top at the first attempt.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Development and operations collaboration</h2>
			<p>The first model is probably the most popular and is often seen as the golden model or the <a id="_idIndexMarker085"/>promised land of DevOps. This model enables smooth collaboration between the development and operations teams within your organization and is depicted in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer006" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_02_01.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 – Diagram showing collaboration between developers and operations&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.1 – Diagram showing collaboration between developers and operations</p>
			<p>Each of the teams share knowledge where needed, but each of them will specialize in a specific product or part of the product. This will likely involve many different development teams.</p>
			<p>This model is highly effective and works very well in organizations that have strong technical leadership. A word of caution, though—in order to achieve this model, you will need to go through a substantial level of organizational change.</p>
			<p>In order to be successful, you will need a level of competence higher up in the management team. Also essential is that development and operations have very clearly expressed and demonstrably shared goals, be that improving reliability, increasing deployment frequency, or whatever your goal is.</p>
			<p>Your operations teams must be comfortable working with the development teams and be familiar <a id="_idIndexMarker086"/>with some of their processes and tooling; this would include <strong class="bold">test-driven development</strong> (<strong class="bold">TDD</strong>) and Git for source control. Added to that, on the developer's side, they must take operational features very seriously and seek input from the operations team on implementations of the features.</p>
			<p>Altogether, this needs a high level of cultural change from how those teams worked together <a id="_idIndexMarker087"/>in the past, so while highly effective, this is a difficult model to achieve. You may find yourself implementing a different model to start with and working toward this in the future as you mature.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Shared operations</h2>
			<p>If you work in an environment where you operate in product teams rather than individual <a id="_idIndexMarker088"/>functional teams, then we see the shared operations topology. In this topology, you see very little separation between the development and operations teams, and everyone is solely focused on a shared responsibility. The following diagram illustrates this:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer007" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_02_02.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2 – Diagram showing little separation between developers and operations&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.2 – Diagram showing little separation between developers and operations</p>
			<p>As with the previous model, this has the potential to be highly effective and will suit very well any organization that has a single product or service. Realistically, it's a form of the previous model we discussed but has some special features.</p>
			<p>Organizations with a single product—such as Netflix, Spotify, Facebook, and Twitter—can achieve this topology. I would say, though, that outside of that single product focus, this topology is not very applicable.</p>
			<p>In organizations where you have multiple product streams, the budget constraints—as well as the switching of focus between those product streams—will usually force your development <a id="_idIndexMarker089"/>and operations teams further apart, most likely back to the previous model.</p>
			<p>Another way to <a id="_idIndexMarker090"/>describe this topology would be <strong class="bold">NoOps</strong>. There is no visibly distinct operations team in this model.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>DevOps as a service</h2>
			<p>So far, we have looked at topologies that favor start-ups as they can build from the ground <a id="_idIndexMarker091"/>up in the right way, or enterprise organizations as they look to shift their operating model. For smaller organizations that may not have the budget, experience, or employees to lead operations aspects of the products they produce, the development teams may lean on an external service provider, as illustrated in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer008" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_02_03.jpg" alt="Figure 2.3 – Diagram showing the DevOps as a service topology&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.3 – Diagram showing the DevOps as a service topology</p>
			<p>The role of the service provider is to help them build out environments, provide automation of their infrastructure, and provide monitoring of the platform. The provider may also provide advice on the operational features needed in the development cycles.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Although we <a id="_idIndexMarker092"/>call the topology <strong class="bold">DevOps as a service</strong>, it's important to highlight that first, this model is not scalable, and customers must work the same way as the service provider for this to work well, which is not always possible.</p>
			<p>This topology is useful for smaller organizations to learn about the operational aspects involved, such as automation, configuration management, and monitoring. This is where the issue lies <a id="_idIndexMarker093"/>for service providers trying to implement this topology as a business, as those smaller organizations are likely to move toward the first or second topology once their skills have built up, as they take on more operational staff.</p>
			<p>Overall, this model has a chance to be somewhat effective with those smaller organizations with limited experience, but will likely stall if you try to implement it in larger organizations.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>DevOps advocacy</h2>
			<p>When organizations tend to lean toward a large gap between development and operations, we <a id="_idIndexMarker094"/>can introduce an advocacy topology as a facilitation team. This topology can be used to help keep development and operations talking and collaborating, and is illustrated in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer009" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_02_04.jpg" alt="Figure 2.4 – Diagram showing the DevOps advocacy topology&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.4 – Diagram showing the DevOps advocacy topology</p>
			<p>This topology works well in all types of organizations, especially where that tendency for drifting applies. The results from this topology can be mixed, but you potentially can have extremely effective results.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">When using the DevOps advocacy model, be aware of the DevOps team silo anti-pattern.</p>
			<p>In order to be <a id="_idIndexMarker095"/>highly effective, the advocacy team must have the specific remit of facilitating communication and collaboration <a id="_idIndexMarker096"/>between the development and operations teams. Members of the team are often called <strong class="bold">DevOps Advocates</strong>, as their purpose is to help spread awareness of DevOps practices and facilitate bringing teams closer together.</p>
			<p>A word of caution on this topology is that it can go wrong quickly. You must ensure that you keep your advocacy team separate from the day-to-day deliverables of the development and operations teams. They cannot get sucked into the work they do, otherwise they lose focus on their goal.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>SRE</h2>
			<p>Often referred <a id="_idIndexMarker097"/>to as the <strong class="bold">Google Model</strong>, this topology is <a id="_idIndexMarker098"/>different from the others we have explored so far. DevOps will often say that development teams should join on-call rotations, but it's not a requirement. Organizations, including Google, run a slightly different model with a specific hand-off from development to teams that run the software. This is where SRE comes in, as illustrated in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer010" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_02_05.jpg" alt="Figure 2.5 – Diagram showing the SRE topology&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.5 – Diagram showing the SRE topology</p>
			<p>What is crucial with this topology, though, is the understanding that the SRE team has the final say on the deployment of code to production. The team can reject releases that do not meet the operational standards and ask developers to resolve issues.</p>
			<p>Developers <a id="_idIndexMarker099"/>need to show the SRE team through logs, metrics, and test results that the release is of a high enough standard to be supported by the SRE team.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">With the SRE topology, you need to be careful about the development versus operations silos. Simply renaming your team to <em class="italic">Site Reliability Engineers</em> and hoping it will work will fix nothing.</p>
			<p>This topology is unique, in that while it sounds like a common model used in most organizations today, it will only really be suitable where a high degree of engineering and maturity exists. Otherwise, you will not fix anything and, without that level of maturity, the SRE team has no power to say no.</p>
			<p>For this reason, this topology can either be very ineffective or highly effective—which way that turns out is entirely down to your culture.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Container driven</h2>
			<p>Finally, we have the container-driven collaboration topology. Containers can remove the need for <a id="_idIndexMarker100"/>some of the collaboration between development and operations. This is achieved by encapsulating the development and any runtime requirements of the application in a container. The container acts as a boundary between the development and operations responsibilities, as illustrated in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer011" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_02_06.jpg" alt="Figure 2.6 – Diagram showing the container-driven topology&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.6 – Diagram showing the container-driven topology</p>
			<p>With a good engineering culture this topology works well, but if your developers start to ignore or not properly consider operational considerations, then this topology can revert to the usual <em class="italic">us and them</em>, just as with the SRE topology.</p>
			<p>Just as with the SRE topology, be aware of the development versus operations anti-pattern, where operations are just expected to run anything the developers throw their way.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Transformation anti-patterns</h1>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Transformation topologies</em>, we <a id="_idIndexMarker101"/>explored the models that aid DevOps transformation and looked at what they set out to achieve. Here, though, we are looking at anti-patterns: these are ways of working that can be counterproductive to your goals and hinder your progress of DevOps transformation.</p>
			<p>Each of the anti-patterns is specific, and I'm sure you will all have come across at least one of <a id="_idIndexMarker102"/>the following in your careers so far:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Development and operations silos.</li>
				<li>DevOps team silo.</li>
				<li>Development does not need operations.</li>
				<li>DevOps as a tooling team.</li>
				<li>Glorified SysAdmin.</li>
				<li>Operations embedded in development.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's look at each of them in detail in the following sections.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Development and operations silos</h2>
			<p>This is <a id="_idIndexMarker103"/>one anti-pattern I know everyone will have experience of. This is the classic situation of <em class="italic">throw it over the wall</em> (or insert any other phrase you might use). In many ways, this anti-pattern, illustrated in the following diagram, throws up lots of questions:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer012" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_02_07.jpg" alt="Figure 2.7 – Diagram showing the development and operations silos anti-pattern&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.7 – Diagram showing the development and operations silos anti-pattern</p>
			<p>From the developer's side, features can be marked as done and they can claim story points for them when their work is completed, but the feature may not be in production yet or may not even work in production.</p>
			<p>The operability suffers as well because developers will not have enough context for features <a id="_idIndexMarker104"/>within operations, and the operations teams do not have the time or will to engage with the developers to fix the problems before going live.</p>
			<p>Most of you will know that this is not the way we want to be working, but although we know this anti-pattern is bad and we know what the problems are, some topologies are, I think, worse.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>DevOps team silo</h2>
			<p>The only situation I can think of where a separate DevOps team operating in a silo would be acceptable <a id="_idIndexMarker105"/>is where that team is around for a temporary purpose. This could line up to the advocacy topology we discussed in the previous section, whereby that team has a clear mandate to bring teams closer together and improve collaboration and communication between them, as illustrated in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer013" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_02_08.jpg" alt="Figure 2.8 – Diagram showing the DevOps team silo anti-pattern&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.8 – Diagram showing the DevOps team silo anti-pattern</p>
			<p>This anti-pattern occurs when management or executives decide <em class="italic">they need to do DevOps</em> and start a <em class="italic">DevOps team</em>. This team will likely consist of people who are <em class="italic">DevOps engineers</em>; the problem is that this team will very quickly become their own silo. It will prevent developers and operations from becoming closer together, and tools and skills <a id="_idIndexMarker106"/>will become the subject of infighting, with everyone defending their corner.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Development does not need operations</h2>
			<p>When you mix the arrogance and naivety displayed by developers and their managers, specifically <a id="_idIndexMarker107"/>when starting new projects, often the assumption is made that operations is a thing of the past, especially when working with cloud-native technology. A wild underestimation is made about the sheer importance and complexity of good operational skills, as illustrated in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer014" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_02_09.jpg" alt="Figure 2.9 – Diagram showing the ''don't need operations'' anti-pattern&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.9 – Diagram showing the ''don't need operations'' anti-pattern</p>
			<p>The belief is that they can do operations without operations or use their spare time to cover the activities they perform. If teams recognize the importance of operations as a specialism that is as important and valuable as software development, then they would avoid lots of pain and basic operational mistakes.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>DevOps as a tooling team</h2>
			<p>While the <a id="_idIndexMarker108"/>outcomes of this team can be beneficial, its impact is very limited. You can benefit from an improved toolchain, but the fundamental problem is a lack of early operational involvement and collaboration throughout the development life cycle, as illustrated in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer015" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_02_10.jpg" alt="Figure 2.10 – Diagram showing the DevOps as a tooling team anti-pattern&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.10 – Diagram showing the DevOps as a tooling team anti-pattern</p>
			<p>A DevOps team is set up to work on the tooling required for deployment, such as pipelines, configuration management, secrets management, and so on. This happens when you <a id="_idIndexMarker109"/>set up a team in order to not affect the current developer team's velocity (delivery of stories).</p>
			<p>Operations teams continue to work in isolation and will continue to throw releases <em class="italic">over the wall</em>, just as with the first anti-pattern.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Glorified SysAdmin</h2>
			<p>The question of DevOps engineering has long been discussed. Many believe it's not a thing; I think <a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>it is, and it's widely adopted by many organizations. It's important to understand the differences between infrastructure engineers and DevOps engineers, though. I wrote a blog post on this very subject: <a href="https://blog.m12d.com/hiring-the-ideal-devops-candidate">https://blog.m12d.com/hiring-the-ideal-devops-candidate</a>. This anti-pattern is illustrated in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer016" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_02_11.jpg" alt="Figure 2.11 – Diagram showing the glorified SysAdmin anti-pattern&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.11 – Diagram showing the glorified SysAdmin anti-pattern</p>
			<p>This anti-pattern is very typical in organizations that have a low maturity in engineering. There is a strong desire to improve practices and reduce overheads, yet they will fail to recognize that IT is a core driver for the business.</p>
			<p>Industry success <a id="_idIndexMarker111"/>with DevOps is not evident; sadly, this means some organizations want to <em class="italic">do DevOps</em> just because their competitors are. Instead of reflecting on the gaps in the current structure and relationships within the teams, the decision is made to hire <em class="italic">DevOps engineers</em> for their operations teams.</p>
			<p>All this achieves is a rebranding of the previous infrastructure engineer role or SysAdmin role. There is no cultural or organizational change happening, other than the title often demanding a higher salary.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">It's the human communication and soft skills that makes DevOps thrive, not the technical skills.</p>
			<p>This anti-pattern is becoming more and more prevalent as people jump on the bandwagon, looking for candidates with tooling, automation, and cloud skills.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>Operations embedded in development</h2>
			<p>When an organization—for whatever reason—does not want to maintain a separate operations team, development teams take responsibility for infrastructure. When this happens <a id="_idIndexMarker112"/>in product-driven environments, those items of operational responsibility are subject to resource constraints and often deprioritization, leading to suboptimal approaches, as illustrated in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer017" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_02_12.jpg" alt="Figure 2.12 – Diagram showing the operations embedded in development anti-pattern&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.12 – Diagram showing the operations embedded in development anti-pattern</p>
			<p>As with many of the anti-patterns we have discussed, this one also shows a lack of appreciation for the importance of effective operational skills. The value of operations is severely diminished, as it is treated as an annoyance for developers.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Avoiding failed transformation projects</h1>
			<p>The reality is that projects fail. DevOps transformation is no different and, as with all projects, you <a id="_idIndexMarker113"/>should be prepared for this and wherever possible learn from others' mistakes, putting controls in place so that you not only learn from those mistakes but also prevent them from happening again.</p>
			<p>The top five reasons for DevOps transformation projects not going as planned and often getting abandoned are outlined here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Rooting DevOps initiatives within customer values</li>
				<li>Poor management of organizational change</li>
				<li>Failing to collaborate</li>
				<li>Failing to adopt an iterative approach</li>
				<li>Poor management of expectations in terms of DevOps initiatives</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's understand these reasons better.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Rooting DevOps initiatives within customer values</h2>
			<p>Many companies across sectors are advised by the business side that they need to move faster to <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>seek new opportunities and fight threats. You have this very real need for speed, but we have to make sure that we're grounding the need for speed in the value of the consumer. It's not enough that we need to get faster. We need to deliver value more quickly, or it may be that speed is not the concern; it is innovation that is required.</p>
			<p>In conditions that cause confusion when attempting to solve a business problem, DevOps will help businesses experiment quicker to find the right answer.</p>
			<p>Leaders who decide to do DevOps because of DevOps risk failure because workers do not have a connection to the word <em class="italic">DevOps</em>. Instead, you need to relate the benefit that these efforts offer to both workers and the company. This means knowing who the consumers are, what they consider to be important, and how to meet those needs.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Management of organizational change</h2>
			<p>One of the main issues, which I sadly see replicated over and over, is overlooking change in an organization.</p>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker115"/>you try to incorporate something major all at once without learning time, this leads to low success-rate improvements. Leaders should initiate organizational change by recognizing and expressing the importance of the consumer. DevOps and the required improvements that come with it are not optional, and workers must understand that, along with why a change is needed.</p>
			<p>We also need to concentrate on consumer satisfaction because customers are linked to value, not to the word <em class="italic">DevOps</em>. We need to iterate, to make sure that we have the ability to learn and develop.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Failing to collaborate</h2>
			<p>Effective <a id="_idIndexMarker116"/>DevOps projects require cooperation with all stakeholders to solve challenges that occur. However, many DevOps projects are limited to a single domain, which restricts their effectiveness.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Collaboration is a cornerstone of DevOps; failing to enable strong collaboration between teams will result in few changes to how you work, and may even make silos worse.</p>
			<p>Organizations also often make the mistake of hiring workers on the basis of their technical abilities rather than their willingness to cooperate. When we put together a DevOps team, we want a team of people who work together—people who enjoy teamwork. They're smart, they're driven, they're skilled, they keep themselves and others accountable, and they enjoy learning, because DevOps is definitely not static.</p>
			<p>We can still train good people on technical skills, but it's very hard to get people with poor attitudes and poor motivation to improve.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Failing to adopt an iterative approach</h2>
			<p>Launching DevOps in a single phase, giving training on Friday and starting the process on Monday, leads to higher failure rates, particularly for large organizations. A gradual, iterative <a id="_idIndexMarker117"/>approach lets companies concentrate on quality improvement and removes the danger of a quicker approach by allowing you a chance to learn, correct courses, improve every attempt, and step forward.</p>
			<p>We need to create an environment where learning is at the front and middle, and iteration will help us do that.</p>
			<p>The first-mover strategy is one of the better methods. <em class="italic">First mover</em> refers to a single-value stream with which businesses can be competitive by repetition and learning. The first movers should be politically friendly so that the stakeholders are willing to give DevOps a fair try, with the understanding that mistakes will happen and will be learned from, by creating an appropriate value to build credibility and increase support and presenting an acceptable level of risk to the company.</p>
			<p>Our <a id="_idIndexMarker118"/>aim is not to incorporate the entire toolchain and an end-to-end, be-all and end-all, integrated solution from development to output. Our aim is to improve the workflow and keep improving over time.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Management of expectations in terms of DevOps initiatives</h2>
			<p>It's normal for stakeholders to get interested in DevOps' efforts to anticipate the wrong things. For example, many expect a workflow to minimize costs when it's really supposed <a id="_idIndexMarker119"/>to be a value game. Another false expectation is that DevOps is all about resources that can be applied easily, when it's really a hard lifting in terms of organizational change.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">One of the single biggest things you can do to make DevOps transformation successful is set appropriate expectations. It always takes longer than you might think to transform to DevOps successfully.</p>
			<p>At the end of the day, it all comes down to making sure that what you can deliver is up to standard. It's also one of the reasons why I'm going to warn people to be very vigilant about what they're committed to. Whether they're using numbers from consulting organizations or using numbers from market surveys, and so on, you really don't know what that's going to bring you in particular. But please be aware of your expectations.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Decoding failed DevOps transformation</h2>
			<p>Before <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>we unravel the <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>reasons behind the failure of DevOps, the crucial part is to understand what DevOps is. This is a point that we dealt with in <a href="B17192_01_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor012"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introducing DevOps and Agile</em>, but let's summarize those points once more, as follows: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>DevOps is more than team collaboration.</li>
				<li>DevOps is more than a toolchain.</li>
				<li>DevOps is more than a software development model.</li>
				<li>DevOps is more than agility and quality.</li>
				<li>DevOps is more than a bridge between development and operations.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Arguably, there is so much content about DevOps that it leads to confusion, and this causes <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>issues during <a id="_idIndexMarker123"/>implementation for organizations. Some large organizations with the best tools struggle with DevOps because they do not get the basics right.</p>
			<h3>Culture has a huge impact on success</h3>
			<p>If you cast your mind back to <a href="B17192_01_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor012"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introducing DevOps and Agile</em>, I illustrated the importance <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/>of working on culture first before anything else. Culture is traditions, values, and beliefs that strengthen the organizational structure. DevOps is not just a collection of tools; you need to build a DevOps culture in your organization to get results.</p>
			<h3>Tools alone cannot help, so how do you set the right culture?</h3>
			<p>This follows on from the previous point, really. Organizations run after tools to achieve their aims, not <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>cultural changes. This alone is one of the biggest causes of failure when it comes to DevOps.</p>
			<p>The truth is that culture is tricky and difficult. We discuss this in greater detail in later chapters.</p>
			<h3>Defining DevOps for your organization</h3>
			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>digital age, any organization is a technology-driven organization, regardless of the domain. The journey from <em class="italic">digital transformation</em> to <em class="italic">continuous digital journey</em> requires versatility, agility, and consistency as the most oriented aspects.</p>
			<p>DevOps has become a necessity for companies concerned with software distribution or that also release upgrades or new functionality to serve their customers with consistency and supremacy.</p>
			<p>Without <a id="_idIndexMarker127"/>a question, DevOps will make software development easier, but every company has a different set of requirements.</p>
			<h3>Automation and speed may not be what you think</h3>
			<p>Knight Capital, a real-time stock trading firm, used automation to make trades quicker and <a id="_idIndexMarker128"/>simpler for their customers. When writing new code for their application, the new code was mistakenly named the same as an old feature, which was inactive but was not removed from the application.</p>
			<p>As a result, Knight's application made purchases worth billions in a matter of minutes, and the company had to pay a fine of <strong class="bold">US Dollars</strong> (<strong class="bold">USD</strong>) 640 million, which resulted in bankruptcy.</p>
			<p>Often, organizations misinterpret automation. DevOps automates the software development <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>process with the help of <strong class="bold">continuous integration/continuous delivery</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>) principles. There are a huge number of tools available for source code management, testing, maintenance, and storage.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Automation is an <a id="_idIndexMarker130"/>incredibly powerful component, but you should never forget the power of the machine-man combination to improve accuracy.</p>
			<h3>DevOps means empowering everyone in the team</h3>
			<p>People are <a id="_idIndexMarker131"/>one of the key reasons for the failure of DevOps. It can't be all about growth and operating teams.</p>
			<p>DevOps needs the participation of all the people on the team who consider teamwork to be a key function. To make DevOps effective, you need to find the right people, give them the right skills, and give them time to experience the DevOps culture.</p>
			<p>A software engineer from a popular website was reorganizing database columns into a database-related tool in order to sharpen their own understanding. At the same time, they were <a id="_idIndexMarker132"/>not aware that they were also modifying column orders in the actual database. This resulted in the server being inaccessible to many users.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>That concludes the second chapter. In this chapter, we looked at the key business benefits that DevOps brings to your organization, as well as looking at the topologies you can align your teams to for the greatest success. Flipping that around, we looked at anti-patterns, which are the team patterns to avoid when it comes to DevOps transformation. Finally, we looked at how to avoid failed DevOps transformation projects and looked at an example of how DevOps has failed. </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we look at how you can measure success within your organization and the importance of setting appropriate goals.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Questions</h1>
			<p>Let's now look back on this chapter and validate what we have learned. See if you can answer the following questions: </p>
			<ol>
