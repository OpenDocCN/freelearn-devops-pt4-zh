			<p>In this chapter, we will look at what culture means in DevOps, how you build a successful DevOps culture within an organization, and why culture is an important aspect of DevOps. We'll look at the characteristics of DevOps culture and how to maintain a strong culture within your organization, as well as how to break down existing silos in your organization.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What is a DevOps culture?</li>
				<li>Why is culture important?</li>
				<li>Maintaining a strong culture</li>
				<li>Breaking down silos in your organization</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>What is a DevOps culture?</h1>
			<p>In previous chapters, we <a id="_idIndexMarker195"/>discussed a little bit about culture. Now, it's time to go into more detail. Culture has many meanings but for DevOps, when we talk about culture, we're really talking about a shared understanding between development and operations teams, as well as a shared responsibility for the applications they build. That then roughly translates to the following things:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Increasing transparency</li>
				<li>Better communication</li>
				<li>Collaboration across teams</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Despite what some people think, there is much more to DevOps than technology. DevOps is not a technological evolution of your tooling or the platforms that you use within your organization.</p>
			<p>Culture in DevOps is also not <a id="_idIndexMarker196"/>letting teams define their own destiny; it is about working together. Implementing these things can be scary, but I want to take you through four things that can help practice this and build up the right culture in your organization.</p>
			<p>All the things we are about to look at will help with the preceding key bullet points and start to foster the right culture in your organization.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>Roles and responsibilities workshop</h2>
			<p>Defining very clear roles and responsibilities <a id="_idIndexMarker197"/>for your team helps create a strong culture. It prevents people from wondering what they should be doing and ensures that everyone knows not only what they are doing but how important everyone's role is to the overall team.</p>
			<p>Include your team in this session; it's a very fulfilling experience and one that creates a mutual contract with your team, as everyone has participated in the development of the roles and responsibilities for the team.</p>
			<p>Look at the following diagram. This is an example of <a id="_idIndexMarker198"/>what the output from a roles and responsibilities workshop looks like:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer022" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_04_01.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1 – Example roles and responsibilities matrix&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.1 – Example roles and responsibilities matrix</p>
			<p>You can use the preceding example to, with the help of your team, define the roles within your organization and then complete the responsibilities the rest of the team thinks that role should have.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">If you are working remotely, convert this into a Word document and share it so it can be edited by the team collaboratively.</p>
			<p>Once you have <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/>completed this step, work with the team to discuss what you have come up with and get an agreement of <a id="_idIndexMarker200"/>where the responsibilities lie. You may even find yourself moving them to another role, and that's OK, just as long as you make sure the team is in agreement.</p>
			<p>Once the session is completed, make sure you share it with your team first, ensuring that no more feedback needs to happen. Once everyone is finished, inform other leaders that this is the way your team will be working.</p>
			<p>This highly collaborative approach creates a strong relationship within the team, one that is difficult to break and will set you up for success.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-91"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>Rules of engagement</h2>
			<p>It may sound like a term <a id="_idIndexMarker201"/>from the military, but this is a serious exercise and can prove valuable in the future. Think of the output of this exercise as a <a id="_idIndexMarker202"/>social contract with your team, one that should be refreshed on a quarterly basis.</p>
			<p>Defining your rules of engagement defines <em class="italic">how you will work together</em>. If you are in a cross-functional team, then defining these rules early in the process can prevent tension from building up in the team. You could also call this a working agreement for your team.</p>
			<p>Start by asking your team some simple questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>As a team, what is important to us?</li>
				<li>How can we avoid mistakes of the past?</li>
				<li>What do teams who work well together do that we can adopt?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Ask your team to write down their answers privately, to begin with. This moment of reflection for the team will help set the tone of the session. Next, ask the team to write down one statement that will make working together as a team successful.</p>
			<p>When you are finished, collate all the <a id="_idIndexMarker203"/>answers together and combine any similar statements together. If you have a small team of fewer than five people, ask them to write down two statements.</p>
			<p>Then you vote on <a id="_idIndexMarker204"/>the ideas as a team. The idea of the vote is a collaborative one, and the result is a commitment written down in the agreement. If an idea gets a vote of no, just ask what it would take to make it a yes and see whether the team agrees.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Follow up with your agreement regularly with the team; put it somewhere the team visits frequently so they are reminded of what you collectively agreed to.</p>
			<p>The key is to facilitate an open discussion with the team that gets them thinking about how to work together successfully. Keep it open, honest, and, above all, respectful.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-92"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>Retrospectives</h2>
			<p>Running retrospectives is <a id="_idIndexMarker205"/>something that if you practice agile you will be used to already. This technique focuses on getting the team together after each sprint and discussing the previous sprint in detail. Along with the <strong class="bold">Scrum Master</strong>, the <a id="_idIndexMarker206"/>team will look at the accomplishments of the last sprint as well as the things that did not go as planned and could be improved.</p>
			<p>The atmosphere in retrospectives is <a id="_idIndexMarker207"/>one that fosters continuous improvement and learning. It is considered a safe space to discuss what is working, what may not be working, and what could be changed. Retrospectives are run after each sprint usually.</p>
			<p>For larger organizations, you could run them by leaders from each of your teams monthly to discuss the adoption of DevOps. Much like sprint retrospectives, discuss with your leaders what is working, what is not working, and what they would change about your DevOps transformation.</p>
			<p>The technique for running a retrospective is easy. A quick search will find numerous different ways of running a retrospective and from time to time, you should change how you run your retrospectives to keep the team engaged. I find them incredibly valuable to run as a leader and preparing for them takes no time at all. You should allow around 1 hour for your retrospective. You can even run them online very easily.</p>
			<p>If you complete your <a id="_idIndexMarker208"/>retrospective in the office, then for your meeting space, ensure you get a whiteboard and some markers, as well as sticky notes and a timer displayed somewhere easily visible.</p>
			<p>If you are running a <a id="_idIndexMarker209"/>remote retrospective, you can use software to have people place their virtual sticky notes on the appropriate heading. For in-person meetings, you can set up four different areas for people to place their sticky notes.</p>
			<p>Now, for running a very simple retrospective, here is what you need to do with some appropriate timings:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Preparation (15 mins)</strong>: Either digitally or on paper, set up four headings: <em class="italic">What Went Well</em>, <em class="italic">What Did Not Go Well</em>, <em class="italic">What Can We Do Better?</em>, and finally have one for <em class="italic">Actions</em>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Ground rules (5 mins)</strong>: Take no more than a few minutes to explain and set the ground rules. The key thing for every retrospective is to remember comments are not personal; every comment is valid, so listen with an open mind. Set the time period you will discuss (last sprint, month, quarter, and so on) and focus on improvement rather than pointing blame.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">What went well (15 mins)</strong>: Either write down and place upon the appropriate heading or create a digital card with your personal thoughts for what went well in the previous time period.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">What did not go well (15 mins)</strong>: Either write down and place upon the appropriate heading or create a digital card with your personal thoughts for what did not go well in the previous time period.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">What can we do better? (15 mins)</strong>: Either write down and place upon the appropriate heading or create a digital card with your personal thoughts for what you can do better compared to the previous time period.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Actions (10 mins)</strong>: Finally, capture any actions from the retrospective. Ensure you take pictures of the outcomes or screenshots if you are working virtually. Discuss the ideas <a id="_idIndexMarker210"/>presented and assign responsibility for follow-up.<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p><p class="callout">If you end up with a large amount of action, then use a voting system to enable yourself as a team to prioritize any immediate actions. Good examples of voting systems include Lean Coffee and Scrum poker.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>understand what DevOps culture is, it's now necessary to understand why that culture is important.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-93"><a id="_idTextAnchor092"/>Why is culture important?</h1>
			<p>I always like to <a id="_idIndexMarker212"/>describe culture as the backbone of DevOps. Think of DevOps like a tree where you have people, processes, and technology as branches, but they're all connected by culture.</p>
			<p>In my various years working in and around DevOps with different organizations, all the work I have done has taught me that you can have the best processes in the world, the best engineers, and the best technology to support it, but if you don't have the best culture and do not look to improve on that culture, then it's all wasted effort.</p>
			<p>Earlier in the chapter, we listed out the three important aspects of culture in DevOps; let's take a reminder of what those are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Increasing transparency</li>
				<li>Better communication</li>
				<li>Collaboration across teams</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To understand why culture is important, let's take a look at these three areas in more detail. That way, we can build up a picture of why culture is so important.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-94"><a id="_idTextAnchor093"/>Increasing transparency</h2>
			<p>Transparency is fundamental in <a id="_idIndexMarker213"/>many parts of business, but the further down the hierarchy you get, this can dilute, not on purpose but due to the way teams work and have worked historically. It is generally not the fault of specific individuals but rather a drift in culture from the organization as a whole.</p>
			<p>Development teams are <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/>usually under a great deal of pressure to release software in their organization, which can lead to those teams going around the edges when it comes to controls put in place by operations. This single thing is what fundamentally leads to tension between teams as the developers now have infrastructure that is nonstandard and consumed in a way that operations cannot control. This all leads <a id="_idIndexMarker215"/>to what we call <strong class="bold">shadow IT</strong>.</p>
			<p>You will find that many people point to public cloud services as a reason for this lack of transparency; however, this has been an issue long before the public cloud was even discussed. It is in fact the era of self-service that made this worse but even then, this has happened for a long time before either self-service or public cloud.</p>
			<p>If you think of developers requesting virtual machines from the self-service portal, the operations team will deploy that infrastructure with the operating system only. At that point, their operations have no insight into that infrastructure anymore.</p>
			<p>You can say the same about the public cloud as well, and this is what happens in many organizations when developers voice their displeasure about the performance of operations slowing down their work. They go to a public cloud provider and consume the services themselves.</p>
			<p>What are the three <a id="_idIndexMarker216"/>main disadvantages of this approach, though?</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Verification of compliance with standards</li>
				<li>Infrastructure utilization and efficiency</li>
				<li>Cost control</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Almost every organization I have spoken to at the start of their cloud journey has cited cost control as a problem. But what does this mean? Let's now look at some ways to improve transparency.</p>
			<h3>Verification of compliance with standards</h3>
			<p>With the delivery of a <a id="_idIndexMarker217"/>baseline operating system, or for cloud-native resources the baseline configuration of that resource, applications that are deployed and any database instances deployed on the virtual machines are all items that have standards in most organizations for compliance.</p>
			<p>As an operations team, when you are blind to what is deployed on your servers and have limited control, you lose ground in your security posture and end up not knowing whether the applications and development tools are security patched.</p>
			<p>The exact same scenario can be said when consumed directly from a cloud provider without the knowledge of the operations team.</p>
			<h3>Infrastructure utilization and efficiency</h3>
			<p>If your developers build 10 machines, with <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>limited control, operations have no idea whether those resources are fully utilized, when they are utilized, whether they can be turned off outside of working hours, or whether they apply for a special licensing benefit.</p>
			<p>These decisions, or lack of decisions, can have implications for capacity planning and the future ability to scale the platform and build critical services.</p>
			<h3>Cost control</h3>
			<p>Finally, developers are <a id="_idIndexMarker219"/>unlikely to realize the benefits of a cloud provider if they take that route on their own, the benefits of a scalable platform, and the benefits of overall spending a cloud platform can bring.</p>
			<p>Spending outside of the main budget has an overall detrimental effect on the business and its ability to operate without distractions.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor094"/>Better communication</h2>
			<p>Some of the <a id="_idIndexMarker220"/>things we have just <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>discussed fall quite naturally into better communication as well. Imagine if developers and operations were able to communicate better with each other. From an infrastructure perspective, they could collaborate with operations to work on templates that match their requirements and operations could explain the controls in place for the security of the business.</p>
			<p>That mutual <a id="_idIndexMarker222"/>understanding then becomes working practice and the developers get the infrastructure builds in a timely manner and operations keep control.</p>
			<p>This isn't the only place <a id="_idIndexMarker223"/>where better communication helps you build culture though. Communication can be made more efficient in a number of different ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Operations participation in sprint planning</li>
				<li>Developers performing releases</li>
				<li>Operations working in development sprints</li>
				<li>Developers working in operations</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These examples may seem trivial, but they can have a real impact on the overall experience of those involved and can make them think about their interactions. Over time, this helps improve communication.</p>
			<h3>Operations participating in sprint planning</h3>
			<p>One of the <a id="_idIndexMarker224"/>classic pieces of feedback you will hear from operations teams is that developers rarely develop for the environment and that operational challenges, concerns, and requests are not taken into account.</p>
			<p>One of the models we discussed in the <em class="italic">Transformation topologies</em> section in <a href="B17192_02_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor038"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Business Benefits, Team Topologies, and Pitfalls of DevOps</em>, talks about bringing operations and developers closer together. In <a href="B17192_01_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor012"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introducing DevOps and Agile</em>, we also discussed how agile plays a part in DevOps. When you start to move toward agile working, getting closer to one of the transformation topologies we explored, you will start to have operation teams working more closely with developers anyway.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">When operations participate in planning and before work on the sprint starts, they have a chance to voice any concerns about things the developers may not have considered that are in their field of expertise.</p>
			<p>Starting this <a id="_idIndexMarker225"/>process early can have real benefits. At the beginning, it will be tricky, and it may feel unnatural for people who have not worked this way before, but persevere with it and the results will be clear.</p>
			<p>Completely changing the way people work presents them with challenges and you will come up against resistance.</p>
			<h3>Developers performing releases</h3>
			<p>For many organizations, it is the developers who take the <a id="_idIndexMarker226"/>compiled applications and release them to the production environment. Try having your developers work with operations to specifically perform releases.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">We want conversations between operations and development to be authentic and transparent. If both teams are notified of this change in the process in advance, it can lead to prepared statements and assumptions. Bring the operations team into a normal stand-up and allow this feedback to happen in real time.</p>
			<p>The benefit of doing this is that your developers should start to understand and have an appreciation of the work that needs to be done with every release of the application.</p>
			<h3>Operations working in development sprints</h3>
			<p>In a similar fashion to previously, flip <a id="_idIndexMarker227"/>that around and have your operations teams do some work during the sprints with developers. Not only will they gain an appreciation and understanding of the development process, but you will also find that they can contribute during the sprint on operational matters.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Doing this can mean that operational issues are resolved during the development sprint and before release, rather than an issue coming up after release and causing more tension between teams.</p>
			<p>The majority of the time, you <a id="_idIndexMarker228"/>will find that operations teams cannot write software, so bring some of the operational tasks you would normally perform into the sprint, not only will you get better at communication, but you will start collaborating as well.</p>
			<h3>Developers working in operations</h3>
			<p>Just as mentioned before, flip that idea on its head and have developers working with operations. This will give the developers an understanding of how important it is to understand the operational elements.</p>
			<p>This working model <a id="_idIndexMarker229"/>can increase collaboration as well as communication and give a mutual understanding. Now developers understand what happens during an outage, how monitoring works, and how instrumentation in the application affects the operational processes, which will make a difference in how the application is developed, for the better.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor095"/>Collaboration across teams</h2>
			<p>What exactly do we mean when <a id="_idIndexMarker230"/>we say collaboration? In the context of DevOps, it is working and creating together. Collaboration is <a id="_idIndexMarker231"/>essential for any business but when your teams are both diverse and global in presence, this is even more important.</p>
			<p>From a technology perspective, you'll find no shortage of tools to enable your teams to collaborate more. But when we talk about collaboration, how do we define it, and how can we improve it?</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Collaboration tools can help, but they're not the whole solution. Choose a collaboration tooling that fits your needs the best.</p>
			<p>The primary goal of collaboration within DevOps is to reduce any operational delays that exist as well as communication gaps with teams that are geographically dispersed. This is the part of DevOps that requires the cultural step change so many people talk about.</p>
			<p>Your teams need both <a id="_idIndexMarker232"/>shared goal definitions and a single-team approach to their work. Identify a common set of goals, which lays the foundation for the future working relationship. Managers and leaders should also create a culture of inspiration, honesty, trust, and respect in their teams. This makes everyone feel like a part of the team and creates a stronger bond and message of what you are trying to achieve.</p>
			<p>A clear roadmap is also critical that defines your path to success and helps in achieving the goals you have set out to do. The roadmap should be crystal clear with the avoidance of any ambiguity. Regular check-ins and discussions with your teams also help provide clarity as you progress.</p>
			<p>One final point here is <a id="_idIndexMarker233"/>about diversity, which is key. A close-knit team requires you to get to know everyone and how they work, and even understanding their culture and personal situations. In remote teams, when people work in different time zones and have different cultures and religions, this is incredibly important.</p>
			<p>Now we understand in detail why culture in DevOps is important for our organization. Let's look at how you maintain that culture and develop it.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor096"/>Maintaining a strong culture</h1>
			<p>Now that you have <a id="_idIndexMarker234"/>spent time building up the culture in your organization, the last thing you want to do is see all that effort go to waste. It's important to maintain the culture you have built up so far, so it continues to foster the good practices you have put in place already. In fact, a survey by DZone (<a href="https://dzone.com/articles/top-10-barriers-to-devops">https://dzone.com/articles/top-10-barriers-to-devops</a>) found that 14% of people said culture was a barrier to DevOps adoption.</p>
			<p>As with most things, though, the daily running of a team and business can provide a number of threats to how strong you can maintain culture. Some things can even have a negative effect. Some of these might include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Starters and leavers</li>
				<li>Pushing too hard for success</li>
				<li>Lack of innovation</li>
				<li>Cultural differences</li>
				<li>Lack of buy-in</li>
			</ul>
			<p>How can we avoid these roadblocks to our culture? Let's have a look at each of them.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>Starters and leavers</h2>
			<p>In any organization, people leave and people start. This is one of the most common elements of any business. Hopefully, the culture you have created means that when people leave, they are leaving for better opportunities that your business cannot provide, rather than leaving because of acrimonious reasons.</p>
			<p>Knowing how to deal with <a id="_idIndexMarker235"/>starters and leavers in high-performing agile teams is something that agile leaders have to deal with all the time. It's important that you start off any new member of staff the way you mean to go on.</p>
			<p>This starts with making sure you bring the right people on board, which is easier said than done. As you already have an open culture with the team, seek out thoughts from the team about what a new member of staff should bring to the team. Be prepared to listen in a collaborative way, but also be prepared with your own ideas so you can counter if you feel the need.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">When it comes to the interview process, include members of the team to validate your thinking on the individual's attributes and what they can bring to the business.</p>
			<p>When it comes to leavers, following the practices you have in place should ensure that when a member of the team leaves, they don't leave a large hole in the way you work. Of course, people often become good friends with their colleagues and someone leaving can have an emotional impact on a team more than anything else.</p>
			<p>Watch out, though, as this emotional impact can start to affect productivity and quality. The longer a team has worked together, the better rhythm they have together and when that is broken, it can have an effect on the team.</p>
			<p>Replace the member of the team as soon as you possibly can to reduce any impact. Someone new in the team can often bring new ideas to everyone and give the team a renewed energy.</p>
			<p>When you have a significant change, run the roles and responsibilities exercise at the top of the chapter. Before the member of staff leaves, run a retrospective. If you think about it, that person leaving is a key moment and one that can be time-boxed. Learn from a wider perspective what worked, what did not work, and what could be improved.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor098"/>Pushing too hard for success</h2>
			<p>When you have put lots of effort into building a culture and seen positive results, you can get into a mindset that makes you push too hard for more success. This can be as a team or as an individual. Either one of these will have a detrimental effect on what you have done so far and will be something you need to monitor closely.</p>
			<p>The simple reason to <a id="_idIndexMarker236"/>watch out for this is that when you start to push for success, you can slip back into old ways and cut corners to get more success. Stick to your guns, though, and don't overcommit work you cannot deliver and keep producing the strong results you have got used to at this point.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Following the processes of continuous feedback and continuous improvement will yield more success as you progress. Let it come naturally and don't force the issue.</p>
			<p>If you do that, you will find that success comes naturally to you and you don't need to push yourself or your team for more success.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor099"/>Lack of innovation</h2>
			<p>One attribute of high-performing teams is their ability to innovate. Teams that are used to having the ability to innovate will continue to crave innovation. The ability to experiment and innovate is critical to the success of any business.</p>
			<p>Watch out for the pace of innovation slowing down, or worse, other teams putting barriers up to your team innovating. This should be considered a red flag and one that makes you focus as a team to resolve the issues preventing you from innovating.</p>
			<p>Try not to get too distracted by this and deal with the situation as a leader, letting your team continue as normal. Do not, though, engage with the team and tell them they're no longer able to innovate.</p>
			<p>Many DevOps professionals set themselves apart from others due to their ability to innovate quickly and come up with new ideas. Telling them they cannot do something that is within their domain of expertise is going to be damaging to the overall team and the culture you have built up.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>Cultural differences</h2>
			<p>We have already talked a couple of times about remote teams, especially ones that are geographically dispersed. We discussed earlier as well about diversity and the important role that it plays.</p>
			<p>Cultural differences also <a id="_idIndexMarker237"/>refer to those of the teams you work with. Everyone has an understanding of how things may be done within the organization. The problem, as we discussed, when looking at anti-patterns is that they may not line up with what you want to do as a team. The whole reason for this is why DevOps now exists.</p>
			<p>You can combat cultural differences in the team objectives by aligning goals. The key here is to keep doing this time and time again to make sure teams are tightly aligned. When team goals start to diverge is when they start to operate in old ways again.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-102"><a id="_idTextAnchor101"/>Lack of buy-in</h2>
			<p>Apart from the lack of innovation, one of the biggest impediments to maintaining culture is still the lack of buy-in. You may be thinking that to get to this point you have done the hard work and executives are already bought in. Of course, you are right, but just like in your own team, executives change, priorities of the business change, and the business trading environment can change.</p>
			<p>This is a common situation, and you need to make sure leaders are still bought into what you are doing, the reasons why you are doing it, and the results you have achieved so far to get you there.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">When it comes to buy-in, don't be complacent. Leaders change, and with this change can come new ideas on how things should be done.</p>
			<p>To combat this, keep a note of the successes you have had as a team and make sure you can replay your journey along DevOps to show how that success has come about.</p>
			<p>As you can see, it takes effort to not only build the culture but maintain it as well. Make sure you visit some of the <a id="_idIndexMarker238"/>tips and exercises shared in this section to keep the culture in your teams strong. Now, let's look at how to break down the silos that exist within your organization.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor102"/>Breaking down silos in your organization</h1>
			<p>In DevOps, culture is brought about by the need to break down silos in your organization between <a id="_idIndexMarker239"/>certain teams. Silo mentality is behavior-driven and can be resolved using a number of techniques. A silo exists when teams operate independently and often have a crossover of their activities or lack of consideration for others' work.</p>
			<p>The danger of silos in the business world is that trust is destroyed, communication is cut off, and complacency starts to set into what you do day to day. Teams that are siloed cannot react to change quickly or take advantage of opportunities that present themselves.</p>
			<p>Worst of all is transparency, when data cannot be shared between teams freely, which impacts your ability to make data-driven decisions about your team or business. Some of the things we are about to discuss we have touched upon before:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Creating one vision for team collaboration</li>
				<li>Working toward common goals with collaboration tools</li>
				<li>Educating together, working together, and training together</li>
				<li>Communicating often</li>
				<li>Evaluating team compensation</li>

			<p>Let's look at each of these in a little more detail.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/>Creating one vision for team collaboration</h2>
			<p>We talked earlier about the importance of creating common goals for your teams and how they should also share one vision. It is counterproductive to have a vision for one team that is completely separate from another if they do no move toward a greater result.</p>
			<p>All teams should share, buy into, and adopt that one vision. When goals that conflict with other teams are set, silo mentality begins, meaning silos are often created by management.</p>
			<p>The leadership team must understand the long-term goals, departmental objectives, and key initiatives of the organization, before passing the unified vision down to the teams. The unified leadership team will, thanks to this approach, encourage trust, create a sense of empowerment, and break managers out of the <em class="italic">my department</em> mentality and into the <em class="italic">our organization</em> mentality.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor104"/>Working toward common goals with collaboration tools</h2>
			<p>The biggest downside to <a id="_idIndexMarker240"/>the silo mentality is that people see things from their perspective. This, of course, is not always a bad thing, but when this happens, people will make choices toward their own team, rather than from the company perspective.</p>
			<p>One of the simplest ways to keep everyone on point with common goals is to use a dashboard to highlight progress toward your common goals. This is a form of collaboration.</p>
			<p>When organizations give their employees quality tools for collaboration, people will naturally share more information and because of that communicate better with each other.</p>
			<p>Finally, when the entire organization looks to understand each department (sometimes each team) and the specific issues they face on a day-to-day basis, departmental goals can become the goals of the entire company.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-106"><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/>Educating together, working together, and training together</h2>
			<p>From experience, one of the easiest ways to break down silo thinking is to perform cross-organization exercises and events. Training on this level can really help start breaking down silos as they get to know other people in the organization.</p>
			<p>Working together can also have a big impact. Consider the idea of sitting people closer to each other if feasible. When people work close to others, they build rapport; as problems in their work arise, they look to those close by for answers. This can have a big impact.</p>
			<p>Specific training is also a key way to make sure that you can shift the silo mindset from your organization. This training involves supporting the ideas of collaboration, teamwork, and communication.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-107"><a id="_idTextAnchor106"/>Communicating often</h2>
			<p>I firmly believe you <a id="_idIndexMarker241"/>cannot over-communicate. Regardless of the situation, frequency of communication is very important. When you communicate often, this introduces a level of trust and transparency.</p>
			<p>When teams feel this level of trust and transparency, data flows between teams and facilitates the breaking down of silos rather than breaking them down by one action of communication.</p>
			<p>Organizational structure is a silo and some organizations try and remove this structure to remove silos. This will not always work though. It's more effective to communicate properly in this situation than to remove that organizational structure, which is important to the delegation of duties.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-108"><a id="_idTextAnchor107"/>Evaluating team compensation</h2>
			<p>Competition between teams can be very healthy, but compensation plans between teams can create silos and an unhealthy relationship where competition becomes the goal rather than working together.</p>
			<p>If you have bonus or compensation plans within your business, make sure that they reflect the goals you set as an organization and do not play teams off against each other and what they are setting out to do.</p>
			<p>When compensation plans align with the company goals, employees are driven to collaborate, communicate, and achieve goals together.</p>
