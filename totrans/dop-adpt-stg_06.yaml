    a successful DevOps culture within an organization, and why culture is an important

    to go into more detail. Culture has many meanings but for DevOps, when we talk
    about culture, we''re really talking about a shared understanding between development

  zh: 增加透明度
- en: Transparency is fundamental in many parts of business, but the further down
    the hierarchy you get, this can dilute, not on purpose but due to the way teams
    work and have worked historically. It is generally not the fault of specific individuals
    but rather a drift in culture from the organization as a whole.
  id: totrans-67
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 透明度在许多商业领域是基础，但随着层级的降低，透明度可能会稀释，这并非有意为之，而是因为团队的工作方式和历史积淀所致。这通常不是某个具体个人的过错，而是组织整体文化的漂移。
- en: Development teams are usually under a great deal of pressure to release software
    in their organization, which can lead to those teams going around the edges when
    it comes to controls put in place by operations. This single thing is what fundamentally
    leads to tension between teams as the developers now have infrastructure that
    is nonstandard and consumed in a way that operations cannot control. This all
    leads to what we call **shadow IT**.
  id: totrans-68
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 开发团队通常面临巨大的压力，要在组织内发布软件，这可能导致这些团队绕过运维团队所设定的控制措施。正是这一点根本上导致了团队之间的紧张关系，因为开发人员现在拥有非标准的基础设施，而且这种基础设施的使用方式无法被运维控制。这一切最终导致了我们所说的**影子
    IT**。
- en: You will find that many people point to public cloud services as a reason for
    this lack of transparency; however, this has been an issue long before the public
    cloud was even discussed. It is in fact the era of self-service that made this
    worse but even then, this has happened for a long time before either self-service
    or public cloud.

- en: If you think of developers requesting virtual machines from the self-service
    portal, the operations team will deploy that infrastructure with the operating
    system only. At that point, their operations have no insight into that infrastructure
    anymore.

  zh: 如果你把开发人员请求虚拟机的过程看作是通过自助门户进行的，运维团队将只部署操作系统的基础设施。此时，他们对该基础设施不再有任何洞察。

    organization between certain teams. Silo mentality is behavior-driven and can
    be resolved using a number of techniques. A silo exists when teams operate independently
    and often have a crossover of their activities or lack of consideration for others'
    work.
