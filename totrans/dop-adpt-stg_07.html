			<h1 id="_idParaDest-111"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>Chapter 5</em>: Avoiding Cultural Anti-Patterns in DevOps</h1>
			<p>Following on from learning about the specific challenges of breaking down silos between teams and understanding the importance of culture in DevOps, in this chapter, we will look at the challenges of building culture in DevOps – specifically, the anti-patterns that can be blockers to culture. This is not an easy task and requires careful planning and thought.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Organizational alignment</li>
				<li>Resistance to change</li>
				<li>Difficulty scaling up</li>
				<li>Excessively focusing on tooling</li>
				<li>Legacy infrastructure and systems</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>Organizational alignment</h1>
			<p>Alignment <a id="_idIndexMarker242"/>across the organization is critical. Later in this chapter, we will talk about resistance to change, and when we should instigate change for the sake of it, without a clear vision or goals. This will create a high level of resistance in the organization. Alignment helps reduce resistance.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Increased competitive advantage, increased revenue, increased profits, and reduced costs are just some of the things to expect with better organizational alignment.</p>
			<p>Success with <a id="_idIndexMarker243"/>organizational alignment starts with answering the <em class="italic">what</em>, <em class="italic">why</em>, and <em class="italic">how</em>. Putting the appropriate measures in place at each step is what helps generate better alignment:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.1 – Organizational alignment to generate results</p>
			<p>Achieving alignment is fundamentally based on the three pillars of <strong class="bold">what</strong>, <strong class="bold">why</strong>, and <strong class="bold">how</strong>. The <em class="italic">what</em> phase revolves around making sure the mission statement is well defined. The strategy is also something that should be defined here as well. This is done by defining goals, objectives, and activities. A company mission statement is an example of defining <strong class="bold">what</strong>.</p>
			<p>Next, there's the <em class="italic">why</em>. Define your vision and the support structures that help the organization get there. Organizational structure is important here, as is the role of leadership and the processes that are used to help us achieve <em class="italic">why</em>. An example of this could be "<em class="italic">Our vision is to create better everyday lives for many people</em>." This could be the vision statement for a medical organization.</p>
			<p>In terms of <em class="italic">how</em>, this is the culture of the organization. Culture is made up of defining values, the practices within the business, and the behaviors we expect within our business.</p>
			<p>Putting all these together <a id="_idIndexMarker244"/>is what generates results. Vision also drives <em class="italic">what</em> and <em class="italic">how</em>. This concept is something that is explained very well by Simon Sinek in his session <em class="italic">Start with Why</em> (<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action">https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action</a>).</p>
			<p>That concludes our look at the effects of misalignment and how it can derail your DevOps transformation. Now, let's have a look at what resistance to change means for your organization.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor112"/>Resistance to change</h1>
			<p>Change <a id="_idIndexMarker245"/>happens – it is a frequent occurrence in any business. Sometimes, these changes are forced, while other times, they happen because of the need to change for the good of the business. Regardless of the scenario, in most organizations, we will likely come across resistance to change. If that resistance is not handled properly, our DevOps transformation can go off the rails before it's even begun.</p>
			<p>Therefore, it is critical to perform a DevOps transformation to understand how to deal with organizational change, understand the roles involved, and the steps needed to make it successful.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-114"><a id="_idTextAnchor113"/>Understanding the roles of organizational change</h2>
			<p>When navigating<a id="_idIndexMarker246"/> through DevOps transformation, for employees, this is a major change to the organization. When we are making any major change to how the organization operates, it is important to understand the roles of the two key players that make this happen successfully. These roles are management and <strong class="bold">human resources</strong> (<strong class="bold">HR</strong>).</p>
			<h3>Management</h3>
			<p>Leadership <a id="_idIndexMarker247"/>is critical in this situation. To avoid scenarios where employees become so dissatisfied with how changes are being handled that they leave, leadership and the executive team need to have unilateral support for the changes that are proposed.</p>
			<p>Conversations between managers and their teams, starting from a one-on-one basis, will help unify the team toward committing these changes. These conversations are crucial. It should be an open environment where we discuss how the changes affect them and what they think about the proposed changes.</p>
			<p>As managers, we should be asking the <strong class="bold">why</strong>, <strong class="bold">what</strong>, and <strong class="bold">how</strong> questions. Unfortunately, though, many managers are not well versed in organizational change management. This lack of skills can make it difficult to implement the changes required.</p>
			<p>To increase skills in this area, HR should provide appropriate training for managers, which will be useful for situations like this but also serve as good knowledge as managers further their careers up the management chain.</p>
			<h3>Human resources</h3>
			<p>In any <a id="_idIndexMarker248"/>organization, HR provides a pivotal role in implementing changes of any size. HR can provide communication, implementation, and tracking for any changes. The real value of HR comes with their ability to speak impartially with concerned employees about these changes, why the business is making them, and why employees are important to this change.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Whatever we do, we must make sure we engage HR in conversations from the beginning. They can only help when they understand the proposals, why we are proposing change, and how it will benefit the business.</p>
			<p>HR can help increase the buy-in of organizational change by championing the change and providing employees with the support that's needed across the various impacted teams. SHRM has two great resources that are worth looking at regarding this subject.</p>
			<p>The first one is <em class="italic">What is HR's role in Managing Change?</em> (<a href="https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/special-reports-and-expert-views/pages/deb-cohen.aspx">https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/special-reports-and-expert-views/pages/deb-cohen.aspx</a>), followed by <em class="italic">HR Can Improve Employee Buy-In for Organizational Change</em> (<a href="https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/organizational-and-employee-development/Pages/ImproveBuyIn.aspx">https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/organizational-and-employee-development/Pages/ImproveBuyIn.aspx</a>).</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>Organizational change process steps</h2>
			<p>When going <a id="_idIndexMarker249"/>through organizational change, to be successful, we should follow a methodical process. It's important to make sure we work with all the stakeholders from top to bottom in our organization to, well, ensure success.</p>
			<p>Let's have a look at the six key steps to achieving success in organizational change.</p>
			<h3>Clearly defining the change and aligning it with business goals</h3>
			<p>This may <a id="_idIndexMarker250"/>seem obvious, but many <a id="_idIndexMarker251"/>organizations don't do this well. It is one thing to articulate the change we are making, but it is another thing entirely to compare this against your organizational goals and performance objectives. This step is important because the right changes aligned with your business goals will move the business in the right direction. After all, that is why we are making the change in the first place.</p>
			<p>The other benefit to this step is that it allows us to evaluate the change we are proposing against the value it will bring. Why change if it doesn't bring sufficient value?</p>
			<p>We should be asking the following key questions at this stage to ensure we are getting the most value:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Why is the change needed?</li>
				<li>What do we need to change?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's learn how to determine the impact of change across the organization.</p>
			<h3>Determining impact across the organization</h3>
			<p>When we <a id="_idIndexMarker252"/>have determined the change we want to make and know it has real value, we should assess our organization and determine the impact it will have.</p>
			<p>It is important to understand that change does not just affect one business unit within your organization – change reverberates around the business and has a cascade effect for everyone. The information that's gathered here will be valuable in figuring out where training is needed and where employees need support.</p>
			<p>Some of the <a id="_idIndexMarker253"/>key questions that you should be answering at this stage are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How will change be received by employees?</li>
				<li>What are the impacts of the change?</li>
				<li>Who will the change affect the most?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, let's learn how to develop strong communication strategies to deliver our message of change.</p>
			<h3>Developing a strong communication strategy</h3>
			<p>It is key <a id="_idIndexMarker254"/>that everyone is part of the transformation journey. The first two steps will have told us about the employees that are directly affected and obviously must be included in any communication. However, transparency is key, so communicating with the whole business should be a focus of your communication strategy.</p>
			<p>Your strategy for communication should include a timeline on activities, the communication channels we want to use, the mediums we want to use to present the information, and how it will be communicated incrementally.</p>
			<p>We should be asking two key questions at this stage of our transformation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How will we manage feedback?</li>
				<li>How will change be communicated?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Training is a part of change that is often missed. Now, let's look at how to provide effective training.</p>
			<h3>Providing effective training</h3>
			<p>Now that our<a id="_idIndexMarker255"/> transformation message is out in the open and we understand the gaps in the organization, our employees need to know how training will be delivered and what training we will be providing.</p>
			<p>This is important because employees will want to know what skills they need in order to perform the roles under the proposed changes. Training could be provided in the form of online learning modules, classroom-led training, shadowing with subject matter experts, or mentoring.</p>
			<p>To provide effective training, ask the following questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Which training methods will be the most effective?</li>
				<li>What skills and behaviors are required to be successful?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Supporting <a id="_idIndexMarker256"/>employees through change is critical. Let's look at how we can provide support structures to employees.</p>
			<h3>Implementing an effective support structure</h3>
			<p>When<a id="_idIndexMarker257"/> going through any organizational change, it is important to develop a support structure for employees. Change can be unsettling for employees, so having an effective support structure can help overcome this.</p>
			<p>Effective support structures in organizational change will assist employees both emotionally and practically as the skills and behaviors needed for the role change. Mentorship, as well as having an open-door policy with leadership, is the critical thinking that's needed to allow employees to ask questions as they arise.</p>
			<p>Some of the key questions you should ask when implementing an effective support structure are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What types of support will be the most effective?</li>
				<li>What support is required the most?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Finally, let's look at how to measure the progress of change in our organization.</p>
			<h3>Measuring the progress</h3>
			<p>Finally, let's <a id="_idIndexMarker258"/>look at measurement. Throughout the process of organizational change, a structure should be put in place to measure the impact of the changes we are making throughout the business. This measurement step allows for continuous feedback and improvement along the way.</p>
			<p>This is also an opportunity to evaluate your change plan, determine how effective it is at what we are setting out to achieve, and document any lessons we are learning. We can also use this, if required, as an opportunity to tweak and change the plan. There is nothing worse than continuing with a flawed plan that will not lead to success. Don't be afraid to change as we go, should that tweak lead to success.</p>
			<p>The key<a id="_idIndexMarker259"/> questions we should be asking at this stage of the process are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Was the process successful?</li>
				<li>Did the change assist in achieving our business goals?</li>
				<li>What could we have done differently?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we understand the steps of organizational change, let's look at how to overcome resistance to change.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>Overcoming resistance</h2>
			<p>We have already discussed some steps we should be using during the change process. A lot of these things will help us overcome some of the resistance that we are facing.</p>
			<p>These won't help everyone, though, and communication, as we've mentioned previously, is crucial for getting this right. Constant communication to help with aligning our goals will help put people at ease. Resistance comes when people feel threatened or worried about changes that may occur.</p>
			<p>Some of the main<a id="_idIndexMarker260"/> reasons for resistance to change within an organization could be as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Fear of losing your job</li>
				<li>Poor communication</li>
				<li>Lack of trust</li>
				<li>Fear of the unknown</li>
				<li>Poor timing</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, let's look at these reasons in more detail.</p>
			<h3>Fear of losing your job</h3>
			<p>In every <a id="_idIndexMarker261"/>business, to stay competitive and to stay relevant with your customers, change is required. Sometimes, companies will need to<a id="_idIndexMarker262"/> add new roles, downsize, or even change roles to achieve these goals. For most people, this is where the fear of losing their job comes in.</p>
			<h3>Poor communication</h3>
			<p>I'm losing track of the number of times we say communication is important, but it really is, as it will make or break a transformational change. Communication solves all ills in a change, but lack of communication creates many.</p>
			<p>Employees need to clearly understand why change is needed and what it will help the business achieve. If employees are thrown the idea that "<em class="italic">everything they've been doing is wrong and it's going to completely change</em>," expect a huge backlash.</p>
			<h3>Lack of trust</h3>
			<p>Successful businesses are built upon trust. If the level of trust between leadership and employees on the ground is high, then your resistance is going to be low. However, in organizations with mutual distrust between leadership and employees, the business is not heading in the right direction, so successfully implementing your change will be very difficult.</p>
			<h3>Fear of the unknown</h3>
			<p>There is a saying in business: "<em class="italic">there are unknown unknowns</em>." When people don't know what is happening, that generates fear, which leads to resistance. This can easily be fixed with good communication. The more we communicate, the more open we are with our communication, which breaks down the fear of the unknown and builds trust. These two things alone will reduce the amount of resistance in your organization.</p>
			<h3>Poor timing</h3>
			<p>From experience, how and when the message of change is delivered is one of the key problems. It's usually not the act of change that creates resistance with employees, but how and when that change <a id="_idIndexMarker263"/>is communicated.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-117"><a id="_idTextAnchor116"/>Breakdown in communication</h2>
			<p>Communication <a id="_idIndexMarker264"/>is key, period. In my opinion, we cannot overcommunicate anything in business. When communication breaks down, it has a severe impact on business. This manifests itself in causing frustration in terms of money and time.</p>
			<p>Breakdowns happen when the communicator does not efficiently communicate what they are trying to say. This could be through spoken works, how those words are understood, or even written words. There is not just one way to break down communication. It could be the communicator who misspeaks or the recipient who does not interpret the communicator correctly.</p>
			<p>Business can take a lot from the aviation industry, where communication is of utmost importance. Failure to communicate clearly between pilots and air traffic control can result in huge losses of life. Throughout the history of aviation, the industry has learned from their mistakes and made the skies safer. We should do the same.</p>
			<p>Avoiding <a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>communication breakdowns in your business comes down to five key things. Let's have a look at them:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Owning mistakes</li>
				<li>Slowing down</li>
				<li>People coming together</li>
				<li>Winning people</li>
				<li>Patience</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's look at each of these in detail.</p>
			<h3>Owning mistakes</h3>
			<p>Humans have a fear of making mistakes, which can come from the fear of disappointing, previous mistakes that have been made, or other reasons. Owning your mistakes is important because shifting the blame to an innocent party is just going to make things worse.</p>
			<p>If we've misunderstood someone, we should just let them know. This helps correct the problem before it really becomes a problem. The communicator will then understand what went wrong and can improve their communication strategy next time.</p>
			<h3>Slowing down</h3>
			<p>Pace is<a id="_idIndexMarker266"/> important, so don't rush things. We can make breakdowns worse by rushing into resolutions. Shift the pace to moving more slowly; if we rush into things, people think it's not important, or that we want it out the way. When we slow down, that changes as we are taking the time to think about it, so it's important to solve.</p>
			<h3>People coming together</h3>
			<p>Above all, make sure your strategy is around bringing people together and not pushing them apart. Communication breakdowns divide people and destroy trust. Getting everyone on the same page – in the same room, if possible – and focused on the same goal starts to bring people closer together.</p>
			<h3>Winning people</h3>
			<p>Usually, when communication breaks down, some key people are responsible for that. Clearly, it should be around fixing the problem instead of playing a blame game. As we discussed earlier, blame just creates problems with trust.</p>
			<h3>Patience</h3>
			<p>Frustrating is a word we might use to describe communication breakdowns and getting out of them is quite difficult as well. We need to be patient, though: a lack of patience will only make things difficult.</p>
			<p>A lack of patience is often part of the cause of a communication breakdown and will only be remedied by acknowledging and enforcing it culturally. Sadly, resistance to change is all too common, but we can get through it! Now, let's move on and look at the difficulties of scaling up our DevOps transformation.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor117"/>Difficulty scaling up</h1>
			<p>One of the other<a id="_idIndexMarker267"/> anti-patterns in DevOps comes with the ability to scale up what we are doing. Most businesses will encounter issues in scaling up when they start out. With growth, especially rapid growth, comes challenges in scaling up your business.</p>
			<p>Scaling your business is difficult. Many changes are needed and can derail even the most successful business. Some challenges we can expect with scaling up are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Having to scale before market fit</li>
				<li>Working with the wrong people</li>
				<li>Focusing too much on sales and marketing</li>
				<li>Price competition</li>
				<li>Management structure as growth occurs</li>
				<li>Ignoring issues</li>
				<li>Forgetting making yourself lean is part of scaling</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All these challenges list are really from a business perspective, but what about scaling DevOps specifically? When it comes to scaling up, we need to stick to specific steps and focus on growing certain aspects of our DevOps practices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Start with small teams</li>
				<li>Encouraging skill development</li>
				<li>Prioritizing culture</li>
				<li>Continuous feedback</li>
				<li>Automation</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's have a look at these five areas in a little more detail to get an understanding of what we need to do.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor118"/>Start with small teams</h2>
			<p>Have <a id="_idIndexMarker268"/>you ever heard of the "<em class="italic">innovator's dilemma</em>"? It speaks to the challenges of innovating in your business when we are in a cycle of reality or our day-to-day operations. If we wish to scale, removing this impediment is fundamental to our success.</p>
			<p>We must decide on what we want to deliver, create an agile team to work on advocacy, and help scale our operations and remove blockers. We must acquire the skills we want in this team and work toward a logical resolution before moving the team into other teams.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-120"><a id="_idTextAnchor119"/>Encouraging skill development</h2>
			<p>This is where we introduce the growth mindset, or the learner's mindset. We must be willing to try something new and work with different teams. The mindset of the employees in these teams is crucial in starting out on the right foot.</p>
			<p>To get the best from both your developers and operations teams, encourage them to grow their skillsets – not just from a technology perspective, but also soft skills as well, which are equally important in DevOps.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>Prioritizing culture</h2>
			<p>Success in DevOps comes with developers and operations having a positive culture between both teams. It's easy to think that DevOps is all about developing products, but it is important to develop the right relationships. Culture is as important as other aspects of DevOps.</p>
			<p>The hard part is getting everyone onboard. Therefore, small teams are fundamental to starting this. Getting these things right will enable your teams to take on more as they develop. Teams that follow the early adopters will learn from them also.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/>Continuous feedback</h2>
			<p>Continuous feedback is a very important step in adapting your DevOps culture based on what is happening and how people are performing. The process of getting feedback enables us to understand what is happening with our product and what needs to change to make it better.</p>
			<p>Wherever possible, if we can, separate release from deployment. We can work toward iterated deployment, thereby getting feedback from our user base and incorporating those changes into future releases.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>Automation</h2>
			<p>Maturing your <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>automation capabilities will help you scale. When it comes to automation, find what hurts in your processes and look to automate this. However, don't focus too much on this; otherwise, we'll experience some of the things we will discuss in the <em class="italic">Excessively focusing on tooling</em> section.</p>
			<p>If we want to achieve continuous delivery, then we really need to be looking at automating our testing. Without automated testing in place, we are going to find it hard to perform continuous delivery.</p>
			<p>So far, we have looked at organizational reasons for anti-patterns in DevOps. Now, let's look at the effects of focusing too much on tooling.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-124"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>Excessively focusing on tooling</h1>
			<p>So far, I have touched on the <a id="_idIndexMarker270"/>importance of the other aspects of DevOps before focusing on tooling. The dangers of putting too much focus on tooling are evident from numerous studies we can find online.</p>
			<p>However, the reality is that we can focus on tooling too much compared to culture, people, and processes. Even after this point, you can excessively focus on tooling. This can damage your transformation efforts.</p>
			<p>One of the most common areas of technology in DevOps is around automation. This could be automating your CI/CD pipelines or other processes, be it technical or business. From my experience, though, many organizations take the message of automation in DevOps to an extreme – one that is counterproductive and sometimes harmful to businesses. That begs the question, how much automation is too much? Let's have a look.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>How much automation is too much?</h2>
			<p>It is important to understand how organizations get to this point. Let's imagine that most organizations are moving from a traditional waterfall methodology to an agile methodology, which is new to them. It's common to see organizations take agile to the extreme, which comes from overusing agile and, in turn, DevOps.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The key question should be, does automation serve the <em class="italic">what</em> and <em class="italic">why</em>?</p>
			<p>Research from <em class="italic">451 Research</em> (<a href="https://www.scriptrock.com/automation-enterprise-devops-doing-it-wrong">https://www.scriptrock.com/automation-enterprise-devops-doing-it-wrong</a>) shows a trend that backs this up:</p>
			<p class="author-quote">"I think there is a tendency to think that large enterprise organizations, with all their divisions and teams and silos, are capable of doing what Facebook or Netflix have done with their cutting-edge implementations of configuration management tools. All of the legacy technologies and processes have to be considered as well."</p>
			<p>                                            – <em class="italic">Jay Lyman</em>, <em class="italic">451 Research</em></p>
			<p>The toolchain is full of<a id="_idIndexMarker271"/> examples of organizations promising to make your organization the next Spotify or Netflix. While that is an admirable place to get to, fundamentally, your organization is neither Spotify nor Netflix and never will be.</p>
			<p>When we try and replicate the successes of these organizations from any perspective, but especially technology, we will quickly find ourselves on a downward path. Any investment we have made will, at this point, be worthless as we have tried to automate too much and push too much tooling.</p>
			<h3>Striking a balance</h3>
			<p>It is important to know and understand when to automate or implement a tool to achieve a specific thing. In fact, some organizations I have worked with in the past do no automation in DevOps; some do CI/CD automation, while others automate business processes.</p>
			<p>Automation is about taking a manual process and placing technology around parts of or the whole of a process so that this can be replicated through automation. The problem is that not all processes can or should be automated. Note that different parts of a process can be automated; it's not always about automating either the whole process or no part of the process.</p>
			<p>When we're deciding whether something should be automated, we should take a step back and follow a simple process. Let's put this into the context of software development processes:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Think about the processes that take place during development with the rest of team, vet them, and lock them.</li>
				<li>Decide on the tooling for automation.</li>
				<li>Look at the value of automation, step by step.<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p><p class="callout">If your processes are flawed to begin with, adding automation to them just makes a bad process happen faster and without oversight.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Your organization<a id="_idIndexMarker272"/> is also unique, and vendors have a habit of pulling us in with fancy marketing and telling us what they're doing with different software vendors. However, our organization has been selling books for 100 years. We're not a unicorn start-up and mixing old and new systems is going to be a challenge.</p>
			<h3>Breaking down processes</h3>
			<p>When it comes to our software development processes, we can start to break them down further. We can do this with any process – I'm just using software development as our working example.</p>
			<p>During this process, we break down our components into sub-processes. These are our candidates for automation. When we have sub-processes, we are in a perfect place to look at them in detail. At this point, can decide on whether we should keep, fix, or create new processes.</p>
			<p>It is important to take your time. Creating processes may seem trivial, but think about how the business wants to operate in the future and how it operates now. Processes must have the ability to grow with the organization through changes.</p>
			<p>DevOps-related enabler tasks such as CI, CD, or continuous testing should also be combined with any fixed processes at this point.</p>
			<p>Finally, you must select your tooling. This is where most organizations fall off the rails and things go wrong. When we have defined our processes and figured out which DevOps components will be integrated into them, we need to work on the right tooling for the job.</p>
			<p>Organizations that over-automate will typically focus on the actual tools rather than the process itself. Technology in this scenario is often based on emotions, such as other organizations using similar tools or their colleagues from a conference using them.</p>
			<p>This situation just <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>ends up in mass confusion for everyone involved. The result is too many tools and processes being used that must be adjusted for the tooling, when in fact your tooling should be adjusted for the processes.</p>
			<h3>When automation causes problems</h3>
			<p>I want to talk about an example I have come across. I worked with an organization that wanted to go from nothing to completely automating the life cycle. That way, developers could do everything end to end, at any time of the day. The grand vision was to enable the build anywhere, anytime scenario.</p>
			<p>However, the reality was that developers would release new code to the platform twice a day, sometimes more. The result of this behavior was that end users just became frustrated with the constant changes.</p>
			<p>For me, the nail in the coffin for this experiment was that the automated testing was not holistic. Quality issues that could have easily been resolved by humans doing some of the performance and regression testing slipped through the net.</p>
			<p>In the end, the organization removed some of the tools from the toolchain, limited the types of changes that could be made by the developers, and put more rigor around the review process, deployments, and, most importantly, testing.</p>
			<p>The moral of the story here is to not let grand plans and visions, along with the insatiable need to automate, overrule the part of us that applies rationale to how and why we automate.</p>
			<h3>Do no harm</h3>
			<p>I hope that, after reading the preceding sections, you are not put off by agile or DevOps. That certainly wasn't the intention. The fact remains that the value we can get from DevOps will far outweigh the cons of DevOps, but we must be smart and methodical about our implementation.</p>
			<p>Overall, technology is an enabler, and when used properly, it's something that adds a tremendous amount of value to your organization and can make the work we are doing much easier and more repeatable.</p>
			<p>The gold nirvana<a id="_idIndexMarker274"/> that is DevOps is something that comes over time through how we need to perform agile and the core DevOps principles in our organization, rather than how others do it. Many organizations can end up using tools to satisfy the vision of someone else rather than their own.</p>
			<p>In this section, we have looked at the effects of having an excessive focus on tooling. Now, let's move on and look at what legacy infrastructure and systems mean for DevOps.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-126"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>Legacy infrastructure and systems</h1>
			<p>Of course, DevOps is not just for the cloud; it can be for hybrid environments and, of course, on-premises. DevOps is arguably easier with cloud environments, but legacy infrastructure, systems, and thinking can be real blockers to DevOps.</p>
			<p>Legacy infrastructure<a id="_idIndexMarker275"/> causes several issues when it comes to DevOps adoption since these systems are not designed for the continuous processes that come with DevOps. Releasing in iterations with legacy infrastructure is also very difficult and, in some cases, impossible. This breaks the whole DevOps ethos and starts to introduce challenges we need to overcome.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-127"><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>Legacy modernization</h2>
			<p>One of the ways we<a id="_idIndexMarker276"/> deal with technical debt from legacy infrastructure is to go through a modernization process. This represents a journey from traditional infrastructure to more modern services, for the most part in a public cloud provider.</p>
			<p>Modernization has many benefits for businesses looking to scale as it helps reduce costs, improve customer experience, makes the time to market faster, and enables agility in the business, among other things.</p>
			<p>One of the most common routes to modernization is to move away from existing monolithic applications to a <strong class="bold">microservice</strong>-based architecture and design patterns. This pattern represents a domain-based architecture where services are decoupled from one another and can be reused for multiple purposes.</p>
			<p>Legacy applications and <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>infrastructure present several challenges to us:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Security</li>
				<li>Single point of failure</li>
				<li>Lack of flexibility</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The move toward more modern application principles and practices helps solve and address concerns in these areas. When it comes to processes and people, this is where DevOps can help. These are, of course, non-technical areas. These areas are as important as the technical areas when it comes to solving your legacy infrastructure concerns.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-128"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we explored the anti-patterns associated with culture in DevOps, looked at the challenges this brings to our DevOps transformation, and how to resolve some of these issues to prevent them from overburdening our efforts. Finally, we looked at the effects excessive tooling has on our environment and the dangers this brings to our efforts.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we'll look at value stream maps and learn how to use them to drive process change. We'll also look at the difference between value stream mapping and process maps.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-129"><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>Questions</h1>
