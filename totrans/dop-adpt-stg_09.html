			<h1 id="_idParaDest-131"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>Chapter 6</em>: Driving Process Change with Value Stream Maps</h1>
			<p>To fully understand processes, we must know who executes the process, when it is going to be executed, and why it is going to be executed. This information can help in breaking down processes and eliminating redundancies so that useful processes can be automated.</p>
			<p>This chapter will help you improve the process flow within your organization by reducing unnecessary processes using <strong class="bold">value stream mapping</strong>.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding value stream mapping</li>
				<li>How does value stream mapping help?</li>
				<li>Differences between process maps and value stream maps</li>
				<li>Explaining an example value stream map</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>Understanding value stream mapping</h1>
			<p>The process of value stream mapping comes from value stream management. In turn, value stream <a id="_idIndexMarker278"/>management is a lean business practice that aims to understand the value of software development, delivery, and resources.</p>
			<p>This process can also help the flow of value within an organization, while also providing life cycle management for software delivery. With value stream mapping, instead of teams focusing on features, this can help your teams focus on what works and start to shift away from things that do not work.</p>
			<p>So far, we have looked heavily at the cultural aspects of DevOps and what it means for your organization with respect to their transformational journey toward DevOps best practices. This chapter will start to focus on the processes within your organization. Processes that are lean are processes that work well, contain very little waste, and are highly efficient. Once you have achieved this level of efficacy with your processes, you can start to automate.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Automating bad processes implies that you make bad processes happen faster. Apply lean practices to them first, such as value stream mapping, to make them as efficient as possible.</p>
			<p>Going through a value stream mapping exercise offers a plain and simple view of your processes from the perspective of customer experience. The result of this is better alignment with <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>business objectives and the ability to scale agile and DevOps transformation.</p>
			<p>The first step in this process is about changing your mindset, so that you look at software development as a direct link to business goals. We've spoken about the changes that are required several times already. The same can be said when we're trying to make our processes lean.</p>
			<p>Activities you perform in software development and business goals are often given a wide berth from each other, and the different priorities of software teams keep them caught up in those priorities. In this scenario, where nobody is aligned, you must take a step back to see if you are in alignment.</p>
			<p>So, the first logical step is to take a pause and back up a little. Evaluate what is happening in the business, and then look at how the work you are doing in software development is helping and supporting the business in achieving its goals.</p>
			<p>During this process, evaluate where you are with the people, processes, tools involved, and any dependencies that exist so that leadership has complete visibility into how things are going.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>Going beyond DevOps for process improvement</h2>
			<p>It is true that DevOps has accounted for a huge amount of organizational change and transformation <a id="_idIndexMarker280"/>within the software industry. This has evolved over time, from the initial focus on teamwork and empathy, to how we can drive real value to the organization.</p>
			<p>As we have discussed already, to get the best return on investment, you must focus on the business value you are generating and the customer satisfaction that comes with this. This was something we discussed in <a href="B17192_02_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor038"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Business Benefits, Team Topologies, and Pitfalls of DevOps</em>.</p>
			<p>For many organizations, they would agree that DevOps has provided a large amount of transformation. However, you will still find a number of enterprises that fail to understand and explain the value that is achieved from the investment required.</p>
			<p>As your <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>practice matures, you need to focus more on understanding and creating metrics and KPIs to measure success. These metrics should increase the quality of any software you deliver further and speed up delivery to satisfy customer experience, as well as show the business value you are delivering.</p>
			<p>The key message here is that successfully implementing DevOps will help a tremendous amount, but you must go much further in your level of process maturity.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>Taking a look at value stream mapping diagrams</h2>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker282"/>diagram is from an article on value stream mapping from Plutora (<a href="https://www.plutora.com/blog/value-stream-mapping">https://www.plutora.com/blog/value-stream-mapping</a>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer027" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_06_01.jpg" alt="Figure 6.1 – Example diagram from a value stream mapping exercise&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.1 – Example diagram from a value stream mapping exercise</p>
			<p>We will look at the preceding diagram in more detail later in this chapter. The previous example is some output from a value stream mapping exercise.</p>
			<p>The value <a id="_idIndexMarker283"/>stream map is a diagram that is split into three primary areas. These areas are information flow, product flow, and time ladder.</p>
			<h3>Information flow</h3>
			<p>This section of the <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>diagram shows how any information related to the process communicates, as well as how data is transmitted. The diagram shows the release manager <a id="_idIndexMarker285"/>taking in all customer requests. Only approved requests are submitted to the development queue, which is shown as a supplier.</p>
			<p>Depending on the goal of the value stream mapping exercise, the collection and distribution processes shown in SharePoint and Excel can include numerous levels of detail, as well as a number of other integrated systems.</p>
			<h3>Product flow</h3>
			<p>This section looks to map the steps of the software development life cycle all the way from the initial <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/>concept through to delivery. Depending on your requirements, you can focus on <a id="_idIndexMarker287"/>specific parts of the process if you are looking to gain efficiencies at specific points. It can be as detailed or as high level as needed.</p>
			<p>The task that is being performed is shown in the box, as is the individual or team performing the task in the box. Key process data is then shown below this. The example in the preceding diagram shows two items. C/T refers to cycle time, while S/T refers to setup time.</p>
			<p>You can include any number of details at this point that highlight any important information <a id="_idIndexMarker288"/>you wish to show. Triangles show the queue of features that are waiting at each stage of the process, followed by dotted arrows from one stage to another. These are called <strong class="bold">push arrows</strong>. These show that the product is being moved from one stage to another, as opposed to being pulled.</p>
			<h3>Time ladder</h3>
			<p>The purpose of the <a id="_idIndexMarker289"/>time ladder is to provide a really high-level or simplistic view of the timeline involved in the value stream. The top portion of the ladder represents the average amount <a id="_idIndexMarker290"/>of time that your feature will spend in a queue, gate, or waiting at each stage in the process.</p>
			<p>The bottom portion of the ladder shows the average amount of time where active work is engaged. More specifically, it shows you when value has been added to the feature during that specific stage.</p>
			<h3>Other terminology</h3>
			<p>Let's look at <a id="_idIndexMarker291"/>some of the other terminology you may come across in value stream mapping diagrams:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cycle time</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker292"/>refers to the frequency of features that are produced, or the average time between two completed features.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Setup time</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>refers to the amount of time needed to prepare for any given step. In software engineering, this could be the time needed to understand requirements.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Uptime</strong>: This is <a id="_idIndexMarker294"/>measured as a percentage and provides you with the total time that any processes or systems are active.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lead time</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker295"/>measures the average time needed for one request to make its way through the entire cycle from concept to delivery. We discussed this in <a href="B17192_03_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor071"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Measuring the Success of DevOps</em>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Takt time</strong>: This is the <a id="_idIndexMarker296"/>rate you need in order to produce features to meet customer demand. It's a calculation that takes the number of hours in a working day, multiplied by the number of working days in a month, divided by the number of work hours available, converted into minutes per month. Based on 9,000 minutes in a month and 150 features from your customers, dividing those means you have 60 minutes <a id="_idIndexMarker297"/>or less to complete each of those features to keep up with the volume.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's now look at the symbols used in value stream diagrams.</p>
			<h3>Value stream symbols</h3>
			<p>You will notice some specific symbols in <em class="italic">Figure 6.1</em>. Much like a flowchart, these represent <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>specific things. Let's look at the symbols you can use within your value stream diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer028" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_06_02.jpg" alt="Figure 6.2 – Symbols used in value stream diagrams&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.2 – Symbols used in value stream diagrams</p>
			<p>Of course, many more exist, but the ones included in the diagram are common, and you will certainly need to use them in your own value stream maps. You can also group them into categories. The top row includes all the material flow symbols, the second row includes information flow symbols, and the bottom row includes a general set.</p>
			<p>Now, let's discuss <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>the key terms involved in material flow, information flow, and process flow diagrams in detail.</p>
			<h4>Material flow</h4>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>terminology is commonly used in material flow diagrams:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Process</strong>: Represents <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/>a single individual or team performing a specific task.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Shared Process</strong>: The <a id="_idIndexMarker302"/>same as a regular process, but the process is shared between numerous parties.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Supplier/Customer</strong>: Generally, when this is in the upper left of a value stream, this <a id="_idIndexMarker303"/>is the starting place of the flow and indicates a supplier. When it's in the upper right, it represents the customer.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inventory</strong>: Use <a id="_idIndexMarker304"/>this if you want to add an inventory count between two processes. As in our example, we put the number of features outstanding at that point in time.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Information flow</h4>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker305"/>terminology is commonly used in information flow diagrams:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Manual flow</strong>: Indicates <a id="_idIndexMarker306"/>where conversations or notes are passed and the type of information that's flowing.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Electronic flow</strong>: The <a id="_idIndexMarker307"/>same as a manual flow, but it represents an electronic information asset.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Signal Kanban</strong>: This is <a id="_idIndexMarker308"/>used when the inventory drops to a minimum and signals the production of several parts. Think supermarket stock levels.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kanban Post</strong>: Typically, this <a id="_idIndexMarker309"/>indicates a location for collecting signals. It can also be used to exchange withdrawal and production in Kanban.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>General</h4>
			<p>You may <a id="_idIndexMarker310"/>also need to use the following in your diagrams:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Operator</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker311"/>shows how many operators are needed to process the value stream map at a specific step.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kaizen Burst</strong>: Sometimes <a id="_idIndexMarker312"/>called a <strong class="bold">Kaizen Blitz</strong>, this is a burst <a id="_idIndexMarker313"/>of team activity focused on resolving specific challenges. Its purpose is to resolve the challenge and focus the team on a problem.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Quality Burst</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker314"/>indicates a problem in quality and can be used at any point in the value stream mapping chain.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Safety Stock</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker315"/>indicates a temporary safety stock to prevent problems, should a failure occur, or if other issues are present.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we understand some of the fundamentals of value stream mapping, let's look at how value stream mapping can help within your organization. Some of the terminology we've used so far has been a little generic, so let's make examples more specific to software engineering.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>How does value stream mapping help?</h1>
			<p>Value stream mapping is incredibly important. Not only does it help you understand your processes, but it also helps translate that understanding into methods that improve <a id="_idIndexMarker316"/>your processes. It is critical to business sustainability.</p>
			<p>There are three reasons for this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Eliminating waste improves the bottom line for your organization. You also discover the root cause and source of waste using this process.</li>
				<li>Teams will discard individual assumptions and prioritize them based on the perspective of the customer.</li>
				<li>Wasteful handoffs can be identified easily through visualizations that have been created with value stream mapping. Teams can identify and react to improve their collaboration, communication, and culture.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>While the process of creating value stream maps can be incredibly useful to your organization, it can also present some challenges. Let's look at these challenges in more detail.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>Challenges of value stream mapping</h2>
			<p>Value stream mapping can be a wasteful exercise if you are not careful about how you execute it. You need to be aware of common pitfalls that exist, including creating value stream maps <a id="_idIndexMarker317"/>and making sure that what you produce is itself of value to your business.</p>
			<p>Return on investment is crucial when it comes to value stream mapping. Monitor the level of effort you need to invest to conduct a value stream map for a process and balance that against any potential value you get from it. Keep an eye on your return on investment from the start.</p>
			<p>The process of identifying waste can be intensive. It's common to come across fear and uncertainty when employees know value stream mapping is occurring. They wrongly assume this process is used to identify waste from an employee perspective.</p>
			<p>Many processes involve cross-functional teams and several other complexities. You should make sure you involve people that are experienced from all sides of the process when conducting value stream maps.</p>
			<p>While baby steps are a fantastic place to start making savings by improving steps here and there, these step improvements may not impact the overall bottom line until top-to-bottom changes are completed.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Remember, the goal of value stream mapping is to cut waste, not create any more than what you already have.</p>
			<p>We discussed the <a id="_idIndexMarker318"/>symbols you can use in value stream mapping exercises earlier in this chapter. My advice would be not to rush to professional solutions to create them. Start off by using paper or a whiteboard; the results are the same and you can outline your idea. You can formalize the value stream map later using software to achieve this.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Use cases of value stream mapping</h2>
			<p>Based on the descriptions of some of the symbols we looked at earlier in this chapter, you will hopefully have guessed that, like many lean processes that come from manufacturing, value stream mapping has its roots not in software engineering, nor in technology, but in manufacturing.</p>
			<p>Value stream <a id="_idIndexMarker319"/>mapping can bring value to several industries. The principals apply equally to each of them, and you can adapt to your needs like in any framework. Fundamentally, the industry or domain that you are operating on determines the items that flow through the value stream map.</p>
			<p>For example, when it comes to supply chains, value stream mapping is essential to finding and eliminating costly delays, which leads up to the finished product. In the services industry, the process will facilitate timely services for customers, as well as effective services.</p>
			<p>In healthcare, value stream mapping will ensure that patients receive high-quality care while reducing any delays that could be life-threatening. Finally, in manufacturing, value stream mapping helps identify waste by analyzing each step of both the material and information flows. Process items, which flow through the value stream, are called materials.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Identifying and reducing waste</h2>
			<p>As we mentioned in the previous section, value stream mapping originated in manufacturing, just like the lean principals themselves. Lean has its origins in the automotive <a id="_idIndexMarker320"/>industry in Japan. This enabled the <a id="_idIndexMarker321"/>Japanese car industry to flourish through lean principles and automation while the rest of the world was still catching up.</p>
			<p>Applying that lean thinking to your day-to-day processes is harder than you might think. In the manufacturing industry, the following eight things are wastes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Defects</li>
				<li>Overproduction</li>
				<li>Waiting</li>
				<li>Non-utilized talent</li>
				<li>Transport</li>
				<li>Inventory</li>
				<li>Motion</li>
				<li>Extra-processing</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When applying lean thinking, try thinking about the eight things in the preceding list to see where you can make improvements to your processes. Let's run through some examples in software development that can help you identify waste.</p>
			<h3>Transport</h3>
			<p>In manufacturing, we think <a id="_idIndexMarker322"/>of transport as something physical: moving from one place to another. Transport is probably one of the hardest types of waste you can discover in software development. After all, the product is not something physical that you move – it is something virtual.</p>
			<p>Instead of thinking physically, think about how your tasks are going from one developer to the next. This could be from an architect to a developer, or a designer to a developer.</p>
			<p>A practical example of this could be developer to tester. Let's assume that your tester is ready to work on your task and they've just finished working on another, so that it can be worked <a id="_idIndexMarker323"/>on immediately. First, the tester will look at the task to understand what they need to do. Next, you must start the application and get to the step you want them to test. It can take time for them to get to that point. This is what is called setup time and, in this example, that time is generated by the handover.</p>
			<h3>Waiting</h3>
			<p>Waste in terms of <a id="_idIndexMarker324"/>waiting can be found with <strong class="bold">work in progress</strong> (<strong class="bold">WIP</strong>), as well as waiting for the next step <a id="_idIndexMarker325"/>in the process. If you are waiting, then that work is not getting processed efficiently. Tasks that wait on someone or something else provide non-value-added time. This delays delivery, not just of that item but all items.</p>
			<p>Good examples of this in the software engineering area would be quality control steps such as testing, as well as technical debt and bug fixes.</p>
			<h3>Overproduction</h3>
			<p>In software development, this comes in two clear forms. The first will be very familiar to you, and this <a id="_idIndexMarker326"/>is scope creep. To clarify, scope creep is when you start off with an initial set of requirements, but after you start working on those requirements, they change.</p>
			<p>The second type of <a id="_idIndexMarker327"/>overproduction comes into play along with the <strong class="bold">Pareto principle</strong>. The application of this principle is that 80% of your target audience will only use around 20% of your features. Therefore, this principle dictates you will spend a large amount of time developing features that will hardly be used.</p>
			<p>Now that we understand why value stream mapping is so important and understand how to identify waste, let's have a look at the differences between process maps and value stream mapping.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>Analyzing differences between process maps and value stream maps</h1>
			<p>Value stream mapping shows a significant amount of information and uses a more linear format. It is <a id="_idIndexMarker328"/>very different from a <a id="_idIndexMarker329"/>process map, which only shows the steps involved in the process. The same differences also apply to flowcharts, as shown in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer029" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_06_03.jpg" alt="Figure 6.3 – High-level diagram showing some of the elements of a flowchart&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.3 – High-level diagram showing some of the elements of a flowchart</p>
			<p>As you can see, a flowchart or process map does a great job of showing the parts of the process, including the points of decision throughout the process. However, it does not go that step further as a value stream map does.</p>
			<p>Value stream mapping attempts to identify waste within processes and between process <a id="_idIndexMarker330"/>steps. Process mapping, on <a id="_idIndexMarker331"/>the other hand, forms a more detailed picture of the business process.</p>
			<p>Take the following example diagram from <em class="italic">Creately</em> (<a href="https://creately.com/blog/diagrams/process-mapping-guide/">https://creately.com/blog/diagrams/process-mapping-guide/</a>). The following process map diagram clearly shows the different parts of the process:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer030" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_06_04.jpg" alt="Figure 6.4 – Example of a process map with swim lanes&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.4 – Example of a process map with swim lanes</p>
			<p>The preceding diagram shows what are known as swim lanes. These are the vertical columns you can see. In the previous example, they separate parts of the process into different people who interact with the process. You have the customer, front office, and technician in the preceding diagram.</p>
			<p>This is useful for highlighting who deals with the parts of the process you are documenting; it can move in and out of different swim lanes, and the number of swim lanes you have on a diagram is entirely dependent on the process.</p>
			<p>The following diagram, also from <em class="italic">Creately</em>, is a simpler example of a process map. It's simply read from left to right, following the arrows:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer031" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_06_05.jpg" alt="Figure 6.5 – Simple example of a process map&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.5 – Simple example of a process map</p>
			<p>The regular <a id="_idIndexMarker332"/>boxes are steps in the <a id="_idIndexMarker333"/>process where something happens, while the rounded pill shapes are initiators and terminators – in other words, where you start and stop the process.</p>
			<p>When to use either a process map or a value stream map is clearly something critical that you need to understand. You can spend lots of time creating both process maps and value stream maps and get the wrong result if you are not careful.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Which should I use?</h2>
			<p>You can take advantage of both process maps and value stream maps, obviously due to the difference <a id="_idIndexMarker334"/>in the level of detail that's <a id="_idIndexMarker335"/>produced, so you want to make sure you create the right thing for the right reasons. Each type of map is used to identify different variables along the way, but there is value in combining the components of value streams with the detailed elements of process maps.</p>
			<p>A detailed process map, if you think about it, does have all the elements of a value stream map – it can also be broken down into much greater detail.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">When your value stream map has identified waste, consider using a process map to include a much greater level of detail.</p>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker336"/>next section, we'll understand <a id="_idIndexMarker337"/>the difference between process mapping and value stream mapping. Let's finish this chapter by looking at an example of a value stream map and look at what we can do to improve our processes.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>Explaining an example value stream map</h1>
			<p>So far in this chapter, we have looked at what value stream maps are, how they can help your business, and, at a high level, the components involved in your value stream map. Now, we'll start <a id="_idIndexMarker338"/>looking at how to build value stream maps, while also looking at the before and after states of DevOps processes.</p>
			<p>The process of creating a value stream map that is meaningful can be a lengthy process, depending on how big the process is. As we discussed earlier, make sure you are getting something out of the process by monitoring your return on investment from your value stream mapping activities.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Creating a value stream map</h2>
			<p>When you <a id="_idIndexMarker339"/>start to create a value stream map, you should follow the following steps to ensure you are successful. It can be a tough task, creating a value stream map for the first time. Follow these steps and tips along the way and you will be able to produce value stream maps of true value.</p>
			<h3>Determining the problem to be solved</h3>
			<p>First, you need to determine what problem you are trying to solve. Don't try to map a value stream just because you want to make a diagram – create your value stream map from something where a problem exists.</p>
			<p>To give <a id="_idIndexMarker340"/>you some insight into this, think of problem solving from your customer's perspective. Do they feel it takes you too long to deliver new features? Everyone will need to be on the same page, so make sure you publish your problem statement.</p>
			<p>Finally, set some goals. It's not realistic to say you want to reduce it by a specific percentage; it's an admirable goal, but make sure it's realistic.</p>
			<h3>Ensuring the team is empowered</h3>
			<p>When working through value stream maps, you need a team that's both experienced and mature. This <a id="_idIndexMarker341"/>will help them navigate the task at hand and, most importantly, complete it in a timely manner. Leadership should also set aside the budget required to ensure that execution is in line with expectations.</p>
			<h3>Bounding the process</h3>
			<p>Once you have completed and published your problem statement, it is important to limit the scope <a id="_idIndexMarker342"/>of your value stream mapping exercise. You may not need to map the entire process end to end; you may only need to focus on a specific part of the process.</p>
			<p>This process of breaking down complex processes into smaller parts and then breaking them down even more until the complexity is rendered in understandable, discreet components is known as process decomposition.</p>
			<p>I would recommend this approach overall; you will get better results from experience by focusing on part of the problem rather than everything top to bottom. Tackle the full process in stages rather than end to end.</p>
			<p>Once you have bounded your efforts to a part of the process, make sure you map it by conducting a review. Experience cannot be substituted by biased, incomplete, or even inaccurate documentation or narrative by others.</p>
			<p>Define the steps of the process; complete this multiple times. Sometimes, things come out on the <a id="_idIndexMarker343"/>second or even third pass. Make sure you do this at least twice to ensure you get a complete picture.</p>
			<h3>Collecting process data and creating a timeline</h3>
			<p>While you are conducting your value stream mapping exercise, note down any applicable <a id="_idIndexMarker344"/>process data you wish to collect. This may <a id="_idIndexMarker345"/>include, but is certainly not limited to, the following information:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Number of people involved</li>
				<li>Average working hours</li>
				<li>Cycle time</li>
				<li>Wait time</li>
				<li>Uptime</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Also, make sure that you include your process times and lead times at the bottom. Remember earlier when I explained what the time ladder is used for? This is where it comes in.</p>
			<h3>Assessing the current value stream map</h3>
			<p>When you start to assess your current value stream map, look for specific things at this stage of <a id="_idIndexMarker346"/>the process. Ask the following questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Do teams have multiple dependencies?</li>
				<li>Is your wait time or lead time too long?</li>
				<li>Might this be because your testing does not run in parallel?</li>
				<li>Is your environment stable?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All these questions can be used to evaluate your value stream map. It could even be that you have valuable steps in your process, but they don't transpire into anything meaningful to the customer. You should also be looking for any drag in the process or stagnation within the information flow. Make a note of whether this is either a push or a pull.</p>
			<h3>Designing your future state</h3>
			<p>At this stage, your value stream map may not be completed or a final version, but that's fine. The important <a id="_idIndexMarker347"/>thing here is to ensure that the value stream map for your future state aligns with your organization's vision for the future.</p>
			<p>Make sure nothing is set in stone. In the spirit of DevOps as well, ensure you can incorporate continuous feedback into this process and make any adjustments that make sense.</p>
			<h3>Implementing your future state</h3>
			<p>You must <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>validate that your future <a id="_idIndexMarker349"/>state is going to make the differences you envisage. Monitor your <strong class="bold">objectives and key results</strong> (<strong class="bold">OKRs</strong>), as well as your <strong class="bold">key performance indicators</strong> (<strong class="bold">KPIs</strong>), to learn from the trends you are seeing. We discussed <a id="_idIndexMarker350"/>metrics in <a href="B17192_03_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor071"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Measuring the Success of DevOps</em>, which can be used to make KPIs.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The goal of a successful value stream mapping exercise is ensuring that everyone is now pointing and working in the same direction: that of the customer.</p>
			<p>Of course, all of this should have fixed the problem you set out in the problem statement you defined at the beginning. If you cannot say it has, then go back and look at what else can be done to make the situation better.</p>

			<p>Now, let's look at a real example of what value stream maps look like in the DevOps world. Take a look <a id="_idIndexMarker351"/>at the following diagram, which is a template from <em class="italic">Lucidchart</em> (<a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/examples/value-stream-mapping-software">https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/examples/value-stream-mapping-software</a>) that perfectly illustrates the value you can get:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.6 – Current value stream map of our DevOps processes</p>
			<p>I want to take a little bit of time to explain what is happening in this diagram. First, let's discuss the process in a few words. You can see that our customer section is the main point of ingress.</p>
			<p>It starts with the customer sending a feature request via email. This is picked up by one of two service engineers. At this point, they log that request into Confluence. The one product manager in the team then approves and prioritizes the feature request in Jira.</p>
			<p>Then, our software <a id="_idIndexMarker352"/>engineering team of two people will work on that item in Java using the details from the request in <em class="italic">Jira</em>. That code is then deployed into pre-production by one deployment engineer using <em class="italic">Jenkins</em> and <em class="italic">Circle CI</em>. Then, using <em class="italic">Selenium</em>, QA is completed by QA specialists and the customer. Finally, one deployment engineer is responsible for pulling all the development effort together to release to production.</p>
			<p>The total lead time for this process is 243 hours, while the total value-added time (the time spent on a task) is 26.08 hours. <strong class="bold">%C&amp;A</strong> refers to the output that is complete and accurate, while <strong class="bold">Rolled %C&amp;A</strong> (24%) refers to the time that does not need to be reworked. Finally, the <strong class="bold">activity ratio</strong>, at 11%, is the time spent working.</p>
			<p>Overall, while <a id="_idIndexMarker353"/>the process is well-defined and mapped out well, you can see several areas of improvement. Let's look at these areas.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>Future state value stream map</h2>
			<p>Future state does not always have to be about removing steps from your process. Remember <a id="_idIndexMarker354"/>that it is about making efficiency savings for your process. Look at the following future state value stream map:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer033" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_06_07.jpg" alt="Figure 6.7 – Future state value stream map for our DevOps processes&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.7 – Future state value stream map for our DevOps processes</p>
			<p>Before I get into the details of what has changed with our future state, please see the dots above the top right of the process boxes, which indicate that a process is new. As I just mentioned, this is not about cutting process steps but adding them if this adds value.</p>
			<p>Next, under each process, the time data shown includes arrows pointing right to indicate no change. You will add these if you introduce a new process. The arrows pointing down indicate a decrease in time from the previous value stream map or current process, while arrows pointing up indicate an increase in time.</p>
			<p>So, let's have a look at what has changed. First, let's look at the new processes. Here, you can see that instead of having the customer send across an email with their new requirement, this is now fulfilled by the direct addition to <strong class="bold">Confluence</strong>. The product manager will now review and approve/prioritize the request, resulting in time being saved.</p>
			<p>This also results in a reduction in lead time for the developers to complete their development effort, which is now down to 96 hours lead time and 11 minutes for completing the actual task.</p>
			<p>In fact, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker355"/>see savings across several different tasks in the process and the introduction of new testing processes, as well as monitoring the code. All this means that the total lead time is now 188 hours, down from 243 hours.</p>
			<p>The value added time is now 19.54 hours, down from 26.08 hours. We have reduced the amount of time people are working on value, which isn't a bad thing. This means they can deliver more with the time they have. Introducing testing and monitoring makes delivery more mature, but above all, increases the customer's interaction with us.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we looked at the process of value stream mapping, understood what it is, how it can help us, and how to build a value stream map. We also looked at the difference between value stream maps and process maps, discussed the different types of process waste you can identify in your processes, and finally looked at an example of how to create a value stream map.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will look at how to take what you have learned in this chapter and apply that to delivering process change in your organization. We'll do this by looking at eight steps for change, the effects of process change, and common challenges within process change.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Questions</h1>
