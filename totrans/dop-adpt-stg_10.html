			<p>Now that you understand your processes and what needs to be changed, this chapter looks at how to manage process change across your organization. Remember that sometimes processes affect multiple teams and departments. This can be a challenge and needs to be carefully managed to ensure success.</p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will be able to understand the eight steps of effective process change, the different models of business change, and the common challenges of process change.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Eight steps for effective change</li>
				<li>Models for business change</li>
				<li>People effects of process change</li>
				<li>The common challenges of process change</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Eight steps for effective change</h1>
			<p>In business, the need to change is fairly constant. Businesses that adapt to change effectively are <a id="_idIndexMarker356"/>ones that come out on top in the long run and beat their competition. When you have mapped out processes and completed value stream maps, your next task to undertake is to look at how to effectively deliver that change in your organization.</p>
			<p>This starts with an eight-step plan for change, the steps of which can be described as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Identifying what can be improved</li>
				<li>Presenting a business case to stakeholders</li>
				<li>Planning for change</li>
				<li>Identifying resources and data for evaluation</li>
				<li>Communicating</li>
				<li>Evaluating resistance, dependencies, and risk</li>
				<li>Celebrating success</li>
				<li>Continuously improving</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Some of these <a id="_idIndexMarker357"/>steps will be familiar to you already, since we have already discussed a few of them, but let's now have a look at them all in detail.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Identifying what will be improved</h2>
			<p>I have included this step here purely for completeness. For clarity, we covered this in the previous chapter, when <a id="_idIndexMarker358"/>talking about value stream maps, and discussed at length how to identify what needs to be improved and when something should be improved.</p>
			<p>Knowing what you need to change will create a strong base for the successful implementation of a change to your process.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Presenting a business case to stakeholders</h2>
			<p>Presenting a business case to your stakeholders is the next step. However, this step might <a id="_idIndexMarker359"/>not be needed depending on how you have gone about gathering support for your change in process so far.</p>
			<p>If you have already engaged your stakeholders and walked them through the problem statement and how it can be fixed, then you have essentially presented your business case.</p>
			<p>Depending on the type of change and the impact on the wider business, don't be surprised if you find you have to present your idea to wider stakeholders to gather wider support.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Planning for change</h2>
			<p>Lots of people think that when you have your completed value stream map, you are good to go. Before <a id="_idIndexMarker360"/>you do anything, plan how you are going to implement your change. You stand a greater chance of success if you put the work into planning first.</p>
			<p>It may be a small change you are making, but still set yourself clear goals about what success will look like when your change is implemented. It also goes without saying that if your change is large and touches numerous parts of your organization, then planning is key.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>Identifying resources and data for evaluation</h2>
			<p>This step is part of your planning. Ensure you have the right resources to execute efficiently. Think about more than just people when it comes to resources. This could be additional <a id="_idIndexMarker361"/>software, training, tools, or documentation changes to name a few.</p>
			<p>Data comes down to how you evaluate progress and success. Having appropriate data means you can provide data-informed updates on your progress and hopefully your success, rather than a feeling or gut instinct.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-153"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>Communicating</h2>
			<p>Communication is the real key to success. It is the golden nugget that most change management <a id="_idIndexMarker362"/>frameworks have in common with each other. It runs through the entire practice of change management. It is that important.</p>
			<p>Clear and open lines of communication are fundamental to your success in delivering process change. Communication methods allow you to have avenues to vent frustrations, celebrate what is working, and review what is not. Finally, communication is a key enabler of transparency that keeps everyone onside.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-154"><a id="_idTextAnchor153"/>Evaluating resistance, dependencies, and risk</h2>
			<p>One <a id="_idIndexMarker363"/>of the <a id="_idIndexMarker364"/>biggest <a id="_idIndexMarker365"/>risks to the success of your change is resistance. It's normal and occurs in every organization. The majority of resistance occurs because of fear of the unknown. More generically, there is a level of risk associated with every change you make. Maybe it won't have the desired effects.</p>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker366"/>navigate <a id="_idIndexMarker367"/>resistance <a id="_idIndexMarker368"/>by arming your team and leadership with tools and knowledge to aid in a smooth transition.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-155"><a id="_idTextAnchor154"/>Celebrating success</h2>
			<p>Recognize the small incremental changes along the way as well as the final success. Each step you make <a id="_idIndexMarker369"/>in the right direction is a positive one and each step should be celebrated. Your team will be working hard to make this successful, and celebrating their success and recognizing their efforts will keep people going, especially if the change is over a long period of time.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-156"><a id="_idTextAnchor155"/>Continuously improving</h2>
			<p>Change management can be very difficult, as it is an ongoing process that needs tweaking <a id="_idIndexMarker370"/>when appropriate to help ensure success. <strong class="bold">Continuous improvement</strong> should be threaded through the entire process, just like communication. This can help you identify and resolve roadblocks along the way.</p>
			<p>Now that we have explored these eight steps in more detail, let's look at some change management models you can use in your organization.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-157"><a id="_idTextAnchor156"/>Models for business change</h1>
			<p>Many frameworks exist for executing change within your business, and like all frameworks, some <a id="_idIndexMarker371"/>will fit your business better than others. Some are for specific scenarios. You should never try to fit your business to the framework; rather, fit the framework to your business.</p>
			<p>In this section, we are going to take a look at four business change models, how they can be used, and what they teach us. You may even take elements from multiple frameworks and put them into your own. The frameworks are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kotter's change management model</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Rogers' tech adoption curve</strong></li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, Reinforcement</strong> (<strong class="bold">ADKAR</strong>) model</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Envision, Activate, Support, Implement, Ensure, Recognize</strong> (<strong class="bold">EASIER</strong>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's look <a id="_idIndexMarker372"/>at each of these models in more detail.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-158"><a id="_idTextAnchor157"/>Kotter's change management model</h2>
			<p>The first <a id="_idIndexMarker373"/>model is Kotter's <a id="_idIndexMarker374"/>change management model. This is the brainchild of <em class="italic">Dr. John Kotter</em> (<a href="https://www.kotterinc.com/team/john-kotter">https://www.kotterinc.com/team/john-kotter</a>), who is an author and management consultant; he is a thought leader in business, leadership, and change and is the founder of Kotter International, which applies Kotter's leadership research to help organizations execute large-scale change. Like the model discussed earlier in this chapter, Kotter's model is also an eight-step model, which is split into three phases. These phases are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Creating the climate for change</li>
				<li>Engaging and enabling the organization</li>
				<li>Implementing and sustaining for change</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Steps one through three are the first phase, steps four through six are phase two, and finally, steps seven and eight are the final phase. The steps in the Kotter model are as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create urgency.</li>
				<li>Form a powerful coalition.</li>
				<li>Create a vision for change.</li>
				<li>Communicate the vision.</li>
				<li>Empower action.</li>
				<li>Create quick wins.</li>
				<li>Build on the change.</li>
				<li>Make it stick.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Kotter <a id="_idIndexMarker375"/>introduced this eight-step <a id="_idIndexMarker376"/>model in 1995. Kotter lays out that even if one of the preceding steps were to fail, the whole change initiative will fail. The following diagram is a visual representation of the model:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer035" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_07_01.jpg" alt="Figure 7.1 – Visual representation of the Kotter model&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.1 – Visual representation of the Kotter model</p>
			<p>One of the major benefits of Kotter's model is that the steps are actionable and in the form of a checklist. It's a step-by-step model that is clear to follow, with detailed descriptions of the steps along the way.</p>
			<p>It has a limitation, though, in that it lacks any steps for measurement and is time consuming to implement. Scholars have also pointed out over time that it is a fluid process that does not follow any linear path.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-159"><a id="_idTextAnchor158"/>Rogers' technology adoption curve</h2>
			<p>A slightly <a id="_idIndexMarker377"/>different take on the change management model is the technology adoption curve. The model is used to <a id="_idIndexMarker378"/>define an adoption timeframe and has some uses in popular culture.</p>
			<p>Simon Sinek talks about the technology adoption curve in his now-famous TED talk <em class="italic">Start with Why</em> (<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action">https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action</a>). Sinek refers to this as the <em class="italic">Law of Diffusion of Innovation</em>.</p>
			<p>Developed by George Beal, Everett Rogers, and Joe Bohlen in 1957, the original application was for agriculture, but it was later applied to technology. The technology adoption curve aims to highlight the levels of acceptance of new ideas in society through five distinct stages:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Innovators</li>
				<li>Early adopters</li>
				<li>Early majority</li>
				<li>Late majority</li>
				<li>Laggards</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The curve explains how your idea would be successful regarding adoption. Your idea is not going to be successful if you try to convince the late majority to accept your idea. The <em class="italic">Diffusion of Innovations</em> talks about the gap between early adopters and the early majority; bridging that gap is key to achieving success.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">When adopting DevOps, target the innovators and early adopters in your organization to get support and bring them on the journey. Then, work with the early majority to tip the balance of support.</p>
			<p>Apply this <a id="_idIndexMarker379"/>same principle <a id="_idIndexMarker380"/>of change with DevOps methodologies. When you are trying to drive the adoption of your change strategy for DevOps, make sure you target the innovators and early adopters, then the early majority, within your organization.</p>
			<p>I am a big fan of this model and have used it successfully in several different scenarios. That said, if you are looking for a traditional framework, then this is not the answer for you.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-160"><a id="_idTextAnchor159"/>The ADKAR model</h2>
			<p>The ADKAR model (<a href="https://www.prosci.com/adkar/adkar-model">https://www.prosci.com/adkar/adkar-model</a>) is one that is goal-oriented. The <a id="_idIndexMarker381"/>model was created by Jeff Hiatt, who is the founder of <em class="italic">Prosci</em>. The <a id="_idIndexMarker382"/>company focuses on customer success and is represented around the world.</p>
			<p>ADKAR is <a id="_idIndexMarker383"/>an acronym that represents five tangible outcomes that need to be achieved for lasting change within the organization. Those five outcomes are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Awareness</li>
				<li>Desire</li>
				<li>Knowledge</li>
				<li>Ability</li>
				<li>Reinforcement</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The model <a id="_idIndexMarker384"/>closely follows the steps of Kotter's model as <a id="_idIndexMarker385"/>well in its own way. Similarly, the ADKAR model is <a id="_idIndexMarker386"/>also aligned in three phases as well, which are <strong class="bold">Current</strong>, <strong class="bold">Transition</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Future</strong>.</p>
			<p>The model rewards individual change within the organizational change framework. However, the downside of the model is that in larger organizations, it is cumbersome.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-161"><a id="_idTextAnchor160"/>The EASIER model</h2>
			<p>The EASIER model <a id="_idIndexMarker387"/>follows six broad steps. It was <a id="_idIndexMarker388"/>introduced by David Hussey. You can see similarities in the steps Hussey describes in his model with other frameworks.</p>
			<p>The six steps that make the EASIER model are as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Envision</li>
				<li>Activate</li>
				<li>Support</li>
				<li>Implement</li>
				<li>Ensure</li>
				<li>Recognize</li>
			</ol>
			<p>A limitation of this framework is the heavy reliance on leadership effectiveness and response. A solid benefit though is the checklist-style approach to change management, which makes it popular with many people, much like the Kotter model.</p>
			<p>Now, we have looked at the models for business change and how we can use them for our organizations. Let's now look at the effects of process change.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor161"/>People effects of process change</h1>
			<p>People are the beating heart of your organization. Have people on board. Your organizational <a id="_idIndexMarker389"/>change will likely have a greater chance of success over one where people are disengaged.</p>
			<p>When you go through any organizational change, especially ones that may change the roles and responsibilities of the people involved, it is important to consider the effects of this on the people within your organization, not just those directly affected, but the ones who are indirectly affected as well.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-163"><a id="_idTextAnchor162"/>Direct impact</h2>
			<p>When we talk <a id="_idIndexMarker390"/>about direct impact, we mean employees who are <a id="_idIndexMarker391"/>directly affected by the changes you are proposing. This includes people whose roles and/or responsibilities will change as a result of your proposal.</p>
			<p>Of course, by far the biggest impact you will have comes directly in the form of resistance. We discussed in <a href="B17192_05_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Avoiding Cultural Anti-Patterns in DevOps</em>, that the reasons for resistance are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Fear of losing your job</li>
				<li>Poor communication</li>
				<li>Lack of trust</li>
				<li>Fear of the unknown</li>
				<li>Poor timing</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Those are great reasons, certainly common in my experience, but what about other effects of direct impact? Consider the following effects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Pushing people out of their comfort zone</li>
				<li>Disruption to social arrangements</li>
				<li>Lowering of status</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's now look at these three reasons in more detail.</p>
			<h3>Pushing people out of their comfort zone</h3>
			<p>Throughout your career, you start to get comfortable with what you do. Some people relish the <a id="_idIndexMarker392"/>idea of going out of their comfort zone, but others don't like this at all. Don't assume everyone in your organization cannot wait to get outside of their comfort zone; the reality is that most people don't want that.</p>
			<p>So, one of the consequences of direct impact changes is that people feel as though they are being pushed outside of their comfort zone. For someone who doesn't like this arrangement, this will be unsettling. You need to address this before it results in people leaving the organization.</p>
			<p>We've discussed <a id="_idIndexMarker393"/>quite a bit the importance of communication and transparency. Both are key here – you may not be able to resolve every conflict in this area, but good communication and transparency will make it much easier.</p>
			<h3>Disruption to social arrangements</h3>
			<p>History as well as most management articles tell us that work-life balance is incredibly important <a id="_idIndexMarker394"/>to the mental health of your employees. Part of this balance is the social arrangements employees make with circles inside and outside of the office.</p>
			<p>Anything that appears to disrupt this will also make people nervous and question the validity of the change. Yes, this is a form of resistance, like the other two reasons we are exploring, but you would be shocked to find the number of times this is overlooked.</p>
			<p>If you are working in a large organization over multiple geographies, don't forget the cultural aspect. Your changes may have a negative impact on important dates in one culture's calendar but be harmless for your own.</p>
			<h3>Lowering of status</h3>
			<p>Most people will tell you that job title and status within the business is not important. However, as pointed out in this article on <em class="italic">Glassdoor</em> (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/the-importance-of-title-in-the-job-search-process">https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/the-importance-of-title-in-the-job-search-process</a>), job titles over time help show career progression, reflect salary, and potentially <a id="_idIndexMarker395"/>determine future roles. So, anything that can suppress that progression by reflecting a lowering of status is something potential employers will question.</p>
			<p>For this reason, be careful when you are working with changes that impact roles and responsibilities. You can end up making it seem like someone has got a demotion, judging by a change to their title; hopefully this isn't your intention.</p>
			<p>Now that we understand the direct impact, let's have a look at the indirect impact and effects on people.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-164"><a id="_idTextAnchor163"/>Indirect impact</h2>
			<p>In contrast to direct impact, think of indirect impact as a situation where a team that is directly <a id="_idIndexMarker396"/>impacted by the change does some <a id="_idIndexMarker397"/>critical work for another team; that other team is now indirectly impacted by the changes you are making.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Organizations often consider direct impact and deal with it well, but not indirect impact. This indirect impact can end up making your change fail, so consider the consequences carefully.</p>
			<p>Dealing with indirect impact can be tricky, as you might not even know about it until it's become a problem and you have to fix it. Identifying such impacts early can be crucial to overall success.</p>
			<p>Some examples of indirect impact could be as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Health of employees</li>
				<li>Shadow IT</li>
				<li>Process dependencies</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's look at these three reasons in more detail to understand them better.</p>
			<h3>Health of employees</h3>
			<p>We briefly discussed mental wellbeing in terms of work-life balance, but this goes further <a id="_idIndexMarker398"/>than that. It's about the overall health of your employees. Sudden changes in working conditions, environment, and other factors can have an adverse effect on your health.</p>
			<p>Carefully consider the health impact of the changes you are making. It may be that there are none, but it's still important to consider it. Employees will also appreciate the fact it has been discussed and considered as well.</p>
			<h3>Shadow IT</h3>
			<p>We all know and have experienced <strong class="bold">shadow IT</strong>. This is where separate teams are doing their own <a id="_idIndexMarker399"/>services and running their own tooling outside of the <a id="_idIndexMarker400"/>control of central IT teams. Be incredibly careful with this.</p>
			<p>It's not unusual for shadow IT to be responsible for a business-critical service, and for a change to cause issues with the stability of that service because the team's responsibilities are disrupted.</p>
			<p>Managing shadow IT without causing disruption to innovation in your organization is a tricky balance. For some ideas on how to manage this, look at this article from <em class="italic">TechRepublic</em> (<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-tips-for-managing-shadow-it-without-destroying-innovation">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-tips-for-managing-shadow-it-without-destroying-innovation</a>) on how to manage shadow IT.</p>
			<p>Shadow IT has a huge impact on personnel in your organization. Shadow IT is usually work that is untracked and unaccounted for, so it is often done alongside people's day-to-day roles.</p>
			<h3>Process dependencies</h3>
			<p>Even if you go down the route of creating value stream maps or running through process maps <a id="_idIndexMarker401"/>within your organization, you may miss dependencies between processes. You miss these dependencies if they are manual hand-offs.</p>
			<p>For that reason, it's important to speak to the right people when creating your value stream or process maps. Make multiple passes to ensure you capture all the manual hand-offs so that you reduce the risk of missing process dependencies.</p>
			<p>The risk here is that by missing one of these dependencies, when you change the master process you will break something else downstream. This then has an adverse effect on people downstream: it can increase their workload or it can put undue pressure on them to resolve an issue that may not be fixable now that you have changed something.</p>
			<p>Now let's have a look at some of the common challenges of process change within organizations.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-165"><a id="_idTextAnchor164"/>The common challenges of process change</h1>
			<p>Implementing a change management framework, such as one of the ones we discussed earlier in <em class="italic">Models for business change</em>, comes with its own set of challenges, and sometimes <a id="_idIndexMarker402"/>these challenges can be quite complex.</p>
			<p>Here are several common challenges that are prohibitive to process change:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Organizational resistance</li>
				<li>Lack of established goals</li>
				<li>Poor strategic alignment</li>
				<li>Starting with tools</li>
				<li>Underestimating the need for change frameworks</li>
				<li>The domino effect</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's look at these in more detail to understand their impact. We won't discuss organizational resistance as we've already discussed this previously.</p>
			<h3>Lack of established goals</h3>
			<p>Goals are critical. You must have defined goals, so you know how to measure your success and <a id="_idIndexMarker403"/>know the direction in which you are heading. When you do not establish goals, it is hard to know which direction you are heading in, and you can lose your way quickly.</p>
			<p>When you establish clear and well-defined goals, everyone knows where they need to head; everyone knows what success looks like.</p>
			<h3>Poor strategic alignment</h3>
			<p>Strategic alignment, or lack of it, kills change management. You must gain clear strategic alignment <a id="_idIndexMarker404"/>with all stakeholders. Not having clear strategic alignment results in a failed transformation project.</p>
			<p>One method to achieve strong strategic alignment could be following these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start at the top – goal setting must start with the executive team.</li>
				<li>Create a cascade of goals.</li>
				<li>Drive consistency and accountability.</li>
				<li>Encourage continuous communication.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>What does <a id="_idIndexMarker405"/>this mean? Strategic alignment is making sure that the process changes align with the business goals. When you have a mismatch between the two is where you have issues later down the line. When you are aligned, expect a smoother change process.</p>
			<h3>Starting with tools</h3>
			<p>I'm a passionate believer that when you start with any tool related to DevOps, you are destined for failure. You must consider culture, people, and processes first.</p>
			<p>Implementing <a id="_idIndexMarker406"/>tools before you understand the problem is a disaster waiting to happen. When it comes to tools and processes, and especially automation, you are enabling poor processes to run faster. Work on them first before implementing tools.</p>
			<p>Good alignment and strategy on enterprise architecture is also important. With so many tools available, it's easy to get lost and deploy whichever tools appear to fix the problem. Before long, you have a plethora of tools in your environment. Enterprise architecture looks to implement standards and processes and align standard sets of requirements for new software.</p>
			<p>These requirements are key when it comes to implementing new tools in your organization.</p>
			<h3>Underestimating the need for change frameworks</h3>
			<p>In general, when the impact of change initiatives on people is ignored by organizations, roadblocks <a id="_idIndexMarker407"/>arise, and the desired results are not achieved. For process management, many organizations have limited staff involvement. Employees who don't understand, care for, or even agree with the process are limited in commitment. Employee engagement builds employee support and overcomes corporate resistance.</p>
			<h3>The domino effect</h3>
			<p>Organizations that report that their process management efforts do not have pre-established <a id="_idIndexMarker408"/>goals will likely face further challenges, such as the lack of strategic alignment, insufficient communication, and the lack of IT tools. This second set of challenges leads to several challenges in managing change, including resistance to the organization and the need for change management.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-166"><a id="_idTextAnchor165"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we looked at how to effectively implement change within your organization. As part of this, we looked at eight simple steps to help achieve this and four change models used in organizations to help change be effective. We also looked at the direct and indirect effects that process change has on people within an organization. Finally, we looked at the common challenges you may face when implementing change within organizations.</p>
			<p>Next, we will look at the continuous improvement of processes – how do you improve your processes when you have gone through the improvement process already? We will look at some techniques for continuous improvement, how to iterate changes to processes, and how to keep pace with change.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-167"><a id="_idTextAnchor166"/>Questions</h1>
