    change effectively are ones that come out on top in the long run and beat their

    your next task to undertake is to look at how to effectively deliver that change

    entire practice of change management. It is that important.

    fear of the unknown. More generically, there is a level of risk associated with
    every change you make. Maybe it won't have the desired effects.

- en: Goals are critical. You must have defined goals, so you know how to measure
    your success and know the direction in which you are heading. When you do not
    establish goals, it is hard to know which direction you are heading in, and you
    can lose your way quickly.

    to head; everyone knows what success looks like.

- en: Strategic alignment, or lack of it, kills change management. You must gain clear
    strategic alignment with all stakeholders. Not having clear strategic alignment
    results in a failed transformation project.

    align with the business goals. When you have a mismatch between the two is where
    you have issues later down the line. When you are aligned, expect a smoother change
    process.

    happen. When it comes to tools and processes, and especially automation, you are
    enabling poor processes to run faster. Work on them first before implementing
    tools.

    so many tools available, it's easy to get lost and deploy whichever tools appear
    to fix the problem. Before long, you have a plethora of tools in your environment.
    Enterprise architecture looks to implement standards and processes and align standard
    sets of requirements for new software.

- en: In general, when the impact of change initiatives on people is ignored by organizations,
    roadblocks arise, and the desired results are not achieved. For process management,
    many organizations have limited staff involvement. Employees who don't understand,
    care for, or even agree with the process are limited in commitment. Employee engagement
    builds employee support and overcomes corporate resistance.

    pre-established goals will likely face further challenges, such as the lack of
    strategic alignment, insufficient communication, and the lack of IT tools. This
    second set of challenges leads to several challenges in managing change, including
    resistance to the organization and the need for change management.

    organization. As part of this, we looked at eight simple steps to help achieve
    this and four change models used in organizations to help change be effective.
    We also looked at the direct and indirect effects that process change has on people
    within an organization. Finally, we looked at the common challenges you may face
    when implementing change within organizations.

    your processes when you have gone through the improvement process already? We
    will look at some techniques for continuous improvement, how to iterate changes
    to processes, and how to keep pace with change.
