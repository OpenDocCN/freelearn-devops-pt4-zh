			<h1 id="_idParaDest-168"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor167"/>Chapter 8</em>: Continuous Improvement of Processes</h1>
			<p>Continuous feedback and improvement is a key element of DevOps. The ability to keep learning and providing feedback on all aspects of DevOps to further improve what you are doing and provide more value to the business is a fundamental pillar of DevOps. This chapter looks at the techniques for continuous feedback, how to iterate process changes, and ensuring everyone stays up to date with changes.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What is continuous improvement and feedback?</li>
				<li>Techniques for continuous improvement and feedback</li>
				<li>Iterating changes to processes</li>
				<li>Keeping pace with change</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-169"><a id="_idTextAnchor168"/>What is continuous improvement and feedback?</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Continuous improvement</strong> is the process <a id="_idIndexMarker409"/>of ongoing effort required to improve services, products, or processes. This process can be done in an iterative manner over a period or all at once. How this is done is dependent on the degree of change we are looking to make.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Continuous feedback</strong> has <a id="_idIndexMarker410"/>many different uses, including the ability to provide feedback to employees on their performance. You can also use continuous feedback in product development to gain valuable insights into the performance of your product. The systematic way that strengths and weaknesses of employee performance are discussed translates well to the product world and DevOps as well.</p>
			<p>Let's now look at continuous improvement in more detail.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-170"><a id="_idTextAnchor169"/>Building a continuous improvement culture</h2>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker411"/> concept of DevOps is primarily built around continuous everything. Lots of terminology in DevOps also includes it in the name, such as continuous integration, and continuous deployment to name a couple. Continuous everything is a great level to achieve, and things like continuous integration, testing, and deployment work towards removing bottlenecks in software delivery processes and tools.</p>
			<p>Continuous improvement, however, looks at the removal of bottlenecks in DevOps systems and processes. Creating a culture of continuous improvement is not specific to technology or DevOps though.</p>
			<p>Building a successful continuous improvement culture is all about making sure you instill the principles at each level of leadership. As time progresses, you should make noise about your successes; you have to fight the inertia and reluctance to change processes and routines, even the bad ones.</p>
			<p>Let's now look at continuous feedback in more detail. Many industries already have well-developed practices and methodologies around continuous improvement. We can take a lot of learnings from the manufacturing industry, where lean was born. In lean, continuous improvement is called <strong class="bold">Kaizen</strong>. Let's discuss this in more detail.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-171"><a id="_idTextAnchor170"/>Understanding and implementing Kaizen principles</h2>
			<p>Kaizen was born over 30 years ago thanks to Masaaki Imai, the founder of the <em class="italic">Kaizen Institute</em> (https://www.kaizen.com). Today, Kaizen is<a id="_idIndexMarker412"/> recognized as a key pillar <a id="_idIndexMarker413"/>when it comes to competitive advantage. </p>
			<p>Kaizen is built on five<a id="_idIndexMarker414"/> principles:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Know your customer</strong> – Determine their interests so that you can improve their experience. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Let it flow</strong> – Everyone in your organization should strive to add value while reducing waste.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Go to gemba</strong> – Value is created where things happen.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Empower people</strong> – Performance and improvements should be tangible and visible.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Be transparent</strong> – Set the same goals for your teams and provide a system and tools to reach them.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>One of the most famous<a id="_idIndexMarker415"/> implementations of Kaizen is the <strong class="bold">Toyota Production System</strong> or <strong class="bold">TPS</strong> for short (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System). The expectation is that when an anomaly is detected, all<a id="_idIndexMarker416"/> production personnel stop what they are doing and suggest an improvement to resolve the issue. This may then initiate Kaizen.</p>
			<p>The cycle of Kaizen, known <a id="_idIndexMarker417"/>as a blitz, burst, or event is based on <strong class="bold">PDCA</strong>, or the Deming cycle, and defines four steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Plan</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Do</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Check</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Act</strong></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The fundamental concept of this is to identify any waste in the system and quickly remove it. In <a href="B17192_07_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor146"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Delivering Process Change in Your Organization</em>, on driving process change with value stream maps, one of the symbols we discussed was the initiation of a Kaizen burst. If you think back to that chapter, then think about what we have discussed here, this is where you can see the link between the two activities.</p>
			<p>The value stream map is used to map out and identify the activities and the waste, then the Kaizen burst is used to eliminate that waste. It is the burst that is the activity performed to resolve the waste and implement a new process.</p>
			<p>Another common continuous<a id="_idIndexMarker418"/> improvement model is <em class="italic">Six Sigma</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma</a>). Kaizen and Six Sigma are the two models you will often find in DevOps, used to continuously improve processes.</p>
			<p>The main difference is that Kaizen seeks to improve the business as a whole by establishing a standard way of working, increasing efficiency, and eliminating business waste.</p>
			<p>Six Sigma is more concerned with output quality (the final product). This is made possible by identifying and eliminating the sources of defects.</p>
			<p>Lean is all about<a id="_idIndexMarker419"/> eliminating waste in order to increase process speed and quality by reducing process waste.</p>
			<p>Let's now look at how to build a culture of continuous feedback at your organization.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-172"><a id="_idTextAnchor171"/>Building a continuous feedback culture</h2>
			<p>Carrying on from <a id="_idIndexMarker420"/>our theme of continuous everything when it comes to DevOps, if continuous improvement is the methodology used to improve your processes and systems, then continuous feedback is the mechanism that highlights that opportunity for change.</p>
			<p>Like continuous improvement, continuous feedback is not a DevOps exclusive idea or model but also takes inspiration from the employee management world. Continuous feedback can be considered informal, however, tools and processes do exist to define how the feedback is collected, processed, and even acted upon:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Clear communication of vision and goals</li>
				<li>Understanding the purpose of continuous feedback</li>
				<li>Providing channels and tools to share feedback</li>
				<li>Ensuring accountability for the feedback given and received</li>
				<li>Educating teams about the importance of continuous feedback</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's now look at these five key elements of continuous feedback culture in more detail.</p>
			<h3>Clear communication of vision and goals</h3>
			<p>Without clear<a id="_idIndexMarker421"/> communication of your organization's vision and goals, it's hard for your teams to contribute feedback on how to improve. When your teams clearly understand vision and goals, it makes it easy for them to provide quality feedback on the things that need to change.</p>
			<p>Feedback, when you understand the context of both the vision and goals, allows your teams to directly think about what parts of processes, systems, and tools need to change to enable your <a id="_idIndexMarker422"/>organization to have a greater chance of achieving its goals.</p>
			<h3>Understanding the purpose of continuous feedback</h3>
			<p>Providing good feedback is not <a id="_idIndexMarker423"/>simply about just saying "good job" or "you didn't execute well enough." Good feedback provides tangible examples with a detailed explanation. It should be as descriptive as possible and as real-time as possible.</p>
			<p>Feedback allows for the management of performance. This is irrespective of either individuals or assets such as products or services. Feedback helps identify areas of both improvement and strength, which with feedback can be respectively made better or even stronger.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">Continuous feedback should not just come from leaders. It should come from everyone and be treated the same no matter where it comes from.</p>
			<p>From your team's perspective, this also provides the ability for them to voice their opinions and concerns in a constructive manner, especially when you are starting out on your DevOps transformation. This is a useful way to engage everyone.</p>
			<h3>Providing channels and tools to share feedback</h3>
			<p>Providing several ways, known <a id="_idIndexMarker424"/>as channels, to share feedback is crucial. Everyone likes to engage in a different way. You will find some people use one channel and others use another.</p>
			<p>Individual feedback sessions, as well as group feedback sessions, give a great balance and you will find that you will get great feedback from both sessions. One of the benefits of group feedback sessions is that you will find that feedback from one person may spur on similar feedback or validation of that feedback. This can be a powerful exercise.</p>
			<p>Don't discount the power of anonymous feedback. While it would be great to attribute every piece of great feedback to an individual, even in culturally mature environments, the truth is that <a id="_idIndexMarker425"/>people sometimes want to provide feedback anonymously. There is nothing wrong with this approach and anonymous feedback should be welcomed and actioned the same way.</p>
			<h3>Ensuring accountability for the feedback given and received</h3>
			<p>Regardless of <a id="_idIndexMarker426"/>whether your feedback is anonymous or not, it's key that someone is accountable for that feedback, both if you are providing feedback and if you are receiving feedback. You need to own that feedback. Everyone needs to be committed to the culture of continuous feedback.</p>
			<p>Consistency is required for feedback to change a culture. It helps drive accountability and transparency horizontally and vertically. Make sure the feedback is public. The actions you take and, if possible, the decisions you made to decide on the appropriate action to take, should be public.</p>
			<h3>Educating teams about the importance of continuous feedback</h3>
			<p>One thing you cannot <a id="_idIndexMarker427"/>do or expect is to implement a system of continuous feedback and have teams and employees get it overnight. Training and communication are important here as both in tandem allow you to highlight the reasons why you are doing the scheme, what the benefits will be, and how it will work.</p>
			<p>Highlight to employees that both positive and negative feedback is equal. Both positive and negative feedback helps you improve, regardless of whether that is employee performance, product performance, or service performance.</p>
			<p>Now we understand what continuous feedback and improvement are. Let's now look at the techniques we can use to implement them within our organization.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-173"><a id="_idTextAnchor172"/>Techniques for continuous improvement and feedback</h1>
			<p>When we looked at <em class="italic">What is continuous improvement and feedback?</em> at the start of the chapter, we briefly discussed the use of Kaizen and there was a quick mention of Six Sigma, which are both <a id="_idIndexMarker428"/>methodologies you can use to take steps towards <a id="_idIndexMarker429"/>continuous improvement. What about before you get to that stage though?</p>
			<p>Let's now look at techniques you can use for continuous improvement.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-174"><a id="_idTextAnchor173"/>Continuous improvement processes</h2>
			<p>As we discussed in <a id="_idIndexMarker430"/>the previous section, the PDSA cycle stands for Plan, Do, Study, and Act. Behind this is a six-step model that is a systematic <a id="_idIndexMarker431"/>approach to planning, sequencing, and improving efforts using data and is an elaboration of the PDSA model.</p>
			<p>The six steps used are as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Identify opportunities</li>
				<li>Analyze the root cause</li>
				<li>Take action</li>
				<li>Study the results</li>
				<li>Standardize the solution</li>
				<li>Plan for the future</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These distinct steps are sequential and an essential part of a continuous improvement process. Your continuous improvement plans should always link back to your organization's vision, goals, and priorities.</p>
			<p>Let's have a look at these six steps in more detail.</p>
			<h3>Identify opportunities</h3>
			<p>You can identify opportunities for process improvement in a few different ways. An opportunity is likely to come from continuous feedback where a problem is highlighted and the result of that is the opportunity to improve.</p>
			<p>It could also <a id="_idIndexMarker432"/>come from personal feedback from the team working with the process, or in less mature environments, where the continuous feedback loop is not yet fully established but an operational issue or complaint has triggered that review.</p>
			<h3>Analyze the root cause</h3>
			<p>Before you can start to remediate<a id="_idIndexMarker433"/> the problem, you need to understand what the problem is. Make sure you identify the root cause of the problem. Remember, in some cases, issues occur because of a chain of events, so don't stop at the first problem you find. Keep looking backward to find the earliest issue that could have set off a chain reaction of events.</p>
			<p>The analysis does not stop there though. When you know what the root cause is, validate those findings and see what you can do to prove that is indeed the root cause. Depending on the process, and of course the inputs, you may even be able to reproduce the results.</p>
			<h3>Take action</h3>
			<p>When you are ready to act, this is a<a id="_idIndexMarker434"/> two-step process. First, you need to be able to plan the actions that correct the root cause. Bear in mind, there could be numerous actions needed to resolve the problem.</p>
			<p>The second step is implementing those planned actions. Implementing that plan comes with several actions. Communicating your plan is crucial here. Having the right people in place is also important to help make the changes successful.</p>
			<h3>Study the results</h3>
			<p>Confirming the actions you have <a id="_idIndexMarker435"/>taken and implemented is also important. You need to monitor associated metrics with the process you have changed and any associated outputs and tooling to make sure that your changes have worked and have not had an adverse effect.</p>
			<p>Be prepared through your planning to have a route to back out of the changes should they be unsuccessful and to make small incremental changes if needed to make your changes successful.</p>
			<h3>Standardize the solution</h3>
			<p>Through regular<a id="_idIndexMarker436"/> monitoring, you can see whether the results you are seeing are consistent and established. At this point, you must ensure that the improved level of performance is consistently maintained.</p>
			<p>Sometimes you will need to make further changes to make this standardized approach stick across the whole organization. You should make sure you plan for those things as well.</p>
			<h3>Plan for the future</h3>
			<p>When you have completed<a id="_idIndexMarker437"/> your implementation, take a step back. A simple retrospective will help here. Work with the team to identify what went well. This is a form of continuous feedback and what you learn here can be applied next time you make a process change.</p>
			<p>Any residual problems that come out of the change need to be accounted and planned for here as well.</p>
			<p>Now we have looked at the six steps involved in continuous improvement, let's have a look at other continuous improvement techniques you can use in your organization.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-175"><a id="_idTextAnchor174"/>Additional continuous improvement techniques</h2>
			<p>We have just walked through<a id="_idIndexMarker438"/> one example of a continuous improvement process that you can use in your organization to help get started. Of<a id="_idIndexMarker439"/> course, plenty of other frameworks and techniques exist though. Let's have a look at some of them.</p>
			<h3>Daily huddles</h3>
			<p>One of the most <a id="_idIndexMarker440"/>common agile practices that almost all organizations will practice is the daily huddle, sometimes known as the daily standup. Your daily <a id="_idIndexMarker441"/>huddle can be a source of inspiration for identifying opportunities to improve.</p>
			<p>Having the whole<a id="_idIndexMarker442"/> team on that short call to discuss impediments will give people the opportunity to have their say about things that can be done to remove that impediment, which might even be a Kaizen burst to resolve a bottleneck.</p>
			<h3>Catchball</h3>
			<p>This is a lean<a id="_idIndexMarker443"/> technique that involves the movement of ideas from one person or a team to another one for feedback. Strictly speaking, this could also be a continuous feedback technique.</p>
			<p>This method means people at different levels of the organization get to provide feedback and contribute to the development of that idea. It could be anything as well – in DevOps, this is commonly a product or service.</p>
			<h3>Gemba walks</h3>
			<p>You may not have heard of gemba<a id="_idIndexMarker444"/> walks, but you'll most likely have seen them done before. The practice involves leaders walking around, asking questions, and identifying opportunities for improvement with the people on the ground executing the work.</p>
			<p>Improvements that are found are not implemented at this stage. This is done after analysis is done.</p>
			<p>Now we have looked at some other continuous improvement techniques you can use in your organization, let's move on to looking at the continuous feedback process in more detail.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-176"><a id="_idTextAnchor175"/>The continuous feedback process</h2>
			<p>In very simple terms, continuous<a id="_idIndexMarker445"/> feedback or a continuous feedback loop can be simplified as four simple steps. These four steps are as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Assess</li>
				<li>Modify</li>
				<li>Plan</li>
				<li>Implement</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It won't come as a <a id="_idIndexMarker446"/>shock to you that the four steps outlined above have very close relationships with the continuous improvement process we discussed earlier. You can connect both processes together though.</p>
			<p>The process outlined above for continuous feedback ensures you have the appropriate process in place to capture feedback, assess what that feedback means, plan how it is going to be actioned, and then implement that plan. This is where continuous improvement comes in.</p>
			<p>Let's now look at other continuous feedback techniques you can use within your organization.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-177"><a id="_idTextAnchor176"/>Additional continuous feedback techniques</h2>
			<p>Most continuous <a id="_idIndexMarker447"/>feedback techniques come from the<a id="_idIndexMarker448"/> employee performance management world and human resources. You can use a number of those techniques for product and service feedback though.</p>
			<p>Let's look at some of them.</p>
			<h3>The EDGE framework</h3>
			<p>The founder of Zoomly <em class="italic">Dawn Sillett</em> (https://www.zoomly.co.uk/people) outlines the <strong class="bold">EDGE</strong> feedback framework. It is an acronym for <strong class="bold">Explain, Describe, Give</strong>, and <strong class="bold">End Positively</strong>, this provides a clear <a id="_idIndexMarker449"/>structure that <a id="_idIndexMarker450"/>aims to improve clarity and provides actionable results from that feedback.</p>
			<p>Each component of the framework is aimed at improving performance in a sustained manner.</p>
			<h3>360-degree feedback</h3>
			<p>You will have come across 360-degree feedback in <a id="_idIndexMarker451"/>your time. This is the task of collecting feedback from multiple sources to build up a bigger picture of performance. In human terms, this is from leaders, managers, colleagues, and peers.</p>
			<p>In the DevOps world, this <a id="_idIndexMarker452"/>can be from different product managers, engineers, security teams, customers, and other sources. Think about whether you want your 360-degree feedback to be anonymous or not. This is an important factor when it comes to quality.</p>
			<p>Cross-team feedback is great, but remember, not all teams have the same culture. Without a mechanism to provide anonymous feedback, some people may not be as honest as they could be.</p>
			<h3>Feedback ratios</h3>
			<p>Different research <a id="_idIndexMarker453"/>suggests that the ratio of positive to negative feedback should be between 3:1 and 5:1. This is of course when working with humans, but feedback on processes, products, or services is similar.</p>
			<p>Regardless of which ratio you work with, ensure that you heavily load feedback with positives over negatives. Emphasis on positive feedback helps create a culture of improvement and performance.</p>
			<p>Now we have looked at the continuous feedback techniques available to us in our business, let's now look at how to iterate changes to your processes.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-178"><a id="_idTextAnchor177"/>Iterating changes to processes</h1>
			<p>Just like with <a id="_idIndexMarker454"/>application code, it is important to take an iterative approach to changing processes. When it comes to application code, we take this approach so that if something does go wrong, we can easily know what changes were made, who made them, and why. It provides full traceability of what is happening.</p>
			<p>We need that same level of traceability and transparency when it comes to iterating changes to processes. That way, if at any point we need to see what happened and why, it's easy to identify that information. Secondly, we can see the impact of a change before moving onto the next one.</p>
			<p>This really applies to all types of changes, from technology processes to business processes. The biggest impact does not come with individual changes to those processes, but large programs of change that involve numerous changes to the same set of processes or the same process.</p>
			<p>When we work<a id="_idIndexMarker455"/> in iterations, or in sprints as we commonly call them in agile methodologies, the results are clear, impactful, and wide-ranging across several disciplines. In fact, iterative design is commonly adopted as a design methodology in the prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refinement of a product. Why not apply this in process design as well?</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-179"><a id="_idTextAnchor178"/>Iterative design processes</h2>
			<p>When<a id="_idIndexMarker456"/> designing new processes, just like in product design, remember that changes are easier to make and less expensive to implement in the earliest stages of the development cycle.</p>
			<p>In iterative design, the first step is to create a prototype. You can do the same with a process as well. Using all the requirements you have and the tools at your disposal, work on a prototype process and work through scenarios, documenting the outcomes, which is valuable feedback on how your process works.</p>
			<p>Focus groups are used in iterative design processes as well. Just like gaining 360-degree feedback, or some of the elements of Kaizen, they work to gain feedback from specific groups of people on specific problems.</p>
			<p>Iterative design is usually a continual process. The techniques we have discussed so far in this chapter have taught us the elements of this continual process.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-180"><a id="_idTextAnchor179"/>Using iterative design</h2>
			<p>Iterative design is a <a id="_idIndexMarker457"/>way to face the realities of unpredictable user needs and behaviors, which can lead to major changes in the design. User testing often shows, when confronted with a user test, that even carefully assessed ideas are insufficient. It is therefore important that the flexibility of the iterative design approach is, as far as possible, extended to the system. Designers must also recognize that user testing results can lead to fundamental changes that require designers to be prepared to give up their old ideas in favor of more user-friendly new ideas.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-181"><a id="_idTextAnchor180"/>Benefits of iterative design</h2>
			<p>When correctly applied, iterative<a id="_idIndexMarker458"/> design is a way of making sure that the best possible solution is in place. Significant cost savings are also possible when the iterative design approach is applied early in the development cycle.</p>
			<p>Some other key benefits include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Misinterpretations become evident earlier in the process</li>
				<li>It encourages user feedback</li>
				<li>The development focuses on issues most critical to the project</li>
				<li>Inconsistencies between the design and requirements are detected early</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We have looked at some techniques for continuous improvement and feedback in this section. Next, we will look at how to keep pace with change in your organization.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-182"><a id="_idTextAnchor181"/>Keeping pace with change</h1>
			<p>On top of an<a id="_idIndexMarker459"/> individual's day-to-day role, it can be difficult keeping up with the technology changes in their field, as well as all the work they are doing in the current sprint, thinking about future work coming up as well. It's hard, so adding on top of that the process changes you are making makes it very difficult.</p>
			<p>You need to be able to manage the pace of change within your organization when it comes to process changes. Of course, process changes are very important – they are how you improve as an organization, but they can be the thing people forget the quickest.</p>
			<p>Process changes usually fail because the change fails to stick in the organization. With lots of competing priorities in most organizations and lots of information to keep on top of, many people sadly forget process information first.</p>
			<p>The following things can be used to try and make this easier for your employees and make your process changes stick:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Effective communication</li>
				<li>Knowledge transfer</li>
				<li>Access to subject matter experts</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's now have a look at these three areas in more detail.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-183"><a id="_idTextAnchor182"/>Effective communication</h2>
			<p>Having an effective<a id="_idIndexMarker460"/> method of communication is part of making your process changes stick in your organization.</p>
			<h3>Working groups</h3>
			<p>As a working group<a id="_idIndexMarker461"/> that is implementing a change to a process, you can set up sessions throughout the process to ensure that the changes you are making are bite-sized and that you communicate them frequently.</p>
			<p>People are more likely to consume smaller chunks of information, especially when they have a high workload. Consider setting up working groups in person and virtually to maximize attendance.</p>
			<h3>Collaboration tools</h3>
			<p>Collaboration tools such as<a id="_idIndexMarker462"/> Microsoft Teams or Slack are effective at grouping together communication on such important topics. You can use the channels or groups concept to create a process group. Have everyone check this periodically and make wider announcements.</p>
			<p>One of the benefits of this method is the communications and information you share are available for people to look back on. The drawback to attending meetings is people don't always make notes. Collaboration tools can fix this by making sure you have historical information available to view.</p>
			<h3>Group-wide emails</h3>
			<p>From experience, group-wide, generic emails<a id="_idIndexMarker463"/> to many people don't work. The communication isn't personal enough to engage people and have them look at the content properly.</p>
			<p>If you do take this approach, consider something to make it more targeted rather than a blanket communication, to keep people engaged.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-184"><a id="_idTextAnchor183"/>Knowledge transfer</h2>
			<p>The transfer<a id="_idIndexMarker464"/> of knowledge is important. We just discussed the use of collaboration tools. Use them to help transfer knowledge and keep documentation stored centrally so that there is one master version of truth for all process documents and flowcharts.</p>
			<p>Everyone takes in information differently and it's important that you cater for these scenarios, but try to make sure that above all, this knowledge is stored centrally. Wikis are great tools to help with this and they're open to everyone to edit where applicable.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-185"><a id="_idTextAnchor184"/>Access to subject matter experts</h2>
			<p>Having appropriate<a id="_idIndexMarker465"/> documentation and methods of communication and knowledge transfer is of course important, as we have just discussed. One of the simplest things you can do though is to make sure your subject matter experts have time to work with people who need help.</p>
			<p>A common way of doing this I have implemented before that works well is to have your subject matter experts sit with the teams affected, so if they have a question, they can just ask – no need to raise a formal ticket and wait for a response over email.</p>
			<p>Added benefits to this are that you increase the collaboration between people within your organization and this has longer-term benefits the more people work together. It helps establish an open culture and creates trust in turn.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-186"><a id="_idTextAnchor185"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we looked at the topics of continuous improvement and continuous feedback. We looked at Kaizen principles and how to build an effective continuous improvement and feedback culture in your organization. We also discussed how to iterate changes to your processes with iterative design processes, as well as how to keep pace with the rate of change in your organization.</p>
			<p>The skills learned in this chapter will help you and your team continuously improve along your DevOps journey, not just during the initial transformation but, as we discussed, during the ongoing evolution of DevOps within your organization.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we'll look at the technical stack for DevOps. We'll look at the groups of DevOps tools available, understand how tooling helps in DevOps, and the pros and cons of DevOps tools.</p>
