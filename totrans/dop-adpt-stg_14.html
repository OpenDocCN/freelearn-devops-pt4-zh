			<p>Simply picking tooling and implementing it in your environment is not going to make you successful and will set your DevOps transformation back. You should engage others, listen to concerns, and develop a strategy for implementing your tooling. In this chapter, we will look at the considerations for creating a strategy for tooling.</p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will understand the importance of following architectural best practices as well as security requirements at all times, learn how to develop training plans to help your team use the new tooling, and learn about the importance of having owners and processes associated with tooling.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding architectural and security requirements</li>
				<li>Developing training plans to help your team</li>
				<li>Defining owners and processes for tooling</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-218"><a id="_idTextAnchor217"/>Understanding architectural and security requirements</h1>
			<p>When you're <a id="_idIndexMarker499"/>implementing anything in your organization, be that new tools <a id="_idIndexMarker500"/>or even technical processes or updates to existing tools, it is important to consider the impact this will have on the enterprise architecture and information security. These two groups are the cornerstone of IT organizations and working toward their defined goals, which will closely align with the business goals, will help you in your search for appropriate tooling.</p>
			<p>To explore this further, it's important to understand the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Why is enterprise architecture important?</li>
				<li>Why is information security important?</li>
				<li>Understanding architectural requirements</li>
				<li>Understanding security requirements</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's look at these four points in more detail to get a better understanding.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-219"><a id="_idTextAnchor218"/>Why is enterprise architecture important?</h2>
			<p>There<a id="_idIndexMarker501"/> are many benefits to <strong class="bold">enterprise architecture</strong> within an organization. The most obvious is the top-down view of systems within the enterprise. This alone makes enterprise architecture invaluable when it comes to managing the complexities involved with many businesses.</p>
			<p>In years gone by, many people saw enterprise architecture as a sole function of IT and operating from the ivory tower. In recent years, this view has changed dramatically. Instead of enterprise architecture just being thought of as a function of IT, it now plays a pivotal role in bridging the gap that exists between the business and IT.</p>
			<p>The practice of enterprise architecture has evolved over the years. From being a foundational and supporting role, it is now more progressive and outcome-focused and identifies opportunities for change and growth.</p>
			<p>Enterprise architecture is important because it determines the overall strategy for services and applications. A strategy and roadmap for enterprise architecture will define blueprints for deploying services, a list of things services must have before they will be considered for service. It also defines the platforms that the organization will use in the short, mid, and long term.</p>
			<p>Therefore, taking all this information into account when you are looking at tooling around DevOps means that you have a lot to consider. Does your tooling meet the requirements that have been set out for applications that your organization will use?</p>
			<p>When I think about enterprise architecture, I think of three main benefits that it provides to an organization:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Management of complexity</li>
				<li>Creating actionable deliverables</li>
				<li>Increasing agility and reducing time to value</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's look at these three areas in more detail.</p>
			<h3>Management of complexity</h3>
			<p>Most<a id="_idIndexMarker502"/> organizations, especially enterprises, are a mesh of systems and applications. That mesh has a variety of degrees of importance and prominence within the <a id="_idIndexMarker503"/>organization. There are no real rules to defining these degrees of importance or prominence either. That is part of what makes it complex.</p>
			<p>Some applications are incredibly important to the success of the business, but outside of IT, people may not know what the application is called.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The top-down view that enterprise architectures use means that organizations are more efficient and confident at assessing assets such as applications.</p>
			<p>The holistic view that enterprise architecture brings is there to build up not just one area, but areas across the whole organization. This provides views that, for example, might identify areas where multiple applications are addressing the same process.</p>
			<p>Another view may conclude that an application that is seemingly less prominent is actually integral. That view helps us avoid scenarios where leadership might be thinking about phasing the application out from the landscape.</p>
			<h3>Creating actionable deliverables</h3>
			<p>Previously, we talked about <a id="_idIndexMarker504"/>assessing our current capabilities and managing the complex landscape that is in many organizations. With the holistic view we discussed, this also helps enterprise architecture teams identify any gaps.</p>
			<p>This all-round better understanding of the architecture within an organization means that organizations can make more informed decisions, including <em class="italic">what</em> they should invest in going forward.</p>
			<p>Importantly, it also helps the organization understand <em class="italic">when</em> roadmaps can be created so that they can reflect on an organization's key priorities, and pressing concerns throughout the organization can impact this.</p>
			<p>Overall, this approach<a id="_idIndexMarker505"/> will help the organization meet the current demands that have been placed on it, as well as current opportunities. All of this happens while mitigating any disruption to service. It ensures this can be done with the long-term vision of the organization.</p>
			<h3>Increasing agility and reducing time to value</h3>
			<p>Today, in<a id="_idIndexMarker506"/> the era of rapidly evolving technology, as well as often highly disruptive digital transformation, the need for tools to help with enterprise architecture is clear.</p>
			<p>Tools will help speed <a id="_idIndexMarker507"/>up the decision support for optimization, alternative investment, rationalization, and planning for risks, change, and the overall <a id="_idIndexMarker508"/>impact to the organization. Organizations that translate all of this into tangible outputs are better equipped to evaluate as well as implement new technology in an efficient manner.</p>
			<p>In short, a well-functioning enterprise architecture will help the business capture and understand, as well as articulate, the opportunities, risks, and challenges that exist. This includes security. Let's look at the importance of information security.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor219"/>Why is information security important?</h2>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker509"/>modern world, where data is king and most of our data is stored in systems, information security is incredibly important. Mishaps in data handling and security incidents can sink companies and cause irreparable damage to an organization's reputation.</p>
			<p>Sadly, many people still have no idea about how important information security is to a business and, of course, the success of that business. Many managers also still hold the frightening misconception that information being controlled by them is secure and free from threat. This misconception is, of course, a big mistake.</p>
			<p>In our roles as technologists today, we enjoy the benefits of years of advancement in the technology we use. Because of this, cyber-attacks are on the rise and increasingly more damaging. Repeat attacks are on the rise and before you realize it, your organization could be the target of another cyber-attack and already at risk.</p>
			<p>This is why <a id="_idIndexMarker510"/>you have to be very careful when it comes to handling and processing confidential pieces of information.</p>
			<h3>Why should my organization worry about security?</h3>
			<p>Consider the importance of internal information about your organization. Strategy plans, financial information, employee records, merger and acquisition information â€“ the list is endless.</p>
			<p>If leaked, this has a serious domino effect, which quickly triggers several other consequences, such as damaging your reputation, exposing your strategy, and exposing any company secrets or intellectual property.</p>
			<p>Not only can this information be damaging to your company, but what about your customers? You likely hold information about your customers, such as who they are, what they use, how much they spend, what they spend it on, and maybe even their plans for the future, which is now freely available on the internet.</p>
			<p>Outside of the enterprise, many smaller organizations think they are not targets for cyber criminals and do not need to invest in data security and cyber defenses.</p>
			<p>In fact, due to this lack of protection, many successful attacks target companies of this size; many don't know that their systems have even been compromised until well after the event, when it's too late.</p>
			<p>I recommend watching this video on <em class="italic">YouTube</em> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L9JerWIT3Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L9JerWIT3Y</a>) about the importance of information security. The video looks at where sensitive information is stored and the various types of information we handle to explain the importance of information security.</p>
			<h3>Which common threats should I be aware of?</h3>
			<p>Tools exist to deal with common threats. Code scanning tools in<a id="_idIndexMarker511"/> particular will look for vulnerability exploits within the source code of an application. Threats are dealt with by information security professionals on a daily basis. From my experience, I would say that the following five threats are the most common ones that professionals have to deal with:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Exploiting vulnerabilities</li>
				<li>Malware</li>
				<li>Phishing</li>
				<li>Systems offline</li>
				<li>Lack of confidentiality</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's have a look at these five threats in more detail.</p>
			<h4>Exploiting vulnerabilities</h4>
			<p>Hackers and cyber <a id="_idIndexMarker512"/>criminals look for vulnerabilities within systems that can <a id="_idIndexMarker513"/>help facilitate their attacks. Typically, vulnerabilities exist because of negligence in the management of those systems, such as not changing passwords and not updating those systems to include the latest vendor updates.</p>
			<p>Sometimes though, hackers take advantage of what are called zero-day vulnerabilities, which have not yet had a patch released by the vendor.</p>
			<h4>Malware</h4>
			<p>One of the most common <a id="_idIndexMarker514"/>vectors of attack that goes back to the beginning of cyber-attacks is malware. Simply put, malware<a id="_idIndexMarker515"/> is an infectious agent that attacks software of part of an application with malicious code. The purpose of this is to damage data or even devices within the organization.</p>
			<p>A more extreme example of this is the SolarWinds Orion attack in 2020. This was an attack fundamentally on the supply chain, where malicious code was inserted during the build and release process. This method ensures that, if undetected, your malware is in the final product and the binaries of the software are signed, making them look like genuine releases.</p>
			<p>Updates were then applied to the product as part of regular maintenance and organizations around the world unknowingly installed software with a backdoor onto their networks.</p>
			<p>Other examples of malware in the form of a supply chain attack include the Target security breach, as well as the Stuxnet virus, which targeted control and data acquisition systems, according to <em class="italic">Business Insider</em> (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stuxnet-was-far-more-dangerous-than-previous-thought-2013-11">https://www.businessinsider.com/stuxnet-was-far-more-dangerous-than-previous-thought-2013-11</a>), rendering 1/5th of Iran's nuclear centrifuges damaged.</p>
			<h4>Phishing</h4>
			<p>The rise of phishing<a id="_idIndexMarker516"/> is huge. The root of phishing<a id="_idIndexMarker517"/> attacks is electronic fraud. One of the ways criminals act is via impersonation. This could be by faking emails from someone trusted within your organization, enticing you to click links in emails that are actually infected.</p>
			<p>In the outside world, the biggest goals of phishing are to steal banking information, as well as identities. In the corporate world, though, this includes information about your business and what you plan to do with it.</p>
			<h4>Systems offline</h4>
			<p>One of the most common<a id="_idIndexMarker518"/> attacks over the past 10 years is the denial of service attack. Most organizations have business-critical systems that cannot be unavailable. The denial of service attack looks at targeting these critical systems with so many requests that the application is unable to handle the volume of requests and crashes.</p>
			<p>These incidents are extremely serious and can lead to loss of revenue for organizations, as well as damaging their reputation and customer confidence.</p>
			<h4>Lack of confidentiality</h4>
			<p>Most organizations handle a level of <a id="_idIndexMarker519"/>sensitive information, some more sensitive than others. The majority of organizations handle personal data, even if that is just about employees.</p>
			<p>Some data, including personal data, should be protected and made accessible only by people who are authorized to access that data and are reliable. Many organizations spend large amounts of money before employees start performing background checks to ensure they are reliable individuals.</p>
			<p>The basic rule of information protection is that when this rule of access and trust is not followed, people outside the circle of trust for that data may have access to that data and be able to misuse it.</p>
			<p>To conclude, information <a id="_idIndexMarker520"/>security is incredibly important, and awareness within your organization about who is responsible is also incredibly important. It's quite simple: everyone is responsible for security within your organization; it is the job of the security professionals to hunt, detect, and track down individuals who try and break trust and attempt to infiltrate your networks.</p>
			<p>Now, let's look at the importance of understanding architectural requirements when developing a strategy for tooling.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor220"/>Understanding architectural requirements</h2>
			<p>Now that we have a <a id="_idIndexMarker521"/>solid understanding of enterprise architecture and the role it plays in our organization, let's look at how can we use that to help build a strategy that helps with our tooling choices later down the line.</p>
			<h3>Defining our architectural requirements</h3>
			<p>First of all, let's <a id="_idIndexMarker522"/>define some architectural requirements we can use to align to tooling choices in the DevOps space. Our first requirement is that, where possible, we will buy software as opposed to building it ourselves. Next up is that the system must be able to accept our federated corporate identities. This means support for technology such as OAuth or <strong class="bold">Security Assertion Markup Language</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAML</strong>) so that <a id="_idIndexMarker523"/>we can use single sign-on.</p>
			<p>OAuth is an open standard for access delegation that is commonly used by internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites, without revealing their passwords. On the other hand, SAML is an open standard that allows identity providers to pass authorization credentials to service providers.</p>
			<p>Other requirements include that the software must be able to be deployed to a public cloud provider, and that we must be able to interface with the tool using an API.</p>
			<p>To summarize, this is our shortlist of requirements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Buy software over building it internally.</li>
				<li>Accept federated identity.</li>
				<li>Support deploying to a public cloud provider.</li>
				<li>Interface using an API.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the real <a id="_idIndexMarker524"/>world, many more requirements will be defined, and are set out by enterprise architecture. These requirements help us navigate the choices of tools on the market and naturally help us narrow down our choices.</p>
			<h3>Preparing for architecture reviews</h3>
			<p>Mature organizations that<a id="_idIndexMarker525"/> practice enterprise architecture will also set out the requirement for all new projects to go before a board. This is composed of leaders from parts of the business and is run by enterprise architecture.</p>
			<p>The goal of this board, often called the Architecture Review Board, is to ensure that new software coming into the organization has met the criteria of the enterprise architecture blueprint and can address any additional questions that may come up.</p>
			<p>When you are going through the process of looking at options for tooling, have a member of the enterprise architecture team work with you on it. That way, many of the questions that will be asked at the review board will be asked during your time evaluating tools.</p>
			<p>Overall, this could save you a significant amount of time. Now that we have looked at the importance of architectural and security requirements regarding tooling within your organization, let's look at how you can develop training plans to help your teams adopt new tools.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-222"><a id="_idTextAnchor221"/>Developing training plans to help your team</h1>
			<p>Often, organizations <a id="_idIndexMarker526"/>do not put enough of an emphasis on the requirement for teams to be trained on new tools that are brought into the organization. Training comes in many forms, and you will need to make sure that you cater your training for different teams if multiple teams use your tool and to suit people's styles of learning.</p>
			<p>Considering these things up front, and then putting a plan in place around them, is likely to make your tooling implementation more successful than it would have been without appropriate training plans.</p>
			<p>Now, let's look at the importance of developing training plans within your organization.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-223"><a id="_idTextAnchor222"/>Why are training plans important?</h2>
			<p>Let's take a <a id="_idIndexMarker527"/>professional sportsperson as an example. Their training is fundamentally important to their success. As the training process for professional athletes becomes more detailed, variances arise in their training, such as planning the weather all the way through to preparing for major events. A plan is needed to give you structure, direction, and guidance. Training plans also help you prepare and deal with different factors, such as distractions that can interfere with the plan.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Training plans help you plan ahead, increase staff retention, and increase engagement, as well as helping you stay ahead of competitors.</p>
			<p>Training plans are important in businesses for a number of reasons, but here are a few from the top of my head:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Increasing employee engagement</li>
				<li>Improving staff retention</li>
				<li>Staying ahead of your competitors</li>
				<li>Saving on costs</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's look at these reasons in more detail to look at why training plans are important.</p>
			<h3>Increasing employee engagement</h3>
			<p>Lack of <a id="_idIndexMarker528"/>engagement ultimately leads to issues in retention (more on that next). Keeping your team engaged, especially as a group of technical people, involves training that helps them further their careers.</p>
			<p>If your organization has a good track record of providing quality training opportunities, then your employees stay engaged. They know that when something new comes along, they will get the opportunity to learn.</p>
			<h3>Improving staff retention</h3>
			<p>Anyone <a id="_idIndexMarker529"/>who has spent time managing a team knows that it's inevitable that, in time, one of your team members is going to raise points such as, "I don't know where my career is going" or "I don't think the company values what I do." While comments like these may not be an immediate problem, they lead to people looking at other jobs, which leads to interviews, and then offers.</p>
			<p>Planning ahead, and then communicating those training plans so that your team knows how their training over that period will be aligned with your organization's objectives, helps them put things into perspective.</p>
			<h3>Staying ahead of your competitors</h3>
			<p>Objectives <a id="_idIndexMarker530"/>are usually built around growth, market share, delivering products and services, or increasing sales. You can still attach training goals to those objectives, and your training plan should reflect those goals.</p>
			<p>Design what your teams need to know in advance; that is, what they need to make them and you successful. When you get to that critical point where that knowledge or those skills are needed, your successful training plans mean that employees already have those skills.</p>
			<h3>Saving on costs</h3>
			<p>Doesn't everyone<a id="_idIndexMarker531"/> like to save money? As a summary, really, when you are recruiting, you can bring someone in with all the knowledge you need as opposed to someone internal who acquires that knowledge over time. It is cheaper for someone to acquire that knowledge than it is to hire someone who knows it.</p>
			<p>Planning will help you spend your training budget more efficiently. You can plan in advance for what you need and when and use people internally where you can, but in short, when it comes to developing your team, planning is always key.</p>
			<p>Now, let's look at how you can develop training plans for teams in your organization.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-224"><a id="_idTextAnchor223"/>How to develop training plans for your teams</h2>
			<p>Developing<a id="_idIndexMarker532"/> training plans is actually a fairly well-defined process. Training plans should just be a part of your entire organization's training program, which should be in place already.</p>
			<p>Developing an effective plan involves the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Identify the training needs</li>
				<li>Review the adult learning principles</li>
				<li>Develop objectives for the individual</li>
				<li>Design or seek out appropriate training</li>
				<li>Plan when the training will take place</li>
				<li>Have employees sign off on the plan</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Let's look at these steps in more detail to understand how we can develop training plans.</p>
			<h3>Identify the training needs</h3>
			<p>You should consider the differences in teams using tools. If multiple teams are using the tool, then not every team will be using the tool in the same way. Before developing your plan, perform an audit of existing skills, and then work out what you and your employees need before you start planning.</p>
			<p>If you develop a plan that does not provide any value, people will not be engaged and won't see the value, no matter how hard you try.</p>
			<h3>Review the adult learning principles</h3>
			<p>It sounds obvious, but bear in mind that adults learn differently from children. Your training plan needs to reflect this. You need to make sure training will keep people engaged; don't plan training that just runs through PowerPoint slides.</p>
			<p>Most adults learn by self-directing, and the choices they make are relevant to their personal objectives. Adult learning is also heavily goal-oriented, so make sure your training is aligned with the objectives of the business, both personally and professionally.</p>
			<p>The life experience that's gained by adults when it comes to training is also important, as this experience can help shape their future training. These previous experiences help determine your preferred learning style.</p>
			<h3>Develop objectives for the individual</h3>
			<p>Developing <a id="_idIndexMarker533"/>objectives with your training plans is important because if you don't, you don't know exactly where you want to go, and the training probably won't work. Having a final end goal is a start, but you need milestones along the way to make sure you are heading in the right direction.</p>
			<p>Learning objectives should fundamentally define what you want employees to understand and, most importantly, be able to do at the end of the training process. At the end of training, employees should know what they can do now that they couldn't before they took on the training.</p>
			<h3>Design or seek out appropriate training</h3>
			<p>Try and look internally for a subject expert that may be able to help you deliver any training. Failing that, you may be able to find suitable material you can use already on the internet. In other instances, you may need to have a trainer come in and help train your employees.</p>
			<p>During this step, consider the learning styles of employees and how that might affect what you class as appropriate training.</p>
			<p>Separate training so that there is a clear definition between your soft skills and hard skills. Hard skills would be classed as technical skills in a new product or tool, while soft skills would be things such as communication, diversity, or harassment training.</p>
			<h3>Plan when the training will take place</h3>
			<p>As a manager, make sure your team is fully aware that they have dedicated learning time available to take training as required. You should actively encourage your employees to make use of the time that's been set aside for them and make commitments so that when training is booked in, it will not be moved. Often, training is one of the first things to get postponed or moved around due to operational challenges. Do what you can to ensure this is not the case.</p>
			<p>You should use a tool or even just a spreadsheet to track the training that people have signed up for, completed, and intend to take.</p>
			<h3>Have employees sign off on the plan</h3>
			<p>Keep track<a id="_idIndexMarker534"/> of your training program and ensure that all your employees have completed the necessary modules. You can implement a training program that begins as soon as new employees are hired that focuses on health and safety, company culture, and general procedures. It is critical to obtain feedback from employees who have completed a specific program and for them to sign off on their training.</p>
			<p>Now that you understand why training plans are important and how to develop and implement them in your organization, let's look at defining owners and processes for your tooling.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-225"><a id="_idTextAnchor224"/>Defining owners and processes for tooling</h1>
			<p>For tooling to be effective, it really needs<a id="_idIndexMarker535"/> two fundamental things. The first is an owner for that tool, while the second is for processes to be defined and documented for that tool.</p>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker536"/> owners of your tooling are responsible for defining how the tool <a id="_idIndexMarker537"/>is used, what scenarios it helps resolve, defining <a id="_idIndexMarker538"/>processes for how to use parts of the tool, and providing ownership in terms of the infrastructure and any costs behind it. You may split tool ownership between business ownership to manage the costs, infrastructure required, or license costs and a technical owner who looks after the knowledge articles and processes for how to use the tool.</p>
			<p>Considerations should be made regarding the tool's life cycle at this point as well. While talking about test tooling, the following article from <em class="italic">Cania Consulting</em> (<a href="https://cania-consulting.com/2019/10/25/software-testing-tool-basics/#Testing_tool_life_cycle">https://cania-consulting.com/2019/10/25/software-testing-tool-basics/#Testing_tool_life_cycle</a>) provides a good explanation of the tool's life cycle.</p>
			<p>Now, let's look at how to identify the owners of tools within your organization.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-226"><a id="_idTextAnchor225"/>Identifying the owners of tools in your organization</h2>
			<p>If your <a id="_idIndexMarker539"/>organization is lucky enough to have an asset management team, then most of the business ownership may fall with them for any tooling that you bring in. License ownership would generally sit with asset management as a centralized team.</p>
			<p>Technical ownership is not as clear as you might think. Sure, if one team uses a tool, then the ownership of that tool from a day-to-day perspective would sit with that team. Consider a scenario where the tool is more foundational and is used by many different teams.</p>
			<p>In that scenario, you will find that the ownership of the tool generally sits with the central IT teams. In many organizations, this would traditionally be true, but with the adoption of DevOps tooling and the transformations going on within teams, many central IT teams are reluctant to own and manage tools they don't use.</p>
			<p>In this scenario, central IT teams will provide underlying support for the tool if required, though this won't be needed in scenarios where the tool is PaaS or SaaS. The teams using the application daily will then be granted ownership of the application and assume those responsibilities.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-227"><a id="_idTextAnchor226"/>Mapping processes to tools</h2>
			<p>Consider the<a id="_idIndexMarker540"/> processes that are needed to successfully <a id="_idIndexMarker541"/>operate your tool. You will need to think about traditional processes such as how users are onboarded to your tool and how their access and permissions are managed, all the way to how you remove people from the tool.</p>
			<p>In addition, think about what problem the tool is trying to solve and the manual processes that it will automate. They need to be documented in detail so that if the automation process fails, people know what it's replacing and where to look to fix a problem.</p>
			<p>Other processes you will need to think about include documenting the importance of the tool. This helps build up a picture of what the tool supports and how fundamental it is to the business. Also, think about how the tool should be updated and when it is used so that when it is updated, the service is not taken out for other important processes.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-228"><a id="_idTextAnchor227"/>Making tooling part of process improvement</h2>
			<p>We have <a id="_idIndexMarker542"/>spoken about the importance of continuous feedback and continuous improvement several times now. Tooling should not be exempt from this cycle. It is as important to include your tooling in process improvement activities as it is the process.</p>
			<p>Look at your processes that use value stream mapping; for example, it could be that the tooling is causing a delay or lead time in the process that you are trying to fix. In that context, you may need to make adjustments to the tooling for it to work correctly.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-229"><a id="_idTextAnchor228"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we understood the architectural and security requirements that need to be considered when looking at a tooling strategy. We also looked at why enterprise architecture and information security are important, how to develop training plans for your organizations, and how to identify owners and processes for your tooling.</p>
			<p>Using these skills, you can now implement a strategy and process for DevOps tooling in your organization, as well as developing solid training plans that will allow your teams to get up to speed with the new tools.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we'll look at the various trends that are closely aligned with DevOps, such as DataOps, DevSecOps, and GitOps. We will look at what they are and the tools that help deliver value in those XOps scenarios.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-230"><a id="_idTextAnchor229"/>Questions</h2>
