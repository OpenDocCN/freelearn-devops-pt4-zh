    The most obvious is the top-down view of systems within the enterprise. This alone
    makes enterprise architecture invaluable when it comes to managing the complexities
    involved with many businesses.
  prefs: []

    of IT and operating from the ivory tower. In recent years, this view has changed
    dramatically. Instead of enterprise architecture just being thought of as a function
    of IT, it now plays a pivotal role in bridging the gap that exists between the
    business and IT.

    a foundational and supporting role, it is now more progressive and outcome-focused

    for services and applications. A strategy and roadmap for enterprise architecture
    will define blueprints for deploying services, a list of things services must
    have before they will be considered for service. It also defines the platforms
    that the organization will use in the short, mid, and long term.

    and, most importantly, be able to do at the end of the training process. At the
    end of training, employees should know what they can do now that they couldn't

    time available to take training as required. You should actively encourage your
    employees to make use of the time that's been set aside for them and make commitments
    so that when training is booked in, it will not be moved. Often, training is one
    of the first things to get postponed or moved around due to operational challenges.

    as soon as new employees are hired that focuses on health and safety, company

    who have completed a specific program and for them to sign off on their training.

    is an owner for that tool, while the second is for processes to be defined and
    documented for that tool.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The owners of your tooling are responsible for defining how the tool is used,
    what scenarios it helps resolve, defining processes for how to use parts of the
    tool, and providing ownership in terms of the infrastructure and any costs behind
    it. You may split tool ownership between business ownership to manage the costs,
    infrastructure required, or license costs and a technical owner who looks after
    the knowledge articles and processes for how to use the tool.

    as well. While talking about test tooling, the following article from *Cania Consulting*

- en: If your organization is lucky enough to have an asset management team, then
    most of the business ownership may fall with them for any tooling that you bring
    in. License ownership would generally sit with asset management as a centralized
    team.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Technical ownership is not as clear as you might think. Sure, if one team uses
    a tool, then the ownership of that tool from a day-to-day perspective would sit
    with that team. Consider a scenario where the tool is more foundational and is
    used by many different teams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In that scenario, you will find that the ownership of the tool generally sits
    with the central IT teams. In many organizations, this would traditionally be
    true, but with the adoption of DevOps tooling and the transformations going on
    within teams, many central IT teams are reluctant to own and manage tools they
    don't use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this scenario, central IT teams will provide underlying support for the tool
    if required, though this won't be needed in scenarios where the tool is PaaS or
    SaaS. The teams using the application daily will then be granted ownership of
    the application and assume those responsibilities.

    will need to think about traditional processes such as how users are onboarded
    to your tool and how their access and permissions are managed, all the way to
    how you remove people from the tool.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, think about what problem the tool is trying to solve and the manual
    processes that it will automate. They need to be documented in detail so that
    if the automation process fails, people know what it's replacing and where to
    look to fix a problem.

- en: Other processes you will need to think about include documenting the importance
    of the tool. This helps build up a picture of what the tool supports and how fundamental
    it is to the business. Also, think about how the tool should be updated and when
    it is used so that when it is updated, the service is not taken out for other
    important processes.

    several times now. Tooling should not be exempt from this cycle. It is as important
    to include your tooling in process improvement activities as it is the process.

    be that the tooling is causing a delay or lead time in the process that you are
    trying to fix. In that context, you may need to make adjustments to the tooling
    for it to work correctly.
