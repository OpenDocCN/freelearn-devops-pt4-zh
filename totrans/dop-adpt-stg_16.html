			<h1 id="_idParaDest-247"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor246"/>Chapter 12</em>: Implementing DevOps in a Real-World Organization</h1>
			<p>Using everything we have learned so far, in this chapter we will look at putting everything into practice and see how you might implement DevOps in a real-world organization. Using a fictitious organization, we will set out problem statements, define what their goals are, and then look at how we can help that company adapt and change, starting on the road to DevOps transformation.</p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will have learned how to combine all the elements we have covered in the book and put them together to practice a real-world transformation to DevOps.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding why organizations move to DevOps</li>
				<li>Defining our fictional organization</li>
				<li>Walk-through of a sample DevOps transformation</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-248"><a id="_idTextAnchor247"/>Understanding why organizations move to DevOps</h1>
			<p>In <a href="B17192_01_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor012"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introducing DevOps and Agile</em>, we discussed the goals of DevOps, as well as some of the values of DevOps and the challenges that DevOps will help us solve. What about why organizations <a id="_idIndexMarker592"/>move to DevOps? This is a question we will now look at in more detail.</p>
			<p>According to the <em class="italic">2019 DORA State of DevOps Report</em> (https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops), top performers in DevOps deliver code faster, have fewer bugs, and resolve incidents more quickly. Some of the highlights from that report include the following statistics backing up the previous statement:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>208 times more frequent code deployments</li>
				<li>106 times faster lead time from commit to deploy</li>
				<li>2,604 times faster time to recover from incidents</li>
				<li>7 times lower change failure rate</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Organizations that embrace DevOps practices simply get more done. By utilizing a single team comprising<a id="_idIndexMarker593"/> cross-functional members all working in collaboration, DevOps organizations can deliver with maximum speed, functionality, and innovation.</p>
			<p>In <a href="B17192_02_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor038"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Business Benefits, Team Topologies, and Pitfalls of DevOps</em>, we focused on looking at the key business benefits of DevOps. However, you can put the benefits associated with DevOps into three clear buckets:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Business benefits</li>
				<li>Technical benefits</li>
				<li>Cultural benefits</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When we talked about business benefits, we covered things that make a business tick; things such as a boost in productivity, better-quality products, and improved employee retention were three of these reasons. Also, there are things that directly contribute to the success of the business, such as improved growth, customer satisfaction, and customer experience.</p>
			<p>Let's now look at some of the technical and cultural benefits your organization can expect to achieve from implementing DevOps.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-249"><a id="_idTextAnchor248"/>Technical benefits</h2>
			<p>You could list numerous <a id="_idIndexMarker594"/>technical benefits associated with DevOps. However, when you are working toward DevOps transformation, it is important to not focus on the minute details too much and to try and keep your eye on the broader benefits. The reason for this is that often those smaller benefits, while beneficial to you or your team, may not be broader benefits for other teams, the department, or your organization.</p>
			<p>Keeping that organizational view will ensure you get maximum buy-in. Teams across the organization will feel similar benefits specific to their team, and that is great, but you must focus on the bigger benefits.</p>
			<p>Three benefits stand out for me as critical and align with the preceding scenario of thinking about the bigger picture. They are continuous software delivery, faster resolution of problems, and less complexity. This also presents the opportunity to provide more proactive and reactive management of technical debt.</p>
			<p>Continuous integration and continuous deployment and delivery are cornerstones of DevOps and are clear technical benefits. When implemented correctly, not only do they provide you clear benefits around the building and deployment of your applications but they provide a means to catch bad practices during development, as well as catching security issues and threats along the way.</p>
			<p>With the practices employed in DevOps, you are making your environment less complex. This reduction in complexity is attractive to organizations as well as individual teams. The best thing is <a id="_idIndexMarker595"/>that the reduction in complexity can be in a number of areas, such as your workflows, meaning you've automated manual tasks; it could be in the production of documentation, for example. It also means removing unnecessary steps from your processes. This comes in the form of value stream mapping exercises to identify and remove them from your operation.</p>
			<p>Finally, with the improvement in the monitoring of your application and infrastructure that comes with DevOps also comes site reliability engineering, which is to do with the ability to recover<a id="_idIndexMarker596"/> from failures quickly. <strong class="bold">Site reliability engineering</strong> (<strong class="bold">SRE</strong>) is a discipline that applies aspects of software engineering to infrastructure and operations problems.</p>
			<p>The level of telemetry provided and the shared understanding between teams on the application and infrastructure supports the application as well as the goals set out by the teams.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-250"><a id="_idTextAnchor249"/>Cultural benefits</h2>
			<p>Throughout the chapters, we have <a id="_idIndexMarker597"/>talked heavily about the influence of culture in DevOps. Culture in DevOps is what binds our teams together. Happier, more productive teams; greater professional development opportunities; and higher employee engagement are three of the big cultural benefits you can achieve from a successful implementation of DevOps.</p>
			<p>I just talked about the shared responsibilities in teams that come with DevOps. This is a big driver for cultural benefits. When teams are invested in shared responsibilities, common goals, and driving vision, this creates a culturally sound working environment that drives happier teams that are more productive.</p>
			<p>One further benefit to this is the higher employee engagement from the good culture that DevOps can breed. We are taught in DevOps the notions "fail fast" and "growth mindset." Both of these mean employees are more likely to voice their ideas and be open with each other because the focus is not on blame; the focus is on making things better and sharing ideas to achieve the common goal.</p>
			<p>Finally, when <a id="_idIndexMarker598"/>you put all of these things together, you broaden the skills of your team quite naturally. You provide people with the tools and the capabilities to expand their knowledge and further their careers. Organizations with true career growth opportunities are one of the biggest things new hires will look for. DevOps can help your organization be attractive for new hires.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-251"><a id="_idTextAnchor250"/>Balancing stability against new features</h2>
			<p>In a non-DevOps environment, there is <a id="_idIndexMarker599"/>often a conflict between releasing new features and maintaining stability. The development team is evaluated based on the number of updates delivered to users, whereas the operations team is evaluated based on the overall health of the system.</p>
			<p>In a DevOps environment, everyone on the team is responsible for delivering new features as well as stability. Because code isn't <em class="italic">thrown over the wall</em> to operations at the end of development, the combination of a shared code base, continuous integration, test-driven techniques, and automated deployments, among other things, exposes issues in application code, infrastructure, or configuration earlier in the process.</p>
			<p>Because change sets are smaller, problems tend to be less complex. DevOps engineers can use real-time data on system performance to quickly understand the impact of application changes. And resolution times are reduced because team members do not have to wait for a different team to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-252"><a id="_idTextAnchor251"/>Increased effectiveness</h2>
			<p>In a typical IT environment, there<a id="_idIndexMarker600"/> is enormous waste as people wait for other people and other machines—or they are stuck solving the same problems over and over. Employees prefer to be productive, and time spent churning causes frustration and unhappiness. Everyone benefits when people can spend less time on unsatisfying aspects of their jobs and more time on adding value to the organization.</p>
			<p>Key aspects of DevOps models of IT operations are automated deployments and standardized production environments, which make deployments predictable and free people from routine <a id="_idIndexMarker601"/>repetitive tasks to do more high-value things. For example, a large financial services firm with over 4,000 IT employees saved over $8 million by implementing DevOps, which reduced MTTR and eliminated legacy tool maintenance.</p>
			<p>Now we have looked more broadly at the reasons organizations move to DevOps. Let's now define our fictional organization to look at the implementation of a DevOps transformation.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-253"><a id="_idTextAnchor252"/>Defining our fictional organization</h1>
			<p>Before we look at <a id="_idIndexMarker602"/>our transformation journey, let's first define the organization we are working with. I would like to introduce you all to <em class="italic">Travelics</em>. Through <a id="_idIndexMarker603"/>early discussions with Travelics, we have found out some usual details from them:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Global organization based in Europe and North America.</li>
				<li>Employs around 4,000 employees.</li>
				<li>Produces two products for the aviation industry, one focused on baggage tracking and one on operational insights.</li>
				<li>Both products have teams of around 15 developers.</li>
				<li>Operations is a shared entity and part of central IT.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we have established some fundamentals about Travelics, let's move into learning some more specifics about them and what they are trying to achieve.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-254"><a id="_idTextAnchor253"/>Current operating model</h2>
			<p>Travelics' current <a id="_idIndexMarker604"/>operating model is that customers drive feature requests to the software engineering teams. The process of doing this is via engagement with account managers as well as industry experience from engineers on the team. All requests are centrally managed and distributed to teams responsible for that feature. The work is undertaken and queued for release.</p>
			<p>The operations team is a shared entity that is part of the central IT team. They rely on documentation from the development team to troubleshoot the application. The application is currently undergoing a transformation from being a monolithic application that is deployed on <a id="_idIndexMarker605"/>virtual machines in a public cloud environment to being one that is more cloud-native and relies on microservices and multi-tenanted software as a service model.</p>
			<p>Currently, virtual machines are deployed for each new client and if the client buys both software packages, these will sit on separate instances.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-255"><a id="_idTextAnchor254"/>Challenges that exist within the current model</h2>
			<p>The current <a id="_idIndexMarker606"/>ways of working provide a number of challenges for Travelics. The biggest is that they are not agile enough in how they deliver their applications. Releases only happen twice a year; this often results in failures at deployment and rollback of the application while the issues are resolved. This outage can often be around four hours.</p>
			<p>Another issue is the quality of code: developers are highly skilled but there is a general lack of review and oversight of each other's work. This leads to bugs, and the engineering teams have a large list of technical debt that needs addressing.</p>
			<p>The lack of scalability and cloud-native approach is also limiting. This provides serious operational challenges and results in different configuration approaches for different customers; versions of the application are not consistent across all customers and some customers also have unsupported versions deployed as they are unwilling to allow the company to upgrade them over the fear of outages.</p>
			<p>Understanding of DevOps varies throughout the engineering organization, and outside of engineering, not many employees may understand DevOps. Pockets of people understand what DevOps is, but there is general hesitancy to move toward a different model.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-256"><a id="_idTextAnchor255"/>Goals for the future</h2>
			<p>A driving factor for <a id="_idIndexMarker607"/>change is the introduction of a new organization providing similar services. This disruptor is much smaller but is able to deliver new features quickly and runs a completely "software as a service" solution. Travelics has lost three large customers already to this competitor. They believe that with changes, they can address these problems and compete once again.</p>
			<p>Travelics has the following<a id="_idIndexMarker608"/> goals for their DevOps transformation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Clear vision for the development of the products</li>
				<li>Agility that allows teams to work independently but share practices</li>
				<li>Focus on faster releases and increased quality</li>
				<li>Increase customer satisfaction</li>
				<li>Realize new features more quickly</li>
				<li>Reduce the amount of failures</li>
				<li>Move to a more modern platform capable of scaling</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In summary, our DevOps transformation for Travelics needs to look at the organization from top to bottom. This includes how the teams are structured as well as how they operate. These changes will be fundamental to how Travelics works and, if successful, will make a big difference to the way they operate.</p>
			<p>Let's now begin the DevOps transformation journey for Travelics.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-257"><a id="_idTextAnchor256"/>Walk-through of DevOps transformation</h1>
			<p>Now we<a id="_idIndexMarker609"/> understand the outline of the Travelics organization, as well as their current situation and aspirations and goals for the future. We can start engaging with them on making their goals a reality.</p>
			<p>A number of steps exist for a successful transformation; it's a long process. The complexities involved in transforming large enterprises necessitate buy-in at the highest level to make this successful and implement the changes that are required. The steps you would look to take for a<a id="_idIndexMarker610"/> transformation would be as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Have initial planning workshops.</li>
				<li>Establish a DevOps Center of Excellence.</li>
				<li>Set up governance of the transformation.</li>
				<li>Establish an intake process.</li>
				<li>Identify and initiate pilots.</li>
				<li>Assess current capabilities.</li>
				<li>Perform transformation exercises.</li>
				<li>Scale out the DevOps transformation.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now, let's look at these steps in more detail and discuss the specifics we need to do with Travelics to achieve their goals.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-258"><a id="_idTextAnchor257"/>Having initial planning workshops</h2>
			<p>Participants must include all of the<a id="_idIndexMarker611"/> towers that comprise the solution delivery. Along with operations, security, and development, business participation is required. I always recommend that the workshops in this step be led by an experienced external consultant or coach. The key here is to gain executive support and to establish common goals and understanding of what a DevOps program will entail:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer046" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_12_01.jpg" alt="Figure 12.1 – Diagram showing the inputs and outputs of your initial planning&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.1 – Diagram showing the inputs and outputs of your initial planning</p>
			<p>For Travelics, the<a id="_idIndexMarker612"/> initial planning is really important. Remember we said that other than a few pockets of people, many people do not understand DevOps, and with this comes some hesitancy to move to a new way of working.</p>
			<p>Typically, several small DevOps programs exist in silos and lack the maturity to scale to the enterprise level. Design thinking is an excellent method to employ because it capitalizes on the expertise of all stakeholders, enables them to reach a common understanding, and establishes the necessary buy-in.</p>
			<p>Now we will look at the elements needed to build a DevOps center of excellence, which is a critical step in the adoption of DevOps.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-259"><a id="_idTextAnchor258"/>Establishing a DevOps Center of Excellence</h2>
			<p>Creating a <strong class="bold">Center of Excellence</strong> (<strong class="bold">CoE</strong>) is inadequate<a id="_idIndexMarker613"/> if it is not at the appropriate organizational level and<a id="_idIndexMarker614"/> enterprise authority. It must be led by a business leader who has the support and buy-in of all towers. Representatives from all delivery towers, as well as vendor organizations, are active participants in the CoE. These participants must be chosen with caution.</p>
			<p>Building on the diagram in <em class="italic">Figure 12.1</em>, we can now add several other elements to it as we define the stakeholders needed and more tightly define the outputs. </p>
			<p>You should note the<a id="_idIndexMarker615"/> timeline is pointing down in the diagram; this means starting your conversations at the top. For the transformational challenges faced by Travelics, my recommendation would be having either the CEO or COO be responsible from a sponsorship perspective in the transformation.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">Although the timeline is top down, there is nothing wrong with gaining sponsorship from the bottom up as well. This is just a formal way of establishing a formal CoE.</p>
			<p>Starting from day one of the transformation, executives from the software engineering teams and senior leaders from operations, development, and even the CTO or CIO should be involved in those early discussions.</p>
			<p>The output of this stage is to establish a common mindset for the DevOps transformation. This will be establishing common goals, objectives, and priorities for the work that needs to be done.</p>
			<p>Around three to five days into the process, our discussion needs to evolve to a further level of detail and include the program owner, who is also a sponsor of the project. This needs to include representatives from the following areas:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Application owners</li>
				<li>Enterprise architecture</li>
				<li>Solution architects</li>
				<li>Development leads</li>
				<li>Operations leads</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Over the next two weeks, workshops take place with Travelics to perform value stream mapping of the software development life cycle. The goal of this is to further understand in detail the current state of the organization, development state, detailed delivery processes, and any key performance indicators currently attributed to performance.</p>
			<p>These workshops at this stage also look to expand out of areas that are to be prioritized from an impact perspective. Given the needs described about Travelics, which do you think is a priority area for them?</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">Travelics are losing customers and experiencing issues due to quality. This dictates that an immediate area for improvement is customer satisfaction and the quality of releases.</p>
			<p>Finally, somewhere <a id="_idIndexMarker616"/>around 20 days into the initial planning process, the same group of people as before come back around the table to look at a deep dive into how engineering will look at the end of the process.</p>
			<p>Taking into account everything that we know about Travelics and their high-level goals and ambitions, this should drive these workshops forward and help provide the detail needed to form a plan and direction of travel.</p>
			<p>The expected outputs from these final planning workshops would expect to produce future state mapping and reference architecture for DevOps. At this point, we should have at least a draft of an implementation roadmap with high-level targets introduced.</p>
			<p>One thing that is clear at this stage is that the current team structure is not fit for purpose and does not align with the goals of Travelics. Therefore, outputs also include the proposed structure for the teams going forward as well as defining any roles and responsibilities.</p>
			<p>The final part of this section includes creating a business case for moving forward with the transformation and an executive summary of what the proposal contains.</p>
			<p>I strongly advise that the initial phases of the CoE be led by an external experienced partner and then transitioned over time. The initial phases aid in the consolidation of the CoE's vision and strategies, as well as the establishment of best practices to support them. Typically, it takes 12 to 24 months to transition from business partner to internal stakeholders.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-260"><a id="_idTextAnchor259"/>Setting up governance of the transformation</h2>
			<p>This is the <a id="_idIndexMarker617"/>most important step in changing the organization's culture. The roles and responsibilities of practitioners will change as a result of Agile and DevOps. To succeed, they will require awareness, enablement, and empowerment. It is critical that they understand the collaboration between organizations that have historically had animosity between them in order to break down these organizational walls. KPIs must shift away from individual metrics and toward overall customer business outcomes.</p>
			<p>Establishing governance is not as hard as it is made to sound. Your program governance consists of three main things: communication plans, an enablement program, and established KPIs.</p>
			<p>Your communication<a id="_idIndexMarker618"/> plan involves frequently publicizing your program objectives, milestones, and successes. From an enablement perspective, this needs to be looking at Agile fundamentals for your business leaders, so they understand the critical elements. Enablement also includes starting to look at platform and toolchain education for those teams as well as deeper training on DevOps approaches such as continuous integration, continuous deployment, continuous testing, and continuous feedback and improvement.</p>
			<p>Finally, your KPIs must come from solid key metrics, a good strategy to measure, and a frequent and detailed reporting cadence as well as milestones for the transformation.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-261"><a id="_idTextAnchor260"/>Establishing an intake process</h2>
			<p>The first sprint that <a id="_idIndexMarker619"/>onboards the program sets the tone for the rest of the sprints. It is not so much a matter of tools and processes as it is of the proper sizing of tools and processes. The selection of accelerators, tool chains, and development methods must be fit for purpose. Once established, the intake process must be communicated throughout the organization. Collect feedback and evolve and mature on a continuous basis.</p>
			<p>Reusable assets are key to having an effective intake process. Architectural patterns, automation scripts, operational cookbooks, and infrastructure assets are all critical assets that can be defined and agreed once and reused in multiple different scenarios.</p>
			<p>The success of sprints comes down to best practices. These best practices help enforce consistency and help provide repeatable results across not only pilot teams but also for when the transformation is scaled up. Ensuring you have defined practices for trunk-based development patterns, branching and merging strategies for your source control, and test automation patterns and processes around test-driven development as well as continuous integration are keys to success at this stage.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-262"><a id="_idTextAnchor261"/>Identifying and initiating pilots</h2>
			<p>When applied to a <a id="_idIndexMarker620"/>specific portfolio of applications or a domain solution, this step has the best chance of success. Prior to this workshop, I strongly advise opening some working sessions to identify an area of development work that<a id="_idIndexMarker621"/> represents a portfolio to scale to the enterprise.</p>
			<p>The goal of this step is to conduct a value stream mapping exercise with participants from all towers for a specific application. This must be done in sufficient detail to identify the current end-to-end process, tooling, manual and automated processes, as well as the skills and people involved.</p>
			<p>The collaboration of <strong class="bold">subject matter experts</strong> (<strong class="bold">SMEs</strong>) from the CoE with the project team is the next <a id="_idIndexMarker622"/>step in the project intake process. The goal is to provide advice on the "to-be" process, including the necessary tooling, reusable assets, automation, and SMEs from operations, security, and other relevant areas. The application Scrum team will be made up of these SMEs. Identified KPIs for the program are captured as the application goes through its development/test cycle. This is absolutely required for comparison with existing KPIs.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-263"><a id="_idTextAnchor262"/>Assessment of current capabilities</h2>
			<p>Understanding <a id="_idIndexMarker623"/>the pockets of DevOps that exist in your organization is really important. Some of those pockets may be more mature than you realize, and you may be able to take some of the good practices already in place and use them in other parts of your transformation.</p>
			<p>These assessments can be done in a number of ways, but it needs to be something that is repeatable, as you will need to reuse these assessments throughout your transformation in order to check your progress and realign if needed. Assessments need to be broad and detailed.</p>
			<p>Over time, the ambition should be to run assessments with the team, have them score each question using a set of cards, and discuss the scores among the team to agree on actions for improvement.</p>
			<p>One of the best assessments I have found is one from Marc Hornbeek who is the founder of <em class="italic">Engineering DevOps</em> (https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/1c453e6b-8ce5-4e3d-a110-bba77def37c3/downloads/DevOps%20Practices%20Maturity%20Assessment%20v2.xlsx?ver=1619731527627). This assessment is comprehensive and free to use. It covers in detail the nine pillars of a <a id="_idIndexMarker624"/>DevOps practice, which include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Collaborative culture practices</li>
				<li>Continuous security practices</li>
				<li>Continuous monitoring practices</li>
				<li>Design for DevOps practices</li>
				<li>Continuous delivery practices</li>
				<li>Elastic infrastructure practices</li>
				<li>Continuous testing practices</li>
				<li>Continuous integration practices</li>
				<li>Collaborative leadership practices</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These comprehensive questions give a rounded view of performance. Using the same assessment provides you with a clear view of improvement in performance over time and something you can look back on to track over time:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer047" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_12_02.jpg" alt="Figure 12.2 – Example output from a maturity assessment&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.2 – Example output from a maturity assessment</p>
			<p>As you can see<a id="_idIndexMarker625"/> from the preceding diagram, the output provides us with a comprehensive snapshot. Each question has the ability to set the importance of that question to your organization and assess your current score. The top bar in the group indicates your maturity score in this area:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer048" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17192_12_03.jpg" alt="Figure 12.3 – Example detailed output from maturity assessment&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.3 – Example detailed output from maturity assessment</p>
			<p>The output also<a id="_idIndexMarker626"/> provides a per pillar view of your maturity. This gives you an idea of the priority areas by calculating the level of importance against the current score, meaning the lowest score becomes the highest area for improvement.</p>
			<p>Periodically, we should also look at performing more detailed assessments as well. This change-up asks different questions and challenges in certain other focus areas. The more detailed assessment looks at the following areas:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>DevOps training practices</li>
				<li>DevOps governance practices</li>
				<li>DevOps value stream management practices</li>
				<li>DevOps application performance monitoring practices</li>
				<li>DevOps SRE practices</li>
				<li>DevOps service catalog practices</li>
				<li>DevOps application release automation practices</li>
				<li>DevOps multi-cloud practices</li>
				<li>DevOps Infrastructure as Code practices</li>
				<li>DevOps hybrid cloud practices</li>
				<li>DevOps version management practices</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This highly detailed assessment takes a while to run. When running this with teams previously, I would set aside a morning to complete the discussions and include time for breaks to keep <a id="_idIndexMarker627"/>people fresh.</p>
			<p>In a similar way to the nine-pillar output, the output from the detailed assessment is the same in providing a sample chart documenting maturity and a table overview looking at highlighting areas of priority focus:</p>

			<p>Other assessments for specific roles are also available at the <em class="italic">Engineering DevOps</em> (<a href="https://engineeringdevops.com/documents#bf990569-1a3f-4eb4-bb3b-73073abf8a31">https://engineeringdevops.com/documents#bf990569-1a3f-4eb4-bb3b-73073abf8a31</a>) website. These<a id="_idIndexMarker628"/> are incredibly useful resources to assist with your transformation and improvement journeys.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-264"><a id="_idTextAnchor263"/>Performing transformation exercises</h2>
			<p>Performing the<a id="_idIndexMarker629"/> action tasks that need to be executed to move the transformation forward obviously depends on the output of the planning workshops. Looking back at our example of Travelics, let's now look at some tasks we<a id="_idIndexMarker630"/> would do to aid with their DevOps transformation.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Chocolate, LEGO, and Scrum game</li>
				<li>Introduction to Agile</li>
				<li>Transforming to Agile working</li>
				<li>Reorganizing the team structure</li>
				<li>Looking at process improvement</li>
				<li>Implementing DevOps practices</li>
				<li>Getting on the feedback loop</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's now look at these areas specifically to look at how we would help Travelics achieve their goals.</p>
			<h3>Chocolate, LEGO, and Scrum game</h3>
			<p>The initial<a id="_idIndexMarker631"/> workshops provide an opportunity to level set on DevOps with a wider audience and to gain trust with the people you are working with. Consider using a simulation workshop rather than running through slides to promote the benefits of DevOps.</p>
			<p>In order to do this, I would consider the <em class="italic">Chocolate, LEGO, and Scrum</em> game by Dana Pylayeva (https://www.slideshare.net/danapylayeva/introduction-to-devops-with-lego-and-choco). The simulation game provides participants with the opportunity to hear the same real-world struggles they face and then act out scenarios that remove these blockers so they can see the results of removing them.</p>
			<p>This is a powerful exercise that, in my experience, is more powerful than a simple slide deck explaining the benefits of DevOps. The aim of the game is for people to sit in groups, then<a id="_idIndexMarker632"/> using a set of role cards that determine the specific activities, people can run through time-boxed exercises we call sprints.</p>
			<p>The aim is to sell LEGO animals on the marketplace and produce as many as you can that meet the requirements stated. As each sprint begins, roles change and blockers are removed, improving the chances of delivering more.</p>
			<h3>Introduction to Agile</h3>
			<p>In this session, aimed at <a id="_idIndexMarker633"/>operations teams within Travelics, we are directly appealing to people who are generally more swayed against Agile. Development teams, in my experience, are more likely to be comfortable with Agile working. The principles are born out of software engineering; that does not mean that you cannot work with operations teams, though.</p>
			<p>It is a common misconception that operations teams cannot operate in an Agile manner. In my opinion and experience, this is simply not true. I will shortly explain why and how we can address some of the common concerns of operations teams who are working to Agile methods. We start by asking three simple questions (and each attendee has a stack of sticky notes):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Why is it worth doing?</li>
				<li>How is it difficult?</li>
				<li>What is Agile?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each attendee is then given around five minutes to write down answers and put them under the appropriate heading. Then we head to a discussion with the team, talk about the notes they have written down, and try and get an open conversation going. When appropriate, anyone running the workshop can then use experience in this field to provide examples to back up or counter the discussion.</p>
			<p>If possible, invite someone from a team that is already on an Agile transformation or already practices some of the qualities we are trying to highlight. Look to invite someone this team trusts; they will value their opinion more than yours at this stage. Luckily, we have someone at Travelics who matches this profile. They had difficulty closing work down after development and an element of their work was ticket-based. For this reason, our CoE asked for someone from the other team to come in and join the discussion.</p>
			<p>This worked well for<a id="_idIndexMarker634"/> several reasons, mainly because the team we were delivering the workshop to had someone from another team who was going through this transformation and could attest to the things we were saying. Mostly, this individual could attest that this process works and it's worth paying more than just lip service to.</p>
			<h3>Transformation to Agile working</h3>
			<p>The plan to<a id="_idIndexMarker635"/> transform the team comes in three steps. Individually, the steps are small, but together they form the journey:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Introduce daily standups.</li>
				<li>Introduce work management such as stories and introduce Scrumban.</li>
				<li>Introduce planning, sprints, and retrospectives.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>During the initial workshop with Travelics, we held the team's first ever standup. The concept of the daily standup is aimed at answering three things:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What did I work on yesterday?</li>
				<li>What am I working on today?</li>
				<li>What issues are blocking me?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In sport, a huddle is strategic, keeping everyone informed and connected throughout the game. For technology teams, the standup is a huddle; it's designed to enforce the <em class="italic">we</em> and <em class="italic">one team</em> culture and mentality.</p>
			<p>Highlighting issues to the team often results in someone else in the team helping unblock them. Your standup should be no longer than 15 minutes. Don't go into the minute details of your day. Keep it at a high level and keep it relevant. Highlight issues, but don't discuss them in detail.</p>
			<p>The next day, someone from the CoE team attended the second daily standup this team ran. They only started the day before and it took around five minutes to complete. Everyone kept it simple, highlighting what they worked on and what they were working on. Blockers were discussed at a high level and agreement was taken to move the conversation offline. So, from a session the week before, in less than 30 minutes of meeting time, this team were already starting to get in sync with each other more than they were before.</p>
			<p>By now, we are already a little into this piece of work and one of the most important aspects of Agile is the introduction of retrospectives. Most teams, in fact, regardless of their Agile working status, already do some kind of retrospective, usually a team meeting. A retrospective or retro just focuses the mind on the last sprint. We ask different questions depending on the type of retro the Scrum master is running. You can get a number of different types of retros to run, such as 4 Ls, speedcar, starfish, and many others.</p>
			<p>The 4 Ls retrospective <a id="_idIndexMarker636"/>involves asking participants to add up cards under four headings: Liked, Learned, Lacked, and Longed For. This asks the team to discuss and highlight the positives and negatives.</p>
			<p>The speedcar retrospective, similar to the following example, is about highlighting the things that made the team move faster and things that slowed them down.</p>
			<p>The starfish retrospective, like the 4 Ls, asks the team to focus on what the team should do less or more, or start, stop, or keep doing. The principle is to foster thinking around the value the team gets from different practices in the team. The starfish retrospective is an important one when working in continuous feedback loops.</p>
			<p>For the first retrospective, the CoE team decided to run one of the most basic ones out there; this was the sailboat retro. In this, we draw a sailboat, add an anchor, and ask the team to place things that made the team go faster near the sail and things that dragged the team down near the anchor, as you can see in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer050" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.5 – Example drawing showing the concept of a sailboat retrospective</p>
			<p>This exercise is really <a id="_idIndexMarker637"/>simple and the feedback from the team was that they enjoyed the daily standups; they also enjoyed finding out more about what others in the team were up to and the Kanban style of working for visually highlighting where work is.</p>
			<p>Things that did not work for the team were the additional meeting time, as well as a feeling that sometimes the standups went on for too long and that the value was maybe not as high as they expected.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">While we are quite statistics-heavy in Agile, you can progress well and teach people the required skills and ways of working and see improvements without the need for a heavy focus on statistics. Improvements in metrics will come in time.</p>
			<p>It sounds crude, but propaganda is important when you are fundamentally changing how organizations work. Consider placing posters around the office environment and posting them out on communications channels. You can use the free posters from <em class="italic">Dandy People</em> (https://dandypeople.com/posters) as tools to aid in the messaging.</p>
			<h3>Reorganizing the team structure</h3>
			<p>Through our discussions with Travelics and our understanding of their goals, it's clear that their<a id="_idIndexMarker638"/> current team structure will not work. One of the fundamental changes is moving to a product-oriented view, away<a id="_idIndexMarker639"/> from a project view.</p>
			<p>The product view enables us to bring in product management roles to help manage and prioritize feedback as well as helping us to use market intelligence to drive the team's decision-making on what is a priority over something else:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer051" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.6 – Diagram of the Spotify model for scaling Agile</p>
			<p>Next is the desire to bring people closer together through collaboration and have the ability to scale these teams. One suitable approach to this challenge at Travelics could be the use of the <em class="italic">Spotify model</em> (https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/spotify). This introduces the use<a id="_idIndexMarker640"/> of terms such as <strong class="bold">squads</strong>, <strong class="bold">tribes</strong>, <strong class="bold">chapters</strong>, and <strong class="bold">guilds</strong>.</p>
			<h4>Squads</h4>
			<p>In layman's terms, a<a id="_idIndexMarker641"/> squad is a group of developers. In many ways, a squad is similar to a Scrum team in that it is intended to feel like a small start-up. These teams will typically sit together and have all of the necessary skills and tooling to design, develop, test, and release to production. Squads will decide how they want to work, which means that some will use Scrum sprints, others will use Kanban, and still others <a id="_idIndexMarker642"/>will use a combination known as Scrumban.</p>
			<p>Every squad has a specific goal, such as developing a specific feature of an application, managing the public website, writing the mobile application, or something else. Different squads could even be in charge of different aspects of the user experience.</p>
			<p>Squads are also encouraged to use principles such as <strong class="bold">minimum viable product</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVP</strong>), which means<a id="_idIndexMarker643"/> releasing early and frequently. I recall a quote from the first article I read about this topic by <em class="italic">Arthur von Kriegenbergh</em> (<a href="https://medium.com/agile-series/agile-series-how-we-work-think-it-build-it-ship-it-tweak-it-afrogleap-1afb080dedab">https://medium.com/agile-series/agile-series-how-we-work-think-it-build-it-ship-it-tweak-it-afrogleap-1afb080dedab</a>) that used the slogan <em class="italic">Think it, build it, ship it, tweak it</em>. Because each squad is laser-focused on one mission and one component of the product for such an extended period of time, they develop into key experts.</p>
			<h4>Tribes</h4>
			<p>Tribes are <a id="_idIndexMarker644"/>collections of squads, and these tribes are all squads that work on related parts of the product. For example, in the Spotify case, all of our squads could be in a tribe for the desktop application, desktop UI, or something else; you get the idea. Each tribe also has a tribe leader, who is responsible for ensuring that the tribe has everything the squads require. All squads within a tribe should ideally sit in the same physical location, if possible. Communal areas should also encourage levels of collaboration between squads.</p>
			<p>Have you ever heard of <em class="italic">Dunbar's Number</em>? Tribes should be sized according to this theory in an ideal world. According to this, most people are unable to maintain social relationships with more than about 100 people. When the group size exceeds this number, restrictive rules, politics, and additional layers of management add bureaucracy and other areas of inefficiencies. As a result, tribes should be designed to have fewer than 100 members.</p>
			<p>The loss of <a id="_idIndexMarker645"/>economies is one of the challenges associated with scalability and a high degree of autonomy. For example, a developer in one squad may be working on a problem that was solved by a developer in another squad the previous week. This is precisely what chapters and guilds are designed to address.</p>
			<h4>Chapters</h4>
			<p>Chapters, like guilds, serve <a id="_idIndexMarker646"/>as the glue that holds the company together. After all, with such high levels of autonomy and no communication between squads and tribes, your company might as well be divided into many small ones. Chapters and guilds allow you to benefit from economies of scale without giving up too much autonomy.</p>
			<p>For this reason, a chapter is a small group of people with similar skills who work in the same general area or within the same tribe. This means that developers, testers, security professionals, and any other role can really benefit from other people with similar skills who are also working in the same tribe; this glue means that within a chapter, you have deep expertise within your domain and can share skills and draw on others who understand the domain you are working in.</p>
			<h4>Guilds</h4>
			<p>Guilds are more akin to <a id="_idIndexMarker647"/>community organizations. A guild is a group of people who want to share their knowledge, tools, code, and practices. A guild is spread across the entire organization, whereas a chapter is local to a tribe. You can have as many guilds as you want in your organization; for example, consider the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Testing guild</li>
				<li>Cloud technology guild</li>
				<li>Scrum guild</li>
				<li>Agile coaching guild</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Doesn't this all sound like a matrix-style organization to you? It does, but not in the way you are accustomed to. People with similar skills are typically grouped together into functional teams and then assigned to projects, reporting to a manager of that team, who reports to a senior leader in that area. The matrix we've created and are working in here is geared toward delivery.</p>
			<p>Consider it in two<a id="_idIndexMarker648"/> dimensions: the horizontal dimension is for sharing knowledge, tools, and code, and the vertical dimension is for sharing code. The vertical dimension is the most important, and it is where people collaborate and organize to create great products. This describes how people are physically arranged and where they spend the majority of their time. Consider the vertical dimension to be <em class="italic">what</em> and the horizontal dimension to be <em class="italic">how</em>. The matrix structure ensures that each squad member receives guidance on both <em class="italic">what to build next</em> and <em class="italic">how to build it well</em>.</p>
			<h3>Implementing DevOps practices</h3>
			<p>Getting the right <a id="_idIndexMarker649"/>practices while being backed up by the right metrics is now the focus for Travelics. Using the things we have learned throughout this chapter, we can put in place metrics.</p>
			<p>So much about the metrics we discussed in <a href="B17192_03_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor071"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Measuring the Success of DevOps</em>, comes into focus here. Remember what we have learned about the goals of Travelics. In simple terms, they want to improve quality, increase velocity, and reduce the failure rate or increase stability.</p>
			<p>All of the metrics we discussed fall into those three categories. Here are some metrics that we can propose to help Travelics start to measure their performance going forward as they start to implement DevOps practices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Lead time – Travelics have a desire to improve their time to market. This metric helps them understand the amount of time it takes to take ideas from inception on the backlog to completion. Our target for this metric is 60 days; over time, this should be reduced as maturity increases.</li>
				<li>Deployment failure rate – Remember the complaints from customers about out-of-date software and new releases causing downtime? Well, this metric will help directly track that issue and in time, focused effort on pipelines, quality of code, and more incremental releases can help. Our target for this metric is 1%.</li>
				<li>Unit test coverage – Improving testing is a good way to improve quality, and introducing quality gates in releases around test coverage and test passes is key to increasing quality. Our target for this metric is 95%.</li>
				<li>Defect aging – Travelics also have a problem with high amounts of technical debt. Putting a<a id="_idIndexMarker650"/> metric around the age of defects is really key to getting that number down, as well as introducing technical sprints to address that technical debt. Our target for this metrics is 7 days.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Mean time to recovery</strong> (<strong class="bold">MTTR</strong>) – To address the issue with outages, measuring the MTTR will place <a id="_idIndexMarker651"/>specific emphasis on the recovery time and improving that. It helps also drive levels of automated recovery within the teams and helps focus on missing elements that contribute to further downtime.</li>
				<li>Incidents per deployment – The last metric that will help Travelics is one that looks at the number of support incidents generated per deployment. This helps to track the satisfaction of customers in line with the release strategy as well as helping to determine further improvements that can be made.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is also the phase at which you introduce tooling to help determine the direction of travel for process automation. When you have a baseline of metrics, introducing tooling helps you further identify areas where you can improve.</p>
			<h3>Getting on the feedback loop</h3>
			<p>Finally, at this <a id="_idIndexMarker652"/>point, your established continuous improvement and feedback loops should kick into gear more rigorously and work to evolve what the transformation team have created, putting the organization on the way to wider success.</p>
			<p>During a transformation process, you learn a large amount about the organization, the processes it uses, and the people within it. All of these learnings are critical to feedback on the continued investment in DevOps and the continued success of Travelics.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-265"><a id="_idTextAnchor264"/>Scaling out the DevOps transformation</h2>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker653"/> penultimate step is to take feedback from pilot metrics and scale them by running multiple release trains from various application portfolios. It is insufficient to simply perform daily builds and automated deployments. Continuous feedback and optimization are the final pieces of the DevOps puzzle.</p>
			<p>Notice that I mentioned that this is the penultimate step. Actually, you should never finish; just because you have negotiated transformation does not mean you are finished. This is an opportunity to take what you have learned from your pilot groups and give feedback to sponsors, product owners, and stakeholders.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-266"><a id="_idTextAnchor265"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we have provided a summary of the key learning from the book and have looked at specific implementation guidance for a fictional travel company. This advice has helped drive Travelics in the right direction and they are now, after a period of 18 months, hitting consistent metric targets and looking to further improve what the CoE has developed within the organization.</p>
			<p>As the chapter and indeed the book draws to a close, I would like to thank you for coming on the DevOps transformation journey with me. I hope that you have found the book informative and can take things we have learned together into your organizations to drive change. </p>
