    tick; things such as a boost in productivity, better-quality products, and improved
    employee retention were three of these reasons. Also, there are things that directly
    contribute to the success of the business, such as improved growth, customer satisfaction,
    and customer experience.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You could list numerous technical benefits associated with DevOps. However,
    when you are working toward DevOps transformation, it is important to not focus
    on the minute details too much and to try and keep your eye on the broader benefits.
    The reason for this is that often those smaller benefits, while beneficial to
    you or your team, may not be broader benefits for other teams, the department,
    or your organization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keeping that organizational view will ensure you get maximum buy-in. Teams across
    the organization will feel similar benefits specific to their team, and that is
    great, but you must focus on the bigger benefits.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Three benefits stand out for me as critical and align with the preceding scenario
    of thinking about the bigger picture. They are continuous software delivery, faster
    resolution of problems, and less complexity. This also presents the opportunity
    to provide more proactive and reactive management of technical debt.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Continuous integration and continuous deployment and delivery are cornerstones
    of DevOps and are clear technical benefits. When implemented correctly, not only
    do they provide you clear benefits around the building and deployment of your
    applications but they provide a means to catch bad practices during development,
    as well as catching security issues and threats along the way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the practices employed in DevOps, you are making your environment less
    complex. This reduction in complexity is attractive to organizations as well as
    individual teams. The best thing is that the reduction in complexity can be in
    a number of areas, such as your workflows, meaning you've automated manual tasks;
    it could be in the production of documentation, for example. It also means removing
    unnecessary steps from your processes. This comes in the form of value stream
    mapping exercises to identify and remove them from your operation.

    that comes with DevOps also comes site reliability engineering, which is to do
    with the ability to recover from failures quickly. **Site reliability engineering**

    and operations problems.

    in DevOps. Culture in DevOps is what binds our teams together. Happier, more productive
    teams; greater professional development opportunities; and higher employee engagement
    are three of the big cultural benefits you can achieve from a successful implementation
    of DevOps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I just talked about the shared responsibilities in teams that come with DevOps.
    This is a big driver for cultural benefits. When teams are invested in shared
    responsibilities, common goals, and driving vision, this creates a culturally
    sound working environment that drives happier teams that are more productive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One further benefit to this is the higher employee engagement from the good
    culture that DevOps can breed. We are taught in DevOps the notions "fail fast"
    and "growth mindset." Both of these mean employees are more likely to voice their
    ideas and be open with each other because the focus is not on blame; the focus
    is on making things better and sharing ideas to achieve the common goal.

    your team quite naturally. You provide people with the tools and the capabilities
    to expand their knowledge and further their careers. Organizations with true career
    growth opportunities are one of the biggest things new hires will look for. DevOps
    can help your organization be attractive for new hires.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a non-DevOps environment, there is often a conflict between releasing new
    features and maintaining stability. The development team is evaluated based on
    the number of updates delivered to users, whereas the operations team is evaluated
    based on the overall health of the system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a DevOps environment, everyone on the team is responsible for delivering
    new features as well as stability. Because code isn't *thrown over the wall* to
    operations at the end of development, the combination of a shared code base, continuous
    integration, test-driven techniques, and automated deployments, among other things,
    exposes issues in application code, infrastructure, or configuration earlier in
    the process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because change sets are smaller, problems tend to be less complex. DevOps engineers
    can use real-time data on system performance to quickly understand the impact
    of application changes. And resolution times are reduced because team members
    do not have to wait for a different team to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

    people and other machines—or they are stuck solving the same problems over and
    over. Employees prefer to be productive, and time spent churning causes frustration
    and unhappiness. Everyone benefits when people can spend less time on unsatisfying
    aspects of their jobs and more time on adding value to the organization.
  prefs: []

    standardized production environments, which make deployments predictable and free
    people from routine repetitive tasks to do more high-value things. For example,
    a large financial services firm with over 4,000 IT employees saved over $8 million
    by implementing DevOps, which reduced MTTR and eliminated legacy tool maintenance.

    to the software engineering teams. The process of doing this is via engagement
    with account managers as well as industry experience from engineers on the team.
    All requests are centrally managed and distributed to teams responsible for that
    feature. The work is undertaken and queued for release.

    They rely on documentation from the development team to troubleshoot the application.
    The application is currently undergoing a transformation from being a monolithic
    application that is deployed on virtual machines in a public cloud environment
    to being one that is more cloud-native and relies on microservices and multi-tenanted

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The current ways of working provide a number of challenges for Travelics. The
    biggest is that they are not agile enough in how they deliver their applications.
    Releases only happen twice a year; this often results in failures at deployment
    and rollback of the application while the issues are resolved. This outage can
    often be around four hours.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is a general lack of review and oversight of each other''s work. This leads to
    bugs, and the engineering teams have a large list of technical debt that needs
    addressing.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The lack of scalability and cloud-native approach is also limiting. This provides
    serious operational challenges and results in different configuration approaches
    for different customers; versions of the application are not consistent across
    all customers and some customers also have unsupported versions deployed as they
    are unwilling to allow the company to upgrade them over the fear of outages.

    important aspects of Agile is the introduction of retrospectives. Most teams,

    usually a team meeting. A retrospective or retro just focuses the mind on the
    last sprint. We ask different questions depending on the type of retro the Scrum
    master is running. You can get a number of different types of retros to run, such
    as 4 Ls, speedcar, starfish, and many others.

    at Travelics could be the use of the *Spotify model* (https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/spotify).

    and **guilds**.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In layman's terms, a squad is a group of developers. In many ways, a squad is
    similar to a Scrum team in that it is intended to feel like a small start-up.
    These teams will typically sit together and have all of the necessary skills and
    tooling to design, develop, test, and release to production. Squads will decide
    how they want to work, which means that some will use Scrum sprints, others will
    use Kanban, and still others will use a combination known as Scrumban.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    application, managing the public website, writing the mobile application, or something
    else. Different squads could even be in charge of different aspects of the user
    experience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    (**MVP**), which means releasing early and frequently. I recall a quote from the
    first article I read about this topic by *Arthur von Kriegenbergh* ([https://medium.com/agile-series/agile-series-how-we-work-think-it-build-it-ship-it-tweak-it-afrogleap-1afb080dedab](https://medium.com/agile-series/agile-series-how-we-work-think-it-build-it-ship-it-tweak-it-afrogleap-1afb080dedab))
    that used the slogan *Think it, build it, ship it, tweak it*. Because each squad
    is laser-focused on one mission and one component of the product for such an extended
    period of time, they develop into key experts.

    on related parts of the product. For example, in the Spotify case, all of our
    squads could be in a tribe for the desktop application, desktop UI, or something
    else; you get the idea. Each tribe also has a tribe leader, who is responsible
    for ensuring that the tribe has everything the squads require. All squads within
    a tribe should ideally sit in the same physical location, if possible. Communal
    areas should also encourage levels of collaboration between squads.

- en: Have you ever heard of *Dunbar's Number*? Tribes should be sized according to
    this theory in an ideal world. According to this, most people are unable to maintain
    social relationships with more than about 100 people. When the group size exceeds
    this number, restrictive rules, politics, and additional layers of management
    add bureaucracy and other areas of inefficiencies. As a result, tribes should
    be designed to have fewer than 100 members.
