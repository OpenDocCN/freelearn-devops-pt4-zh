			<p><em class="italics">DevOps Culture and Practice with OpenShift</em> features many different real-world practices - some people-related, some process-related, some technology-related - to facilitate successful DevOps, and in turn OpenShift, adoption within your organization. It introduces many DevOps concepts and tools to connect culture and practice through a continuous loop of discovery, pivots, and delivery underpinned by a foundation of collaboration and software engineering.</p>
			<p>Containers and container-centric application lifecycle management are now an industry standard, and OpenShift has a leading position in a flourishing market of enterprise Kubernetes-based product offerings. <em class="italics">DevOps Culture and Practice with OpenShift</em> provides a roadmap for building empowered product teams within your organization. </p>
			<p>This guide brings together lean, agile, design thinking, DevOps, culture, facilitation, and hands-on technical enablement all in one book. Through a combination of real-world stories, a practical case study, facilitation guides, and technical implementation details, <em class="italics">DevOps Culture and Practice with OpenShift</em> provides tools and techniques to build a DevOps culture within your organization on Red Hat’s OpenShift Container Platform.</p>

			<p><strong class="bold">Tim Beattie</strong> is Global Head of Product and a Senior Principal Engagement Lead for Red Hat Open Innovation Labs. His career in product delivery spans 20 years as an agile and lean transformation coach - a continuous delivery &amp; design thinking advocate who brings people together to build meaningful products and services whilst transitioning larger corporations towards business agility. He lives in Winchester, UK, with his wife and dog, Gerrard the Labrador (the other Lab in his life) having adapted from being a cat-person to a dog-person in his 30s. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Mike Hepburn</strong> is Global Principal Architect for Red Hat Open Innovation Labs and helps customers transform their ways of working. He spends most of his working day helping customers and teams transform the way they deliver applications to production with OpenShift. He co-authored the book "DevOps with OpenShift" and loves the outdoors, family, friends, good coffee, and good beer. Mike loves most animals, not the big hairy spiders (Huntsman) found in Australia, and is generally a cat person unless it's Tuesday, when he is a dog person.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Noel O'Connor</strong> is a Senior Principal Architect in Red Hat's EMEA Solutions Practice specializing in cloud native application and integration architectures. He has worked with many of Red Hat's global enterprise customers in both Europe, Middle East &amp; Asia. He co-authored the book "DevOps with OpenShift" and he constantly tries to learn new things to varying degrees of success. Noel prefers dogs over cats but got overruled by the rest of the team.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Donal Spring</strong> is a Senior Architect for Red Hat Open Innovation Labs. He works in the delivery teams with his sleeves rolled up tackling anything that's needed - from coaching and mentoring the team members, setting the technical direction, to coding and writing tests. He loves technology and getting his hands dirty exploring new tech, frameworks, and patterns. He can often be found on weekends coding away on personal projects and automating all the things. Cats or Dogs? He likes both :)</p>

			<p><strong class="bold">Ilaria Doria</strong> is an Engagement Lead and Principal at Red Hat Open Innovation Labs. In 2013, she entered into the Agile arena becoming a coach and enabling large customers in their digital transformation journey. Her background is in end-user experience and consultancy using open practices to lead complex transformation and scaling agile in large organizations. Colorful sticky notes and doodles have always been a part of her life, and this is why she provided all illustrations in the book and built all digital templates. She is definitely a dog person.</p>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>Approach</h3>
			<p>This book blends to-the-point theoretical explanations with real-world examples to enable you to develop your skills as a DevOps practitioner or advocate.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-12"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"/>Hardware and software requirements</h3>
			<p>There are five chapters that dive deeper into technology. <em class="italics">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italics">Open Technical Practices - Beginnings, Starting Right</em> and <em class="italics">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italics">Open Technical Practices -</em> <em class="italics">The Midpoint</em> focuses on boot-strapping the technical environment. <em class="italics">Chapter 14</em>, <em class="italics">Build It</em>, <em class="italics">Chapter 15</em>, <em class="italics">Run It,</em> and <em class="italics">Chapter 16</em>, <em class="italics">Own It</em> cover the development and operations of features into our application running on the OpenShift platform. </p>
			<p>We recommend all readers, regardless of their technical skill, explore the concepts explained in these chapters. Optionally, you may wish to try some of the technical practices yourself. These chapters provide guidance in how to do that. </p>
			<p>The OpenShift Sizing requirements for running these exercises are outlined in Appendix A.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-13"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"/>Conventions</h3>
			<p>Code words in the text, database names, folder names, filenames, and file extensions are shown as follows:</p>
			<p>We are going to cover the basics of component testing the PetBattle user interface using Jest. The user interface is made of several components. The first one you see when landing on the application is the home page. For the home page component, the test class is called <strong class="inline">home.component.spec.ts</strong>:</p>
			<p class="snippet">describe('HomeComponent', () =&gt; {</p>
			<p class="snippet">  let component: HomeComponent;</p>
			<p class="snippet">  let fixture: ComponentFixture&lt;HomeComponent&gt;;</p>
			<p class="snippet">  beforeEach(async () =&gt; {...</p>
			<p class="snippet">  });</p>
			<p class="snippet">  beforeEach(() =&gt; {...</p>
			<p class="snippet">  });</p>
			<p class="snippet">  it('should create', () =&gt; {</p>
			<p class="snippet">    expect(component).toBeTruthy();</p>
			<p class="snippet">  });</p>
			<p class="snippet">});</p>
