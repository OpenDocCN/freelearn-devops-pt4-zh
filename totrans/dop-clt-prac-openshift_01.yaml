- en: '| ![](img/Tim.jpg) | **Tim** - Thank you so much to my wife, Charley, for being
    such an immense support and encouragement in helping me write this book and in
    everything I do. I also want to express my thanks to my extended family including
    my Mum, Chantelle, Bev, Ivy, Henry, Kieran, and Sharon as well as all my friends
    and colleagues, past and present, who have all helped develop me and my career.
    Finally, I dedicate this to my late Dad who I know would be very proud of this
    and who I miss every day. |'

    和 Sharon，以及我所有的朋友和同事，无论是过去还是现在，他们都帮助了我个人和职业的成长。最后，我把这本书献给我的已故父亲，我知道他会为此感到非常骄傲，我每天都很想念他。'
- en: '| ![](img/Mike.jpg) | **Mike** - We wrote this book during COVID-19 times.
    You would think that might make it easier, being locked away, gaining weight.
    In fact, for everyone globally, it has been a time of turmoil and stress, so I
    want to thank everyone involved for sticking with it, especially my immediate
    family who have supported me all the way. I am going to repeat my favorite quote
    from Harry S. Truman - "*It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care
    who gets the credit*". To the amazing community that has provided the ideas that
    have gone into this book, thank you. |'

  zh: '| ![](img/Mike.jpg) | **Mike** - 我们在 COVID-19 疫情期间写了这本书。你可能会认为，关在家里、体重增加，反而让写书变得更容易。事实上，对于全球每个人来说，这段时间充满了动荡和压力，所以我要感谢所有参与其中的人，特别是我的直系家人，他们一直支持我。我想重复我最喜欢的哈里·S·杜鲁门的名言——"*如果你不在乎谁获得了功劳，你会惊讶于自己能
    accomplish 的成就*"。感谢为这本书提供创意的那个了不起的社区。'

    your support and patience. We''re still not getting a cat though :-) Also thanks

- en: '| ![](img/Donal.jpg) | **Donal** - I have to start by saying thank you to my
    awesome wife, Natasha Carroll. When we started writing this book, it was just
    the two of us and now we have a small boy Cillian and Louis the pup. Finding time
    to carve out to finish the book could only be done with her rallying and support.
    Thanks to my Mum and Dad for encouraging me to get into IT and leading me down
    the path I''m on. The experiences shared in this book come from all the amazing
    teams I''ve been in over the years. They''ve shaped my opinions and the learnings
    shared here, so thank you all. |'

  zh: '| ![](img/Donal.jpg) | **Donal** - 首先要感谢我的妻子，娜塔莎·卡罗尔。当我们开始写这本书时，只有我们两个人，现在我们有了一个小男孩Cillian和一只小狗Louis。能够找到时间完成这本书，只有在她的支持和鼓励下才得以实现。感谢我的父母，是他们鼓励我进入IT行业，并引导我走上了这条道路。本书中的经验来自于多年来我所在的所有精彩团队。他们塑造了我的观点和在这里分享的学习经历，感谢你们所有人。

- en: '| ![](img/Ilaria.jpg) | **Ilaria** - First thanks to Noel and Tim. When I heard
    they started a book, I asked if I could help. I was going through a hard time,
    and they said, "*yes, why not? Why don''t you do the illustrations?*" I was not
    conscious of what that meant and realized only after a few months the effort and
    how many new things I had to learn and practice! I have also to thank Furo, my
    husband, and my parents who always encouraged me in trusting I could do it, and
    I did it ;) |'
