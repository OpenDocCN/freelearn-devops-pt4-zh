    such an immense support and encouragement in helping me write this book and in
    everything I do. I also want to express my thanks to my extended family including
    my Mum, Chantelle, Bev, Ivy, Henry, Kieran, and Sharon as well as all my friends
    and colleagues, past and present, who have all helped develop me and my career.
    Finally, IÂ dedicate this to my late Dad who I know would be very proud of this
    and who I miss every day. |'

    You would think that might make it easier, being locked away, gaining weight.
    In fact, for everyone globally, it has been a time of turmoil and stress, so I
    want to thank everyone involved for sticking with it, especially my immediate
    family who have supported me all the way. I am going to repeat my favorite quote
    from Harry S. Truman - "*It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care
    who gets the credit*". To the amazing community that has provided the ideas that
    have gone into this book, thank you. |'

    awesome wife, Natasha Carroll. When we started writing this book, it was just
    the two of us and now we have a small boy Cillian and Louis the pup. Finding time
    to carve out to finish the book could only be done with her rallying and support.
    Thanks to my Mum and Dad for encouraging me to get into IT and leading me down
    the path I''m on. The experiences shared in this book come from all the amazing
    teams I''ve been in over the years. They''ve shaped my opinions and the learnings
    shared here, so thank you all. |'

- en: '| ![](img/Ilaria.jpg) | **Ilaria** - First thanks to Noel and Tim. When I heard
    they started a book, I asked if I could help. I was going through a hard time,
    and they said, "*yes, why not? Why don''t you do the illustrations?*" I was not
    conscious of what that meant and realized only after a few months the effort and
    how many new things I had to learn and practice! I have also to thank Furo, my
    husband, and my parents who always encouraged me in trusting I could do it, and
    I did it ;) |'
