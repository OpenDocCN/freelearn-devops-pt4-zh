			<p>In this section, we are going to introduce the book, where it came from, and how it's organized.</p>
			<p><em class="italics">Chapter 1, Introduction â€“ Start with Why</em> focuses on the book's purpose and the target audience. <em class="italics">Chapter 2, Introducing DevOps and Some Tools</em> explains, in our words, what DevOps is and how it helps speed up the value chain of product development. We'll explore what this chain is and the bottlenecks that DevOps culture and practices address. We'll introduce a couple of important tools that we'll use throughout the book to navigate around the use of many different types of practices we're going to apply. In <em class="italics">Chapter 3, The Journey Ahead</em>, we will introduce how we use real-world stories and the case study we'll use throughout the book that will outline how the remaining six sections of the book are organized.</p>
			<p>This will set us up to build a foundation and start a journey of continuous discovery, options, and continuous delivery.</p>
