    the target audience. *Chapter 2, Introducing DevOps and Some Tools* explains,
    in our words, what DevOps is and how it helps speed up the value chain of product
    development. We''ll explore what this chain is and the bottlenecks that DevOps
    culture and practices address. We''ll introduce a couple of important tools that
    we''ll use throughout the book to navigate around the use of many different types
    of practices we''re going to apply. In *Chapter 3, The Journey Ahead*, we will
    introduce how we use real-world stories and the case study we''ll use throughout
    the book that will outline how the remaining six sections of the book are organized.'
