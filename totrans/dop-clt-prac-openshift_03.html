			<p>You've picked up this book and have started reading it — thank you very much!</p>&#13;
			<p>Perhaps you read the back cover and it gave you just enough information to be inquisitive enough to open the book up and read some more. Maybe a friend or colleague told you about it and recommended it to you. Maybe you have stumbled upon it for another reason. Whatever the reason, we're very happy you've taken some time out of your day to start reading this and we hope you get some value from it and want to keep reading it.</p>&#13;
			<p>Before going into any kind of detail regarding what this book is about and what it's going to cover, we want to <a id="_idIndexMarker000"/><a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>start with why. This is a practice we use to create a common vision of purpose. Why have we written this book? What problems is it trying to solve and who is the intended audience?</p>&#13;

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Why — For What Reason or Purpose? </h2>&#13;
			<p>While this book may have been positioned as a book about technology, it is, at most, only one-third about technology. DevOps is really all about collaboration. We wrote this book because we want to increase your understanding of DevOps, collaboration, and cultural and engineering practices on a container platform such as OpenShift. We want to make moving to DevOps easier and provide a clearer path for you to apply DevOps using OpenShift. We want to excite you when reading this and give you some inspiration as to how you can apply DevOps principles and practices. We want to equip you to go out and try these new techniques and practices.</p>&#13;
			<p>As you progress through this book, we want you to continually measure the usefulness (impact/value) of using these new techniques. In fact, every time you try something out, we want you to think about and measure what impact it had.</p>&#13;
			<p>That impact might be at an individual level: <em class="italics">What impact did trying that thing out have on me or a customer or a user?</em> <em class="italics">For example, has it reduced my cycle time to complete a set of delivery activities?</em> Alternatively, it might be an impact on a team or a department you work in: <em class="italics">Has team satisfaction been increased?</em> <em class="italics">What did we, as a group of people, achieve from that?</em> The impact might even be felt at organizational or societal level: <em class="italics">Has it reduced the number of operational incidents impacting customers?</em> We believe you will quickly start to see positive effects in all of these aspects. As a result, maybe you'll leave us nice reviews and tell all your friends about this book. If not, perhaps you can pivot and use this book as a doorstop or a monitor stand, which, of course, will give you a different type of value!</p>&#13;
			<p>If you don't know where to start with how to go about measuring value, read on — we promise we'll cover that.</p>&#13;
			<p>What we've just done is started using one of the practices and techniques used in writing this book. We have used the<a id="_idIndexMarker002"/><a id="_idIndexMarker003"/> <strong class="bold">Start with why</strong> practice, which is something we always strive to do with every team or organization we work with.</p>&#13;
			<p>So, what is a practice? A practice is an activity that helps teams achieve specific goals. It's not just an idea; it's <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/><a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>something that you do repeatedly in order to hone or polish a skill. Practices have the following attributes:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Empowering</strong>: The practices<a id="_idIndexMarker006"/><a id="_idIndexMarker007"/> in this book will help teams discover and deliver iteratively.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Concise</strong>: They can be read in a few minutes.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Agnostic</strong>: Practices don't require the team to follow a specific framework.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Proven</strong>: Practices have been tested in the real world.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Repeatable</strong>: Practices can be used more than once.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Hopefully, throughout this book, you'll see examples of us <strong class="bold">practicing what we preach</strong> through the experiences, stories, and tips we will share from our real-world delivery experience, which includes stories such as these:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>The story about when we worked with an insurance company to rebuild one of their applications using DevOps and OpenShift but had a <strong class="bold">stop the world</strong> moment (a practice we'll talk about in the next section) when we realized we were redeveloping an app that users did not want and were not using!</li>&#13;
				<li>The story of when we worked with a European automotive company and kick-started modern application development and agile practices with one of their teams, only for the product owner to question how they were going to prove to management that this was a better way of working when management <strong class="bold">only work with spreadsheets and numbers</strong>.</li>&#13;
				<li>The story of the telecom company that suffered huge outages and non-functional problems over a festive period and were keen to learn new cultural and engineering practices to drive an auto-scaling and self-healing approach to their infrastructure and applications.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Why Should I Listen to These Folks?</h2>&#13;
			<p>Before you read any more from the four folks writing this book, perhaps it's worth taking a step back and sharing a bit of background as to where all our anecdotes, theories, stories, and tips come from.</p>&#13;
			<p>We all work for Red Hat. In particular, we are all a part of Red Hat's services organization, which means that we all regularly interact with, and deliver professional services to, Red Hat customers. This ranges from helping with installation and supporting the early adoption of Red Hat technology to driving large transformation programs underpinned by Red Hat technology and Red Hat's culture.</p>&#13;
			<p>Red Hat's culture is relatively unique as it is entirely based on open source culture and open organizations (of which Red Hat is <a id="_idIndexMarker008"/><a id="_idIndexMarker009"/>one of the largest examples). This means that the Red Hat organization is run under a set of characteristics that are closely aligned with open source culture and philosophy. They include collaboration, community, inclusivity, adaptability, and transparency. We highly recommend learning more about Red Hat's open organization philosophy by reading <em class="italics">Jim Whitehurst's The Open Organization</em><span id="footnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-002">1</a></span>.</p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<p>A lot of the experience that has informed this book and the stories and tips we will share emanate from engagements led by Red Hat Open Innovation Labs (or Labs for short). Labs provides an immersive and open approach to creating new ways of working that can help our customers and their teams develop digital solutions and accelerate business value using open technology and <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/><a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>open culture. The main offering provided by Labs is called the residency, which is a four- to twelve-week timeboxed engagement where client's engineers are matched one-on-one with Red Hat's technology and culture specialists.</p>&#13;
			<p>Between the four authors, we've been involved in over 50 Open Innovation Labs' residencies around the world, in addition to many other professional services engagements. Due to the relatively short nature of Labs residencies, we get to learn very quickly different techniques, different approaches, and different practices. We get to see what works well and what doesn't work so well. We get to build up a huge collection of stories and tips. This book is all about sharing those stories and tips.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Where Did This Book Come From? </h2>&#13;
			<p>The title of this book is an evolution of a training enablement program that the authors have developed named <em class="italics">DevOps Culture and Practice Enablement</em>. This is an immersive training course run by Red Hat, providing enablement to Red Hat customers, partners, and employees.</p>&#13;
			<p>We initially created the course because the services area of Red Hat we are working in was growing, and we needed a way to consistently increase the enthusiasm and shared understanding behind the practices and culture we were using globally, with our customers, and within our own organization. We wanted to do this by exploring all of the principal practices we had found to be successful in taking many products to market with our customers. This included practices to help understand the why and drive the discovery of products, as well as practices that would help us safely, securely, and confidently deliver in an iterative and incremental manner. And then there was the third outcome, which was having fun. We really couldn't see the point in all of this if you couldn't have some fun, banter, and enjoyment as you went along — it's one of the key ingredients of that mysterious word culture.</p>&#13;
			<div id="footnote-002" class="_idFootnote" epub:type="footnote">&#13;
				<p class="FootNote"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-002-backlink">1</a>	https://www.redhat.com/en/explore/the-open-organization-book</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			&#13;
			<p>One of the key success factors behind this was injecting lots of experience and real-life stories into our delivery and using a lot of our practices on ourselves to deliver the course. Every time we run the course, we use the definition of done<span id="footnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-001">2</a></span> practice to explain to participants that every practice we are going to teach on the course will be presented in a consistent way, following this process:</p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li>Introducing the practice with the theory and an overview of what it is, why you should use it, and how to use it</li>&#13;
				<li>A hands-on practical exercise so everyone participating can leave the course having <strong class="bold">had a go</strong> at using the practice and having gained some learning and experience from it</li>&#13;
				<li>A real-world example of the practice being used in action on a real customer delivery project or product development initiative</li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>The core practices taught in this course vary from discovery practices, such as impact mapping and event storming, to delivery practices, such as sprint planning and retrospectives. They include a set of practices we've found to be very powerful in establishing high-performing, long-lived product teams, such <a id="_idIndexMarker012"/><a id="_idIndexMarker013"/>as social contracts, team sentiment practices, and mob and pair programming. They include the engineering practices that many coming to the course would have most strongly associated with the term <em class="italics">DevOps</em>, such as<a id="_idIndexMarker014"/><a id="_idIndexMarker015"/> continuous integration, continuous delivery, test-driven development, and infrastructure as code.</p>&#13;
			<p>One of the unique aspects of this course is its appeal to a broad audience. It is not exclusively for technologists or designers. In fact, we embraced the idea of having cross-functional groups of people spanning from engineers to project managers, from infrastructure experts <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/><a id="_idIndexMarker017"/>to user experience designers. We felt this course offered the opportunity to break down silos. We intentionally do not run different tracks for different types of people. The aim is for participants to have a shared understanding of all of the practices that can be applied to truly appreciate and enable a DevOps culture.</p>&#13;
			<p>Having run this course more than a hundred times globally, we've learned volumes from it and have continuously improved it as we've gone along.</p>&#13;
			<p>Faced with the opportunity to write a new book about DevOps with OpenShift and to apply new learnings and more up-to-date technologies from <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/><a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>Stefano Picozzi, Mike Hepburn, and Noel O'Connor's existing book, <em class="italics">DevOps with OpenShift – Cloud Deployments Made Easy</em>, we considered what the important ingredients are to make DevOps with OpenShift a success for any organization choosing to adopt the technology.</p>&#13;
			<div id="footnote-001" class="_idFootnote" epub:type="footnote">&#13;
				<p class="FootNote"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-001-backlink">2</a>	https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/definition-of-done/</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>The success factors are all based on people, processes, and technology through the application of the many practices we've used with our customers globally and, in particular, the kinds of practices we were introducing and enabling using DevOps culture and practice enablement.</p>&#13;
			<p>This book's purpose is to enable you to understand and be ready to apply the many different practices — some people-related, some process-related, some technology-related — that will make DevOps culture and practice with OpenShift a success within your organization.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Who Exactly Is This Book For?</h2>&#13;
			<p>This book is intended for a broad audience — anyone who is in any way interested in DevOps practices and/or OpenShift or other Kubernetes platforms. One of the first activities for us to undertake was to get together and list the different personas and types of reader we intended to write for. These included the following: </p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 1.2: The intended audience </p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Caoimhe</strong>, a technical lead who looks after a team of people who develop software. She wants to learn more about DevOps so she can help adopt great DevOps practices.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Fionn</strong>, a project manager who is responsible for a set of legacy software applications and wants to modernize his team's approach to make use of this <strong class="bold">DevOps</strong> thing he's heard lots of people talking about.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Padraig</strong>, an Agile coach <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/><a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>who is very experienced in applying Agile delivery frameworks such as <strong class="bold">Scrum</strong> and wants to further his skills and experience with DevOps. He feels that this will really add value to the teams he is coaching.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Tadhg</strong>, a user experience designer who wants <a id="_idIndexMarker022"/><a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>to better understand what other people in the company's development team do with his designs and how he can collaborate with them to deliver products.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Séamus</strong>, who is an IT leader executing <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/><a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>his company's technology strategy to adopt containers <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/><a id="_idIndexMarker027"/>and cloud-native technology across the company's entire IT estate. He has chosen <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/><strong class="bold">OpenShift Container Platform</strong> (<strong class="bold">OCP</strong>) as the strategic product to support this. He wants to ensure that OCP generates a fast return on investment and that there is a large uptake across all IT teams in his organization.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Aroha</strong>, the CIO of the <a id="_idIndexMarker029"/><a id="_idIndexMarker030"/>organization. She wants to ensure that the company's people are aligned with company strategy and getting the very best out of the technology and the organizational decisions being made to drive the strategy. She's motivated for the business to become more agile and adapt quickly if and when market conditions change. She wants to read about what similarly sized organizations in different industries (including in her own industry) have successfully done and what they saw as being the critical success factors.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Siobhán</strong>, an infrastructure engineer who has<a id="_idIndexMarker031"/><a id="_idIndexMarker032"/> been using Kubernetes for many years and is now part of a team introducing OCP to her organization. She wants to ensure that the platform is configured to support her team's goals and wants to know how she can best work with development teams so that they get the maximum value out of the technology.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Eimar</strong>, a project manager who has spent two decades delivering IT projects through up-front planning, tracking deliverables against plans, and managing risks, issues, and dependencies with strong project reporting and stakeholder management skills. She gets frustrated by the amount of time it takes to ship software and not being able to address user needs and fixes quickly. She sees the benefit of moving to a more product-centric approach rather than a project-centric one. She would like to re-skill herself to be a product manager. In doing this, she wants to be able to test and adapt quickly, ship deliverables quicker, adapt to changing market conditions, and <a id="_idIndexMarker033"/><a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>also improve performance, uptime, recovery times, and more.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Finn</strong>, a system tester who takes great pride in quality assuring software before it is shipped to customers. His business analysis background helps him develop comprehensive testing approaches and scripts and, over the years, he's also led performance testing, security testing, and operability testing. He's keen to learn how he can introduce more automation to his work and branch out to other forms of testing.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>From I to T to M</h3>&#13;
			<p>With this book, we want people to move away from being <strong class="bold">I-shaped</strong>, where they are a specialist in one skill or one field. We want them to become more <strong class="bold">T-shaped</strong>, where they still have a depth of skill and experience in a particular field (such as infrastructure or UX design), but they <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/><a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>also have an appreciation and breadth of knowledge across all the other skills that people bring to make up a cross-functional team. This could be a frontend engineer, for example, who also works side by side with the API engineer.</p>&#13;
			<p>A great cross-functional team is one where the full team holds all the skills and experience they need. They are empowered to take a new requirement from a user or business stakeholder through to production. A team could be made up of lots of <strong class="bold">I-shaped</strong> people, but this <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/><a id="_idIndexMarker038"/>type of team quickly becomes dependent on specific individuals who can be a blocker when they are not available. For example, if a database change is needed to expose a new API but only one team member has the knowledge to be able to do this, the team can quickly become stuck. If the team is full of more <strong class="bold">T-shaped</strong> members, there is<a id="_idIndexMarker039"/><a id="_idIndexMarker040"/> a greater opportunity for collaboration, sharing, and partnerships across the team and less reliance on individuals:</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 1.3: Skills transformation</p>&#13;
			<p>We want this book to help <strong class="bold">I-shaped</strong> people become more <strong class="bold">T-shaped</strong> and perhaps even become <strong class="bold">M-shaped</strong>. <strong class="bold">M-shaped</strong> people are<a id="_idIndexMarker041"/><a id="_idIndexMarker042"/> inspired to deepen their learning, take it into other fields, and hold multiple skills, thereby building stronger cross-functional teams.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Conclusion </h2>&#13;
			<p>This chapter presented a brief overview of why we wrote this book and who it is intended for. </p>&#13;
			<p>We introduced ourselves and how we will be using our applied knowledge, experience, and learnings to write this book full of stories and examples.</p>&#13;
			<p>We examined the different personas we are targeting in this book and how we intend to help move these focused I-shaped people into more T-shaped or M-shaped to build stronger cross functional teams.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the next chapter, we will introduce DevOps and some tools we will use during the book to organize and explain DevOps practices.</p>&#13;
