- en: While this book may have been positioned as a book about technology, it is,
    at most, only one-third about technology. DevOps is really all about collaboration.
    We wrote this book because we want to increase your understanding of DevOps, collaboration,
    and cultural and engineering practices on a container platform such as OpenShift.
    We want to make moving to DevOps easier and provide a clearer path for you to
    apply DevOps using OpenShift. We want to excite you when reading this and give
    you some inspiration as to how you can apply DevOps principles and practices.
    We want to equip you to go out and try these new techniques and practices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you progress through this book, we want you to continually measure the usefulness
    (impact/value) of using these new techniques. In fact, every time you try something
    out, we want you to think about and measure what impact it had.

    out have on me or a customer or a user?* *For example, has it reduced my cycle
    time to complete a set of delivery activities?* Alternatively, it might be an
    impact on a team or a department you work in: *Has team satisfaction been increased?*
    *What did we, as a group of people, achieve from that?* The impact might even
    be felt at organizational or societal level: *Has it reduced the number of operational
    incidents impacting customers?* We believe you will quickly start to see positive
    effects in all of these aspects. As a result, maybe you''ll leave us nice reviews
    and tell all your friends about this book. If not, perhaps you can pivot and use
    this book as a doorstop or a monitor stand, which, of course, will give you a
    different type of value!'

    collaboration, community, inclusivity, adaptability, and transparency. We highly

    ways of working that can help our customers and their teams develop digital solutions
    and accelerate business value using open technology and open culture. The main

    the authors have developed named *DevOps Culture and Practice Enablement*. This
    is an immersive training course run by Red Hat, providing enablement to Red Hat
    customers, partners, and employees.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We initially created the course because the services area of Red Hat we are
    working in was growing, and we needed a way to consistently increase the enthusiasm
    and shared understanding behind the practices and culture we were using globally,
    with our customers, and within our own organization. We wanted to do this by exploring
    all of the principal practices we had found to be successful in taking many products
    to market with our customers. This included practices to help understand the why
    and drive the discovery of products, as well as practices that would help us safely,
    securely, and confidently deliver in an iterative and incremental manner. And
    then there was the third outcome, which was having fun. We really couldn't see
    the point in all of this if you couldn't have some fun, banter, and enjoyment
    as you went along — it's one of the key ingredients of that mysterious word culture.

    team sentiment practices, and mob and pair programming. They include the engineering
    practices that many coming to the course would have most strongly associated with

    managers, from infrastructure experts to user experience designers. We felt this
    course offered the opportunity to break down silos. We intentionally do not run
    different tracks for different types of people. The aim is for participants to
    have a shared understanding of all of the practices that can be applied to truly
    appreciate and enable a DevOps culture.
