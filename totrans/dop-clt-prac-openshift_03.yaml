- en: While this book may have been positioned as a book about technology, it is,
    at most, only one-third about technology. DevOps is really all about collaboration.
    We wrote this book because we want to increase your understanding of DevOps, collaboration,
    and cultural and engineering practices on a container platform such as OpenShift.
    We want to make moving to DevOps easier and provide a clearer path for you to
    apply DevOps using OpenShift. We want to excite you when reading this and give
    you some inspiration as to how you can apply DevOps principles and practices.
    We want to equip you to go out and try these new techniques and practices.

  zh: 尽管这本书可能被定位为一本关于技术的书，但它最多只有三分之一是关于技术的。DevOps实际上是关于协作的。我们写这本书是因为我们希望提高你对DevOps、协作以及在像OpenShift这样的容器平台上应用文化和工程实践的理解。我们希望使迁移到DevOps变得更加容易，并为你提供一条更加清晰的路径，让你能在OpenShift上应用DevOps。我们希望你在阅读时感到兴奋，并获得一些灵感，了解如何应用DevOps的原则和实践。我们希望装备你去尝试这些新的技术和实践。

    *What did we, as a group of people, achieve from that?* The impact might even
    be felt at organizational or societal level: *Has it reduced the number of operational
    incidents impacting customers?* We believe you will quickly start to see positive
    effects in all of these aspects. As a result, maybe you''ll leave us nice reviews
    and tell all your friends about this book. If not, perhaps you can pivot and use
    this book as a doorstop or a monitor stand, which, of course, will give you a

    working in was growing, and we needed a way to consistently increase the enthusiasm
    and shared understanding behind the practices and culture we were using globally,
    with our customers, and within our own organization. We wanted to do this by exploring
    all of the principal practices we had found to be successful in taking many products
    to market with our customers. This included practices to help understand the why
    and drive the discovery of products, as well as practices that would help us safely,
    securely, and confidently deliver in an iterative and incremental manner. And
    then there was the third outcome, which was having fun. We really couldn't see

    not being able to address user needs and fixes quickly. She sees the benefit of
    moving to a more product-centric approach rather than a project-centric one. She

    to be able to test and adapt quickly, ship deliverables quicker, adapt to changing
    market conditions, and also improve performance, uptime, recovery times, and more.'

- en: With this book, we want people to move away from being **I-shaped**, where they
    are a specialist in one skill or one field. We want them to become more **T-shaped**,
    where they still have a depth of skill and experience in a particular field (such
    as infrastructure or UX design), but they also have an appreciation and breadth
    of knowledge across all the other skills that people bring to make up a cross-functional
    team. This could be a frontend engineer, for example, who also works side by side
    with the API engineer.

  zh: 通过这本书，我们希望人们能够摆脱**I型**，不再只是专注于一个技能或一个领域的专家。我们希望他们能成为更具**T型**特征的人才，他们在某一特定领域（如基础设施或用户体验设计）仍然有深厚的技能和经验，但也能理解并跨越所有其他技能领域，进而构建跨职能团队。这可能是一个前端工程师的例子，他也与
    API 工程师紧密合作。
- en: 'A great cross-functional team is one where the full team holds all the skills
    and experience they need. They are empowered to take a new requirement from a
    user or business stakeholder through to production. A team could be made up of
    lots of **I-shaped** people, but this type of team quickly becomes dependent on
    specific individuals who can be a blocker when they are not available. For example,
    if a database change is needed to expose a new API but only one team member has
    the knowledge to be able to do this, the team can quickly become stuck. If the
    team is full of more **T-shaped** members, there is a greater opportunity for
    collaboration, sharing, and partnerships across the team and less reliance on
    individuals:'

  zh: 一个优秀的跨职能团队是指整个团队具备所有必要的技能和经验，能够从用户或业务方的需求出发，直到最终的生产交付。一个团队可能由许多**I型**人才组成，但这种团队很快会依赖于某些特定个体，而当这些个体不可用时，团队可能会陷入困境。例如，如果需要进行数据库变更来暴露一个新的
    API，而只有一个团队成员掌握这项知识，团队就可能陷入停滞。如果团队中有更多的**T型**成员，那么团队之间的协作、共享和合作的机会就更大，对个体的依赖也会减少：
