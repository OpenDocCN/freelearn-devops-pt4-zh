			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>What Does It Mean to Be DevOps in a Container World? People have different perceptions about DevOps, what it means, and how it works. </p>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, we are going to explain our view on DevOps and the bottlenecks and challenges that DevOps focuses on addressing. We will introduce the idea of a value chain in <a id="_idIndexMarker043"/><a id="_idIndexMarker044"/>software product delivery and how we can use different <a id="_idIndexMarker045"/><a id="_idIndexMarker046"/>techniques from lean, agile, and DevOps communities to optimize and speed up the value chain.</p>&#13;
			<p>We will also introduce some tools, such as the Mobius Loop and the Open Practice Library that we will use to navigate our way through the many practices utilized in the rest of the book.</p>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">DevOps</strong> is a bit of a buzzword <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/><a id="_idIndexMarker048"/>at the moment! It seems that for every decade in technology, there is a new buzzword associated with it.</p>&#13;
			<p>Throughout the 2010s, Agile was that buzzword—<em class="italics">This is going to be an Agile project</em>, or <em class="italics">We're going to use Agile to deliver this</em>, or <em class="italics">We're going to use the Agile methodology</em> were common phrases that many of us have heard. It was (and still is) often used incorrectly about delivering software faster. In fact, Agile is focused more around delivering business value earlier and more frequently and driving a culture of continuous learning. Agile has now officially grown up—it had its 18<span class="P---Superscript">th</span> birthday in February 2019. Even after all this time, we still love to <a id="_idIndexMarker049"/><a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>use the values and principles of the Agile Manifesto<span id="footnote-006-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-006">1</a></span> created back in 2001.</p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<p>Containers is another buzzword these days. We see it being used by individuals without them necessarily understanding the full meaning of what a container is and why people, teams, and organizations would benefit by utilizing them.</p>&#13;
			<p>So, with this book being about DevOps and OpenShift (a container management platform), we're going to de-buzzify these terms and talk about very practical, real world experience and examples of the real value behind DevOps and OpenShift containers.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's take a look back in time and see where we believe these phenomena came from.</p>&#13;
			<p>We all have worked in IT for a number of decades (some more decades than others!). While chatting over a beer and looking back at our experiences of delivering IT projects, we recognized some common characteristics in all our IT projects that have been constant. We also identified a set of gaps in the value chain of delivering IT projects that, for us, seemed to slow things down.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>The Value Chain</h2>&#13;
			<p>Every project we've ever <a id="_idIndexMarker051"/><a id="_idIndexMarker052"/>worked on <a id="_idIndexMarker053"/><a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>has had some kind of end customer or user. Sometimes they have been external users, such as an online shopper wanting to use their mobile app to buy the latest set of Justin Bieber bedsheets! Other times, they have been teams internal to an organization, such as an operations team or a particular department within a company. One <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/><a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>common denominator we all agree on is that the objective of our work was always having smiley, happy customers:</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p>Between us, we have helped many <a id="_idIndexMarker057"/><a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>organizations, from the public sector and finance to retail and charities. We've seen it all! As we reminisced, we discussed the end result of some of our projects; we thought about our why — there was almost always some kind of monetary value aspect associated with the reason for us being there. There were other motivations, too, such as increased customer satisfaction, reduced risk, and improved security and performance, but the bottom line is that an essential part of any of our commercial customers' business is to make money and reduce costs.</p>&#13;
			<p>So, in the end, value was often linked to money in some shape or form. Three of us authors are Irish and the fourth is from New Zealand, so we felt it was appropriate to reflect this as a pot of gold!</p>&#13;

The idea was further popularized by the book <em class="italics">Lean Thinking</em>, written by the same authors. According to them, the value stream is the sequence of activities an organization undertakes to deliver on a customer request. More broadly, a value stream is the sequence of activities required to design, produce, and deliver a good or service to a customer, and it includes the dual flows of information and material. Most value streams are highly cross-functional: the transformation of a customer request to a good or service flows through many functional departments or work teams within the organization:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure">Figure 2.3: Customers dreaming of the pot of gold </p>&#13;
			<p>Let's visualize this as our customers<a id="_idIndexMarker067"/><a id="_idIndexMarker068"/> dreaming of that pot of gold. They're constantly thinking about how they can get the most out of their products or ideas to generate the most gold. So, how do they go about doing this?</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>The Gaps</h2>&#13;
			<p>We're going to explore the<a id="_idIndexMarker069"/><a id="_idIndexMarker070"/> gaps in the value chain between customers and organization's business people, between business people and development people, and between development people and operations people.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>The Big List of Things to Do</h3>&#13;
			<p>The first gap in the software development process that we consistently saw was the process of collecting information from end customers and <a id="_idIndexMarker071"/><a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>forming a list of customer requirements:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer033" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/B16297_02_04.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 2.4: Understanding and collecting customer requirements</p>&#13;
			<p>Our early projects often involved long phases of business analysts documenting every possible requirement they could conceivably think of into epic volumes of business requirements — documents. The goal was to pre-empt every conceivable customer journey or scenario and to cover all the bases by building specifications that included every possible eventuality. Sounds rigid, right? What if we made an incorrect assumption?</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Demonstrating Value and Building the Right Thing</h3>&#13;
			<p>The second gap revolved around demonstrating value to customers. Usually, the <strong class="bold">project</strong> being undertaken was set up to include all of the features and ideas needed so that they could be released together. Once the project was in production, it would only have a small operations budget to support minor enhancements and problem resolution. Sounds like it might take a long time to get the application into the end users' hands, right?</p>&#13;
			<p>There are two reasons we<a id="_idIndexMarker073"/><a id="_idIndexMarker074"/> call these <em class="italics">gaps</em>. First, the process was lengthy — months, sometimes years, would elapse between starting a project and signing off on the requirements. Second, trying to collect every possible requirement before delivering anything would mean no real benefit to the end customer for years and often, the wrong functionality was built and delivered to an unhappy customer:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer034" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/B16297_02_05.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 2.5: Using human-centered practices to understand customer needs </p>&#13;
			<p>This gap of <em class="italics">not building the right thing</em> has been plugged in recent years by the emergence of human-centered <a id="_idIndexMarker075"/><a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>design and design thinking. These are a set of practices that put the end user at the center of capturing the needs and requirements of a product.</p>&#13;
			<p>We gather the information by<a id="_idIndexMarker077"/><a id="_idIndexMarker078"/> talking directly to users and forming greater <em class="italics">empathy</em><span id="footnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-005">2</a></span> with them:</p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<div>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 2.6: Merriam-Webster definition of 'empathy' </p>&#13;
			<p>In this book, we'll explore how techniques such as impact mapping, event storming, and human-centered design can <a id="_idIndexMarker079"/><a id="_idIndexMarker080"/>aid the software development process. We'll also explore other practices to help us define solutions and features and crucially ensure that the solution is connected to business value. We'll show how the act of coupling research activities such as user interface prototypes and technical spikes with experimentation inform product backlogs that are well prioritized according to delivered business value. We will show you how using just enough information can lead to a better-understood product.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>How Do We Do the Things on Our List?</h3>&#13;
			<p>Let's consider the second gap in delivering value to users. This gap focuses on moving from a shopping list of TODO items into working software.</p>&#13;
			<p>The traditional approach is to sign off and confirm a finite set of requirements that have undergone the lengthy process of business analysis and capture. The scope of the project is locked down and a stringent change control process and governance is put in place for dealing with any deviation from the documented requirements.</p>&#13;
			<div id="footnote-005" class="_idFootnote" epub:type="footnote">&#13;
				<p class="FootNote"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-005-backlink">2</a>	<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empath">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empath</a></p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>A team of software designers and architects then gets to work, producing a <strong class="bold">high-level design</strong> (<strong class="bold">HLD</strong>) that will deliver a solution or <a id="_idIndexMarker081"/><a id="_idIndexMarker082"/>set of solutions according to the business requirements specified. These requirements also go through a formal review process by key project stakeholders and, once signed off, become the reference source for the solution scope.</p>&#13;
			<p>Often, different design documents <a id="_idIndexMarker083"/><a id="_idIndexMarker084"/>are written in the next phase - detail design documents, program <a id="_idIndexMarker085"/><a id="_idIndexMarker086"/>specifications, data <a id="_idIndexMarker087"/><a id="_idIndexMarker088"/>designs, logical architecture blueprints, physical <a id="_idIndexMarker089"/><a id="_idIndexMarker090"/>architecture <a id="_idIndexMarker091"/><a id="_idIndexMarker092"/>solutions, and many<a id="_idIndexMarker093"/><a id="_idIndexMarker094"/> more. Each of these is written to support a defined, dated, and signed-off version of the HLD, which itself, is signed off against a defined set of business <a id="_idIndexMarker095"/><a id="_idIndexMarker096"/>requirement specifications:</p>&#13;
			<p> </p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 2.7: Traditional application development lifecycle</p>&#13;
			<p>Any changes to the <a id="_idIndexMarker097"/><a id="_idIndexMarker098"/>earlier documents have direct time and cost implications for reassessing and updating each of the following design documents. Software development teams may have been involved in the production or review of some of these documents. However, they are often encouraged not to start any coding or development activities until these designs have been locked down. Some organizations reduce project costs by not onboarding development teams until this stage. Development is often siloed by function and unaware of the big picture with limited automated testing.</p>&#13;
			<p>At a predefined point in the project plan, all developers are expected to have delivered their coded components to a testing environment. Perhaps each developer manually builds and deploys their own code to the testing environment. Some larger programs seek economies of scale by setting up build infrastructure teams who do this on behalf of all developers. Once all components had been delivered, a separate team of testers starts executing the hundreds of test scripts they had been writing in the preceding weeks and months to test the solution according to business requirements and HLD documentation. This is the first time some components are integrated and tested together. Of course, problems and bugs drive reworking by development teams and designers to fix such issues.</p>&#13;
			<p>Just as there are different levels <a id="_idIndexMarker099"/><a id="_idIndexMarker100"/>of design documentation, testing often undergoes different levels of testing, with one starting when the previous phase is completed. A test manager would sign off on a set of test results, signaling that the next level of testing could start. Testing would range from a set of component integration testing to wider system integration testing, security and penetration testing, performance testing, failover and operability testing, and finally, user acceptance testing!</p>&#13;
			<p>The final stage before the big-bang go-live of a solution would often be user acceptance testing, involving a set of focus users and the test system. In many cases, it could often be months or years before this first user saw the implemented system. Once user acceptance of the solution was signed off, the green light was given to deploy to the production environment. Finally, with the software in the hands of real end users, business revenue could hopefully be generated from all this work.</p>&#13;
			<p>You're probably thinking that this process sounds long and drawn out — well in truth, it was! Many programs hit delays at different points along the way and what started out as a multi-month project plan ended up being years long. For the curious, there is even a list of some epic failures on Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_failed_and_overbudget_custom_software_projects">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_failed_and_overbudget_custom_software_projects</a>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Often, business conditions would change during the development period. New feature requests would be generated. During testing, gaps in the requirements would emerge that no one considered during the analysis and requirements capture. The market didn't stand still during development and competitor companies may have started to innovate quicker. The competition would even provide more feature requests, in a process akin to a feature comparison war.</p>&#13;
			<p>Of course, there was always some kind of change control procedure to handle new scope like this. In a complex program of work, the lead time to get features added to the work plan could range from months to years. In order to get something into production, program <a id="_idIndexMarker101"/><a id="_idIndexMarker102"/>executives would simply say no to any more change and just focus on getting to the end of the project plan.</p>&#13;
			<p>This meant that solutions finally delivered to production were somewhat underwhelming to users several years after the first requirements were discussed. Time and industry had moved on. The biggest frustration of these programs was that they were frequently delivered late, were over budget, and often delivered a solution that lacked user satisfaction or quality.</p>&#13;
			<p>Stepping back a little, we had this huge gap of converting lists of features into a software deliverable. The process known as <strong class="bold">Waterfall</strong> due to <a id="_idIndexMarker103"/><a id="_idIndexMarker104"/>the nature of separate phases of work flowing down to the next phase was associated with very lengthy times:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer037" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/B16297_02_08.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 2.8: Traditional deliverables with its drawbacks failed to achieve customer satisfaction</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's think about how <a id="_idIndexMarker105"/><a id="_idIndexMarker106"/>we plug that second gap with more modern software development processes. How do modern developers manage to translate user needs into working software solutions much more quickly compared to previous ways of working?</p>&#13;
			<p>The formation of the Agile movement in 2001, led by the 17 IT individuals who wrote the Agile Manifesto, has triggered <a id="_idIndexMarker107"/><a id="_idIndexMarker108"/>alternative approaches and mindsets toward delivering software. Many of the individuals involved in writing the Agile Manifesto had been tackling many of the problems described by Waterfall development. Jeff Sutherland and Ken Shwaber had <a id="_idIndexMarker109"/><a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>created the Scrum framework for software development, which included delivering small incremental releases of value much more frequently — they used the term <strong class="bold">sprint</strong>, which<a id="_idIndexMarker111"/><a id="_idIndexMarker112"/> was a fixed timebox ranging from one to four weeks (usually being two weeks), during which a set of events and roles would work together such that big solutions could be delivered iteratively and incrementally. Kent Beck and Ron Jefferies led much <a id="_idIndexMarker113"/><a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>of the <strong class="bold">eXtreme Programming</strong> (<strong class="bold">XP</strong>) movement, focusing on delivering faster releases of value and working on key practices that helped drive more efficiency into review, testing, and release processes, using better collaboration and increased automation:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer038" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 2.9: Implementation of DevOps practices leading to faster delivery and better products</p>&#13;
			<p>In this book, we'll show you <a id="_idIndexMarker115"/><a id="_idIndexMarker116"/>different software delivery practices and how our experience using a mixture of different practices from Scrum, Kanban, XP, Lean, and some scaling frameworks helps deliver value <a id="_idIndexMarker117"/><a id="_idIndexMarker118"/>quicker. All the underlying practices are simply tools to help close the gap between an idea or requirement being captured and it being delivered. This has been an area we have sought to continuously improve to a level where the gaps are minimized and we're working in a mode of continuous delivery.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Development to Operations</h3>&#13;
			<p>There is one more gap to plug in our efforts to optimize the software delivery process. The third gap is the one between development teams and operations teams.</p>&#13;
			<p>In our Waterfall process, we had reached the point where the signed-off solution exited user acceptance testing and went through a big-bang go-live. So, what happened next?</p>&#13;
			<p>Often, a whole new team responsible for maintenance and support would then pick up the solution. The people who work in this new team were not involved in any of the design, development, or testing, so additional time would be built into the project plan for knowledge transfer. The delivery team would write lengthy documentation in the hope that this would be a useful resource for future operations teams.</p>&#13;
			<p>At this point, the package of software would metaphorically be thrown over the wall from the army of developers to the group of operation engineers. The operations teams often had to learn about the software the hard way by investigating production incidents, addressing bugs that <a id="_idIndexMarker119"/><a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>were not found previously, and handling new scenarios not considered during the requirement planning stage:</p>&#13;
			<p> </p>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 2.10: Aspiring to bring down the wall between development and operations teams</p>&#13;
			<p>To plug this gap, we must bring development and operations teams together. Tear down that wall and remove the silos! Bringing down the wall forms new teams that are focused on development and operations activities. These teams are collectively responsible for the whole solution and can design the solution according to each others' needs.</p>&#13;
			<p>The term DevOps was coined by the idea that we no longer have siloed development and operations teams. In recent <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/><a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>years, we've<a id="_idIndexMarker123"/> seen various other terms emerge from this idea, such as DevSecOps, BizDevOps, DesOps and <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/><a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>even BizDesDevSecOps!</p>&#13;
			<h4>Note</h4>&#13;
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">BizDesDevSecOps</strong> is a bit of a<a id="_idIndexMarker126"/><a id="_idIndexMarker127"/> mouthful, so we're going to use<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/><a id="_idIndexMarker129"/> the term <strong class="bold">product team</strong> to describe it throughout this book. It addresses the ultimate goal of plugging all gaps in the software development process and bringing down all the walls.</p>&#13;
			<p> </p>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 2.11: Plugging the gaps in the software delivery process</p>&#13;
			<p>Note that we will not use the <a id="_idIndexMarker130"/><a id="_idIndexMarker131"/><strong class="bold">DevOps team </strong>term <strong class="bold">DevOps team </strong>— the idea of having a team or even an individual purely focused on DevOps runs counter to what the DevOps philosophy is all about — collaboration, cross-functionality, and the removal of silos. How many times have you seen ads on LinkedIn or other sites looking for DevOps engineers? The invention of the DevOps engineer or the DevOps team could be seen as creating just another silo.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>People, Process, and Technology</h2>&#13;
			<p>DevOps is really all about collaboration. It's about taking pride in, and ownership of, the solution you're building by<a id="_idIndexMarker132"/><a id="_idIndexMarker133"/> bringing down walls and silos and by removing bottlenecks and obstacles. This speeds up the value stream connecting the customer's perceived need to the product delivery.</p>&#13;
			<p>Technology alone will never solve all your business problems. No matter how good the platform or software product you are evaluating or being sold, unless your organization has learned to adopt the correct balance of people aspects, process changes, and technology adoption, the objectives will not be met.</p>&#13;
			<p>This book is about finding the right combination of people, process, and technology changes needed to maximize <a id="_idIndexMarker134"/><a id="_idIndexMarker135"/>business outcomes on a continuous basis. This requires changes in mindset and changes in behavior. This book will look at the behavioral change that we have seen be most effective with the hundreds of organizations we have collectively worked with. We've observed that such mindset and behavioral change is needed across all roles and that we need to break down the silos we see inside organizations, which, as we saw previously, is what drives the gaps and inefficiencies in software development:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure"> Figure 2.12: A healthy balance between people, process, and technology</p>&#13;
			<p>Everyone in an organization should care about people, process engineering, and technology in order to drive the desired outcomes. We want to break down the silos between these three pillars and bring them closer together. A reader who may be more interested and focused in one of these three things will get as much (if not more) value from learning about the other two things.</p>&#13;
			<p>This means a hardcore software engineer or architect can pick up some great insights and guidance on why people, culture, and collaboration are equally important for their role. </p>&#13;
			<p>Someone who has previously been an expert in project management methodologies and is now learning about more agile delivery practices such as Scrum can also use this book to learn about modern technology approaches such as GitOps, CI/CD, and serverless. They can learn why these are important to understand and appreciate so that they can articulate the business value such approaches bring to organizations.</p>&#13;
			<p>A leader who is concerned about employee retention can learn how the mastery of these modern tech practices of iterative and incremental delivery strategies can maximize the opportunities for organizational success through the delivery of highly valuable products being<a id="_idIndexMarker136"/><a id="_idIndexMarker137"/> used by happy customers.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>The Mobius Loop and the Open Practice Library</h2>&#13;
			<p>In this book, we're going to explore lots of different practices. We're going to explain what they are and why we use them. We're going to give you some guidance on how to use them. We're going to share some real-world examples of how we've used them and, where possible, we'll even show them in action. Using our Pet Battle case study (more on that later), we're going to bring them to life in a fun way and we'll share the best tips that we've picked up in the field.</p>&#13;
			<p>A problem we hit a few years ago when working with our customers' new teams was explaining how and when you might want to use different practices and in what order. What practice should we start with? What practice links nicely to the output produced from a previous practice, and so on?</p>&#13;
			<p>To help with this, we have made use of an open-source navigator tool called Mobius. This was created by <a id="_idIndexMarker138"/><a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>Gabrielle Benefield and<a id="_idIndexMarker140"/><a id="_idIndexMarker141"/> Ryan Shriver.

			<p>Mobius is a framework that <a id="_idIndexMarker146"/><a id="_idIndexMarker147"/>connects discovery and delivery and can be used to connect strategy to products to operations. The common denominator is measurable outcomes. Mobius is used to understand, align, and share measurable target outcomes so they can be tested and validated.</p>&#13;
			<p>There are a number of principles that <a id="_idIndexMarker148"/><a id="_idIndexMarker149"/>underpin the Mobius navigator:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Outcomes over outputs</strong>: We focus on delivering tangible impacts or outcomes to people as opposed to delivering lots of features that may not drive outcomes.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Multi-options strategy</strong> (<strong class="bold">options pivot</strong>): We look to build a list of options, a list of research initiatives, experiments, and <a id="_idIndexMarker150"/><a id="_idIndexMarker151"/>implementation features that can be used to test hypotheses about whether those research initiatives, experiments, and implementation features will indeed drive the anticipated outcomes.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Rapid delivery</strong>: We aim to use short iterations of delivery with regular feedback and measurement as we strive toward the idea of continuous delivery.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Continuous learning and improvement</strong>: happens <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/><a id="_idIndexMarker153"/>throughout the cycle so that our next set of options<a id="_idIndexMarker154"/><a id="_idIndexMarker155"/> yield an even better impact on outcomes.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>There are <strong class="bold">seven core elements</strong> to the Mobius approach across a continuous and never-ending flow. They can be visualized on a single canvas that is open source and made available under a <a id="_idIndexMarker156"/><a id="_idIndexMarker157"/>creative commons license at <a href="http://www.mobiusloop.com">www.mobiusloop.com</a>:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Why</strong> describes the purpose. Why are we doing this? What is the problem we are trying to solve? What is the idea we are trying to pursue?</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Who</strong> focuses on the end users. Who are we trying to solve the problem for?</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Outcomes</strong> are where we want to get to with these people, the changes in their human behavior that influences big results, and how we will measure the customer and business impacts delivered.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Options</strong> are the potential solutions that could deliver these outcomes. They help define the hypotheses we can go on to test and help us find the simplest way to achieve the desired outcome with the least amount of effort or output.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Deliver</strong> is the cycle where we<a id="_idIndexMarker158"/><a id="_idIndexMarker159"/> run experiments to deliver a solution or set of solutions to users so we can measure the impact.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Measure</strong> is where we assess what happened as a result of delivering the solution or set of solutions. We check whether the impact of the solution delivered the desired outcomes and assess how much of an impact we achieved.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Learn</strong> is the feedback loop that takes us back to the options pivot. We learn from what we delivered and assess what to do next. Have we delivered enough to make an assessment? Do we go right back around the delivery loop again? Have we reached our target outcomes or invalidated assumptions from our learnings? Do we return to the discovery loop?</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Personas such as Tadhg, our user experience designer, would typically spend a lot of time in the discovery loop. Personas such as Caoimhe, our technical lead, would traditionally be focused on the delivery loop. Personas such as Fionn, our project manager, would <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/><a id="_idIndexMarker161"/>typically spend a lot of time here establishing outcomes and gathering options. But, as we seek to move to cross-functional teams of T- or M-shaped people, we really benefit from everyone being involved at every stage of the Mobius loop. And Mobius creates a common language based on targeted measurable outcomes.</p>&#13;
			<p>You can apply the same principles<a id="_idIndexMarker162"/><a id="_idIndexMarker163"/> of outcome-driven thinking for <a id="_idIndexMarker164"/><a id="_idIndexMarker165"/>strategy, product, and services delivery to enabling business and technical operations — we'll return to this idea later in the book.</p>&#13;
			<p>Mobius is powerful because<a id="_idIndexMarker166"/><a id="_idIndexMarker167"/> it's framework agnostic. It integrates with many existing frameworks and methods you may already be familiar with — Scrum, Kanban, design thinking, Lean UX, Business <a id="_idIndexMarker168"/><a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>Model Generation, Lean <a id="_idIndexMarker170"/><a id="_idIndexMarker171"/>startup, and many other great frameworks that have surfaced during the last couple of decades. You don't have to reinvent the wheel or replace everything you already like and that works for you.</p>&#13;
			<p>You can capture key information on a discovery map, an options map, and a delivery map — all of these are open source <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/><a id="_idIndexMarker173"/>artifacts available under <strong class="bold">Creative Commons</strong> at <a href="http://www.mobiusloop.com">www.mobiusloop.com</a>:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure">Figure 2.14: Using the Discovery, Options, and Delivery canvases of the Mobius loop</p>&#13;
			<p>When Red Hat Open Innovation Labs started using Mobius, we placed all of our practices around the Mobius loop. Some practices clearly aligned with the discovery loop and, in particular, the <strong class="bold">Why &amp; Who</strong> end of the discovery loop. Practices such as impact <a id="_idIndexMarker174"/><a id="_idIndexMarker175"/>mapping, start-at-the-end, and empathy mapping are<a id="_idIndexMarker176"/><a id="_idIndexMarker177"/> great at uncovering the answers posed in this section of the loop. We'll get into the detail of these practices in subsequent chapters of this book.</p>&#13;
			<p>Practices such as <a id="_idIndexMarker178"/>event storming and user story mapping were very helpful in establishing and visualizing outcomes on the other side of the discovery loop. Again, we'll look at these practices in detail and share some great examples of their effect.</p>&#13;
			<p>Practices such <a id="_idIndexMarker179"/><a id="_idIndexMarker180"/>as design sprints, how-might-we, and product backlog refinement would help determine and organize the <a id="_idIndexMarker181"/><a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>series of options available <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/><a id="_idIndexMarker184"/>attempting to drive toward outcomes.</p>&#13;
			<p>Practices such as sprint planning would help plan<a id="_idIndexMarker185"/><a id="_idIndexMarker186"/> and execute the incremental delivery of products toward outcomes. We'll explore these iterative delivery practices and how different Agile frameworks can be used with Mobius.</p>&#13;
			<p>Practices such as showcases and retrospectives would help<a id="_idIndexMarker187"/><a id="_idIndexMarker188"/> with capturing measure-and-learn data from incremental delivery.</p>&#13;
			<p>We still had a large number of practices that we did not feel naturally fitted into one of the loops or the options pivot. When we laid out all of the remaining practices that we had all used with numerous customers very effectively, we found they fitted into one of two areas. One set of practices were all focused on creating culture and collaboration. The other practices were all technical engineering practices that supported the concept of continuous delivery.</p>&#13;
			<p>When explaining these practices to others, we talked about these being very important practices to put in place, but not necessarily practices that you would schedule. For example, you will learn that practices such as impact mapping on the discovery loop are important scheduled workshops that you execute and occasionally revisit in the future. Practices such as sprint planning, showcases, and retrospectives on the delivery loop are also tightly scheduled when working in an iterative delivery framework. But the practices associated with culture and collaboration or those associated with technical engineering were more like practices that you use all the time, continuously.</p>&#13;
			<p>Practices such as social contracts and definition of done are not one-time-only practices where you bring the artifact out on a schedule. These are living and breathing artifacts that teams use all the time<a id="_idIndexMarker189"/><a id="_idIndexMarker190"/> in their day-to-day work. Likewise, continuous integration, test automation, and<a id="_idIndexMarker191"/><a id="_idIndexMarker192"/> infrastructure as code — these are not the types of practices you schedule one or two times a week. These are practices that you do all the time. They are practices in the foundation of where and how we're working. In order to effectively practice continuous delivery and continuous discovery as presented by the Mobius loop, we need to have a strong foundation of culture, collaboration, and technical engineering practices.</p>&#13;
			<p>To visualize this, we added the foundation<a id="_idIndexMarker193"/><a id="_idIndexMarker194"/> to the Mobius loop:</p>&#13;
			<p> </p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			<p class="figure">Figure 2.15: Adding a foundation to the Mobius loop</p>&#13;
			<p>This graphic has become a simple visualization tool that helps us navigate the ever-growing list of practices and techniques we use to achieve continuous discovery and continuous delivery of digital products:</p>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 2.16: Practicing continuous discovery and delivery through the Mobius loop </p>&#13;
			<p>Open Innovation Labs Residencies involves traveling around the Mobius loop a few times, usually starting from discovery before proceeding to delivery and then pivoting a few times to either more delivery or returning to discovery continuously. We find that, in order for this to be sustainable, you must build a foundation of culture and collaboration and you must build a strong foundation of technical engineering practices.</p>&#13;
			<p>Open Innovation Labs kick-started an open source, community-driven project called the Open Practice Library. The <a id="_idIndexMarker195"/><a id="_idIndexMarker196"/>Open Practice Library is a community-driven repository of practices and tools. These are shared by people currently using them day-to-day for people looking to be inspired with new ideas and experience.</p>&#13;
			<p>All of the practices you read about in this book have been contributed to the Open Practice Library and, throughout the book, we will use the Mobius loop and the foundation of culture, collaboration, and technical practices as a reference point to determine where and how all our open practices fit together to deliver great DevOps culture and practice with OpenShift.</p>&#13;
			<p>An important characteristic of Mobius and the Open Practice Library is that it is not prescriptive. It is not a methodology. It does not tell you exactly which practice to use when and where. Think of the Open Practice Library as a box of tools — a really well-organized toolbox with lots of compartments and shelves. The practices have been organized into <a id="_idIndexMarker197"/><a id="_idIndexMarker198"/>compartments that help with discovery and, in particular, the <em class="italics">why</em> and <em class="italics">who</em>, followed by deriving outcomes. There is a drawer containing all the tools that help form, organize, and prioritize options and how to pivot later in the cycle. There is a portion of the toolbox with all of the tools that help with delivery — whether that be iterative and incremental delivery associated with agile practices or single delivery associated with Waterfall. There are tools to help capture and understand the measurements and learning from delivery. Finally, there is a huge drawer of tools used to establish culture, collaboration, and technical engineering excellence. These are often the first tools we go to grab when starting a piece of work.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Conclusion </h2>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, we introduced the value chain in software product delivery and explored how traditional ways of working brought inefficiencies, bottlenecks and gaps between users, business stakeholders, development teams, and operational teams.</p>&#13;
			<p>We explored some of the techniques that have been used to plug these gaps and how a balanced focus on people, process, and technology is needed by all involved.</p>&#13;
			<p>Finally, we introduced the open-source navigator tool called Mobius that connects discovery and delivery in an infinite loop and can connect strategy to product to operations with a common denominator of measurable outcomes. The Open Practice Library uses mobius on a foundation of culture and technology to navigate between an evolving number of open practices — many of which will be explained in subsequent chapters.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the next chapter, we're going to outline how we'll approach the rest of the book by introducing our case study and the structure for the remaining sections.</p>&#13;
