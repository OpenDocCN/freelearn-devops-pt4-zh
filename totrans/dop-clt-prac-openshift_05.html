			<p>As we conclude the first section of this book, this chapter will explain the journey we intend to take you through the remaining sections.</p>&#13;
			<p>This will include how we intend to not just tell you about practices and techniques but also show them in action and apply them. We'll introduce a fun case study and real world stories to do this.</p>&#13;
			<p>One of the challenges of writing a book intended to be read by a diverse group of people with different skill sets and backgrounds is how to write it in such a way that means it can be <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/><a id="_idIndexMarker200"/>consumed, understood, and appreciated by all. From tech leads, infrastructure engineers, and OpenShift <a id="_idIndexMarker201"/><a id="_idIndexMarker202"/>specialists, to Agile coaches, user experience designers, and <a id="_idIndexMarker203"/><a id="_idIndexMarker204"/>project managers, to IT leaders and CXOs, we want you to grasp a shared understanding of what's behind all the practices being taught and the principles that underpin then.</p>&#13;
			<p>The topics covered are going to range from how to capture behaviors in an empathy map using human-centered design practices to considering observability within applications <a id="_idIndexMarker205"/><a id="_idIndexMarker206"/>using performance metrics. It will look at ways to help product owners prioritize value versus risk<a id="_idIndexMarker207"/><a id="_idIndexMarker208"/> while also <a id="_idIndexMarker209"/><a id="_idIndexMarker210"/>addressing instrumentation for<a id="_idIndexMarker211"/><a id="_idIndexMarker212"/> applications, image tagging, and metadata!</p>&#13;
			<p>Similar to the definition of done practice we use on our DevOps culture and practice enablement course, we're going to use a few different approaches in this book to help you with your journey:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li>Explaining the culture and practice</li>&#13;
				<li>Showing the culture and practice</li>&#13;
				<li>Applying the culture and practice</li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>To explain the culture and practice, we will introduce what the <a id="_idIndexMarker213"/>practice is and why and where we've chosen to use it, and give some guidance on how to use it. In some ways, this is the easy part.</p>&#13;
			<p>We have a saying among us that we prefer to <strong class="bold">show, not tell</strong>. It's easy to research and write a load of words. It's far more compelling to visually show a practice in action and the effect it is having. To show the culture and practice, we have a few techniques:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">As much as possible, we'll aim to make use of visualization techniques such as sketch notes, diagrams, and other charts. You will have seen a few of these, beautifully <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/><a id="_idIndexMarker215"/>drawn by Ilaria Doria, in this section already, and hopefully, they have helped bring the words to life a little.</li>&#13;
				<li>Where we can show you a practice in action through photographs or reproduced artifacts, we will do so. Where possible, we have made the diagrams and other visual artifacts open source, and they are available at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/DevOps-Culture-and-Practice-with-OpenShift/">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/DevOps-Culture-and-Practice-with-OpenShift/</a>.</li>&#13;
				<li>We find stories and real-world examples the best way to explain a practice and the value it brings. So, from time to time, we will break away and tell a story that one or more of the authors have experienced connected with these practices. We'll visually tell these stories on their own by having a box around the story. Let's start with one now:</li>&#13;

			<p>In December 2005, I was working in the billing workstream of a large telecommunications billing system replacement program in the UK. I'd been working on this program for 18 months already at this point. It was a 10-year program to replace all legacy billing systems with a more modern COTS software and introduce some new business capability enabling flexible and changeable product management. </p>&#13;
			<p>I lead the billing interfaces workstream and was responsible for the delivery of interfaces between billing systems and third parties such as banks, BACS, and the treasury. </p>&#13;
			<p>Our workstream was having our Christmas dinner in a pub near the office. We'd chosen this pub because most of us had been to the same pub 12 months previously for last year's Christmas dinner. It was funny to see so many of us in the same place around the same time of year 12 months on. </p>&#13;
			<p>When I was there, I reflected on the last 12 months and what had been achieved by our expensive team of consultants during the period. It dawned on me that 12 months ago, we were entering the design phase of a major release of the program. We were running a series of workshops over several weeks to map out the different work products and deliverables required for the release. </p>&#13;
			<p>12 months on, we were still in that design phase. A workstream of over 60 people had spent a year writing, rewriting, refining, and writing again design documents, more design documents, variations of design documents, technical clarification notes against design documents, and even change requests against design documents. At this point, no code had been written, no tests had been run, and no software had been released. All we had produced from 12 months was lots of design documents and lots of meetings. </p>&#13;
			<p>I remember feeling somewhat underwhelmed by the impact of what we'd achieved in the last year. I said to myself then, <em class="italics">There has to be a better way of delivering software</em>.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
			<p>Finally, we want to apply some of the <a id="_idIndexMarker216"/><a id="_idIndexMarker217"/>culture and practices for real. To help us do that, we are going to use a simple, fun case study about a small start up organization going through some of the challenges and hurdles associated with creating a DevOps culture and establishing DevOps practices. This story will represent an anonymized account of some of the things we've seen in the field with our customers using these practices.</p>&#13;
			<p>We'll regularly return to this story of applying DevOps culture and practices using OpenShift in shaded boxes. Let's get this rolling with the backstory — we hope you're ready for this!</p>&#13;

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>PetBattle – the Backstory</h2>&#13;
			<p>Pictures of domestic cats are some of the most widely viewed content on the internet<span id="footnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-007">1</a></span>. Is this true? Who knows! Maybe it's true. What we do know is that they make a great backstory for the example application we use in this book to help explain a number of DevOps practices:</p>&#13;

			&#13;
			<p style="text-align:center;">Figure 3.1: PetBattle — The backstory</p>&#13;
			<p>PetBattle is a hobbyist app, started for fun, hacked around with so that the authors can <strong class="bold">Cat versus Cat</strong> battle each other in a simple online forum. A <strong class="bold">My cat is better than your cat</strong><em class="italics"> type of thing</em>. There are very few bells and whistles to the initial architecture — there is a simple web-based user interface and an API layer coupled with a NoSQL database.</p>&#13;
			<p>PetBattle begins life deployed on a single virtual machine. It's online but not attracting a lot of visitors. It's mainly frequented by the authors' friends and family.</p>&#13;
			<p>While on holiday in an exotic paradise, one of the authors happensed to meet an online influencer. They date, they have a holiday romance, and PetBattle suddenly becomes Insta-famous! Nearly overnight, there was a drastically increased number of players, the PetBattle server crashes, and malicious pictures of <strong class="bold">not</strong> cats start appearing on the child-friendly application.</p>&#13;
			<p>Back from holiday, the authors suddenly find themselves needing to earn a living from PetBattle and decide that developing a business and a production-ready version of the hobbyist app is now a viable thing to do.</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p>The scene is set for the PetBattle founders to go on an exciting journey embracing DevOps culture and practice with OpenShift.<a id="_idTextAnchor043"/></p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>What about Legacy Systems?</h2>&#13;
			<p>People often <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/><a id="_idIndexMarker219"/>associate Agile and DevOps with greenfield, brand-new development and see it as only applicable to start-ups and those with the luxury to start again. <em class="italics">What about legacy systems?</em> is a common question we get asked.</p>&#13;
			<p>We'll show throughout this book that the Mobius loop and the foundation can apply to any kind of project and any kind of technology; greenfield or brownfield, small web app or large mainframe, on-premises infrastructure delivery or hybrid cloud technology.</p>&#13;
			<p>We tend to start our journey on the Mobius loop at the <em class="italics">discovery</em> part (after building the base foundation of culture, collaboration, and technical practices). But you don't have to start there. In fact, you can start anywhere on the loop. The most important tip is to make sure you regularly travel around all parts of the loop. Do not get stuck in delivery loops and never return to discovery to revisit hypotheses and assumptions previously made. Do not get stuck in discovery where you're moving so slowly, you're getting stuck in <strong class="bold">analysis paralysis</strong> and risk missing market windows and never delivering value. Most importantly, never forget to keep building on the foundation of culture, collaboration, and technical practices.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Borrowing Brilliance</h2>&#13;
			<p>Before we start to dive deeper into the detail, we should take a moment to point out that we did not write or dream up any of the practices in this book. The practices in this book and in the Open Practice Library are a growing list of contributions of some brilliant minds. We have borrowed that brilliance and will attribute it to the brilliant minds that came up with it. We hope we have attributed everyone correctly and any omissions are purely accidental.</p>&#13;
			<p>What we have attempted to do with this book is show how these practices, when connected together, have delivered some highly impactful outcomes for organizations and show some of the underlying principles needed to enable those outcomes.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>What to Expect from the Rest of This Book?</h2>&#13;
			<p>So, you've almost made it to the end of this first section. Thanks for sticking with us so far! We hope you're feeling suitably enthused and motivated to read some more and have enough trust in us to want to read what we've written.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you need just a little bit more information about what to expect, here's a short overview.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Section 2 — Establishing the Foundation</h3>&#13;
			<p>In this section, we'll look much deeper into the importance of establishing a foundation both culturally and technically. We'll look again at the purpose motive — the <strong class="bold">start with why</strong> that we <a id="_idIndexMarker220"/><a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>kicked off this book with and how that should be the starting point for any product or any team. We'll look at some of our favorite and most powerful practices we've used to help create the foundation and culture of collaboration — social contracts, stop-the-world andon cords, real-time retrospectives, creating team identity, and getting into the habit of visualizing everything and having a cycle of inspection and adaptation. A relentless focus on creating an environment of psychological safety is a key success factor when establishing the foundation. We'll explain what this is and how we can help achieve it.</p>&#13;
			<p>We'll explore how executive sponsorship can enable and impede a successful foundation and explore deeper what it means to be open in terms of technology and culture. We'll look into how Agile decision-making works and some of the useful tools and practices that can help with this. And we'll look at the adoption approach and how to convince the doubters and skeptics!</p>&#13;
			<p>From a technical foundation perspective, we're going to share some of our most successful approaches, including the visualization of technology through a big picture, the <strong class="bold">green from go</strong> philosophy, and how we treat <strong class="bold">everything as code</strong>. We'll introduce some of the baseline metrics we've used to<a id="_idIndexMarker222"/><a id="_idIndexMarker223"/> measure the success and impact of DevOps culture and <a id="_idIndexMarker224"/><a id="_idIndexMarker225"/>practices. We'll even set the scene for some of the technical practice trade offs and approaches to consider when creating your foundation — GitFlow — versus Trunk-based development, setting up development workflows, considering different types of testing, and setting up an environment for pairing and mobbing.</p>&#13;
			<p>To show and not tell, establishing the foundation is about turning the picture on the left into the picture on the right:</p>&#13;

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Section 3 — Discover It</h3>&#13;
			<p>Here, we'll dive into the discovery loop of Mobius and look at some of the best ways to use it. We'll share some of our favorite and most impactful practices from the Open Practice Library that have helped us in the discovery loop, including<a id="_idIndexMarker226"/><a id="_idIndexMarker227"/> impact mapping, human-centered design, and event storming.</p>&#13;
			<p>We'll look at how this relates to technology and the idea <a id="_idIndexMarker228"/><a id="_idIndexMarker229"/>of emerging architecture and enabling true continuous delivery.</p>&#13;
			<p>From a business perspective, we'll explore the difference between outcomes and outputs and how we're trying to move from the idea of more features being better to creating powerful outcomes with fewer features. We'll explore some practices for how we can continuously measure outcomes and how we can radiate information from the entire discovery loop on open source canvases.</p>&#13;
			<p>To show and not tell, we'll look at moving discovery from looking like what you see on the left to what you see on the right:</p>&#13;

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Section 4 — Prioritize It</h3>&#13;
			<p>Here, we'll dive into the options pivot of Mobius and see why living, breathing, and always-changing options are important. We'll explore practices such as user story mapping and value slicing that help us with this and share some of the gotcha stories we have of where this has been misunderstood and misused. We'll look at how we go about building that initial product backlog using discovery that leads to options pivot practices. We'll look at different types of items that end up in product backlogs, which range from research work to experimentation work and implementation work. We'll look at some economic prioritization models and how to assess the trade-offs between value and risk with the mindset of continuous experimentation and continuous learning. We have lots of stories to share — some with a specific focus area and some with a thin thread of learning across many areas.</p>&#13;
			<p>To show and not tell, we'll see how prioritization can go from looking like what's on the left to what's on the right:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure">Figure 3.4: Using the Options pivot to prioritize backlog items</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Section 5 — Deliver It</h3>&#13;
			<p>In this section, we'll look at Agile delivery and where and when it is applicable according to levels of complexity and simplicity. We'll also look at Waterfall and the relative merits and where it might be appropriate. We'll explore different agile frameworks out there and how all of them relate to the Open Practice Library and Mobius loop. We'll explore the importance of visualization and of capturing measurements and learning. Technology-wise, we'll look at how advanced deployment techniques now available help underpin some of the experimentation and learning approaches being driven.</p>&#13;
			<p>To show and not tell, we'll see about getting delivery from looking like the picture on the left to something like the picture on the right:</p>&#13;

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>Section 6 — Build It, Run It, Own It</h3>&#13;
			<p>This section really focuses on technology as an enabler and why it is important to have an application platform.</p>&#13;
			<p>We'll return to the philosophy of everything-as-code and look at Git and Helm as enablers for this. We'll dive deeper into containers and the cloud-native (the cloud, the platform, and the container) ecosystem. We'll explore OpenShift and Cloud IDE, as well as<a id="_idIndexMarker230"/><a id="_idIndexMarker231"/> pipelines that enable continuous integration, including Jenkins and Tekton. We'll explore emerging deployment and configuration approaches, such as GitOps through ArgoCD, with guidance on how and where to store configuration. We'll explore advanced deployment techniques, such as A/B testing, feature toggles, canary deployments, and blue/green deployments, and how these are used with business outcome experimentation. We'll look at non-functional aspects of DevOps practices, including <strong class="bold">Open Policy Agent</strong> (<strong class="bold">OPA</strong>), the <a id="_idIndexMarker232"/><a id="_idIndexMarker233"/>scanning <a id="_idIndexMarker234"/><a id="_idIndexMarker235"/>of images, DevSecOps, BaseImage, and chain builds. We'll look <a id="_idIndexMarker236"/><a id="_idIndexMarker237"/>at some functional and non-functional testing. We'll explore operational <a id="_idIndexMarker238"/><a id="_idIndexMarker239"/>aspects such <a id="_idIndexMarker240"/><a id="_idIndexMarker241"/>as app chassis, image tagging, metadata <a id="_idIndexMarker242"/><a id="_idIndexMarker243"/>and labeling instrumentation, Knative <a id="_idIndexMarker244"/><a id="_idIndexMarker245"/>and serverless, and observability in terms of business versus app performance metrics. We'll <a id="_idIndexMarker246"/><a id="_idIndexMarker247"/>reference <a id="_idIndexMarker248"/><a id="_idIndexMarker249"/>Service Mesh and focus on operators for management and day 2 operation considerations.</p>&#13;
			<p>To show and not tell, we'll explore taking building and running from being what you see on the left to what you see on the right:</p>&#13;

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Section 7 — Improve It, Sustain It</h3>&#13;
			<p>As we come out of the delivery loop, we'll ask, Did we learn enough? Should we pivot or go round the delivery loop again? We'll see how we're entering a continuous learning cycle – not a one-time thing. Assumptions are proven or disproven during delivery loops. We explore the world of technical debt and how<a id="_idIndexMarker250"/><a id="_idIndexMarker251"/> we can bring qualitative and quantitative metrics <a id="_idIndexMarker252"/><a id="_idIndexMarker253"/>from the platform, the feature, and the app dev workflow to help radiate this. We'll seek how to take measurements and learning from delivery back into discovery artifacts, such <a id="_idIndexMarker254"/><a id="_idIndexMarker255"/>as event storms, metrics-based process maps, and user research. </p>&#13;
			<p>We'll learn how to blend everything covered in the discovery loop, the options pivot, the delivery loop, and the foundation to help sustain this way of working. This is what enables <a id="_idIndexMarker256"/><a id="_idIndexMarker257"/>double-loop learning for continuous discovery and continuous delivery. </p>&#13;
			<p>Long lived, cross-functional product teams learn to build it, run it, and own it. In this section, we'll look at some of the practices that help them sustain it. </p>&#13;
			<p>What role does leadership have to play in all of this? We'll show how to visualize the connection between leadership strategy, product development, and platform operations, all being driven by intent and informed by information and metrics. </p>&#13;
			<p>We'll explore approaches to scaling everything described in the book and how a culture of following principles is more important than pure religious use of practices.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>What about Distributed Teams?</h3>&#13;
			<p>When you look at the <a id="_idIndexMarker258"/><a id="_idIndexMarker259"/>photographs in the previous section, you may have noticed that the world that we’re moving towards involves people collaborating together. We are in the same space, around big white boards with lots of colourful sticky notes.</p>&#13;
			<p>A common question we receive from leaders, executives and <a id="_idIndexMarker260"/><a id="_idIndexMarker261"/>customers is how easy is it to apply these practices such as Event Storming or Social Contracting when people are not in the same location.</p>&#13;
			<p>During the last couple of decades, there has been a steady increase <a id="_idIndexMarker262"/><a id="_idIndexMarker263"/>in offshore and nearshore development <a id="_idIndexMarker264"/><a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>models. Some organisations have been restructured resulting in different parts of the organisation being located in certain areas of the world. In some situations, this has resulted in a more siloed organisation with larger walls between different parts of it due to geography, time zones and lack of face-to-face collaboration.</p>&#13;
			<p>Our answer to whether the people, process and technology practices we’re going to explore in this book can be used with distributed teams is <strong class="bold">yes, they can</strong>. </p>&#13;
			<p>However, the speed at which a distributed team will discover, deliver and learn is very unlikely to ever be as fast as the same team working together co-located. The <a id="_idIndexMarker266"/><a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>ability to learn and learn fast is foundational to the whole way of working. Therefore we always seek opportunities to find the fastest way to learn and remove bottlenecks that might slow down a team's learning. Working distributed in nearly all situations we’ve observed is a bottleneck.</p>&#13;
			<p>Until 2020, questions around whether use of these practices can be applied with distribution have been motivated by offshore teams, availability of skills and, ultimately, cost. Large System Integrators have<a id="_idIndexMarker268"/><a id="_idIndexMarker269"/> spent the 2000s investing billions in nearshore and offshore development centres so it’s understandable why they will want to do everything possible to enable teams in those centres to be able to use agile, lean and DevOps practices. For Agilistas, this can be frustrating as the focus of agile is very much on switching the conversation to be about value rather than cost and how to continuously learn and improve in order to optimise value.</p>&#13;
			<p>The year 2020 saw a new and significantly <a id="_idIndexMarker270"/><a id="_idIndexMarker271"/>enhanced motivation for distributed teams - the COVID-19 global pandemic. We were in the early stages of writing this book when the pandemic was declared and governments started talking about lockdowns and other severe restrictions. From March 2020, most if not all people reading this book will recall that their working and personal lives changed significantly. The vast majority of IT development and operations was suddenly performed from employees’ homes. The opportunity to co-locate for any kind of in-person collaboration was severely restricted by companies, by governments and, given health risk, was a detractor for individuals themselves.</p>&#13;
			<p>Like most, we had to pivot our own work and modify our own ways of working with our customers during the pandemic. Regardless of preference or prior thinking on distributed working, we now had to explore <a id="_idIndexMarker272"/><a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>and invest in distributed working practices. For us personally, this meant the launch of the <a id="_idIndexMarker274"/><a id="_idIndexMarker275"/>Open Innovation Labs Virtual Residency and other services to be provided remotely and distributed.</p>&#13;
			<p>When we released this <a id="_idIndexMarker276"/><a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>first section of this book as an early preview for feedback, we were strongly encouraged by our readers to explore distributed use of practices more than we were originally planning to. So, we will. In each of the sections of this book, we’ll include a section to share our experience of applying practices with distributed teams. This will include stories and experiences from the field during 2020 when we did this and the many learnings we got from doing so. Where relevant, we’ll also include details and <a id="_idIndexMarker278"/><a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>links to digital templates that have supported us. </p>&#13;
			<p>A note of caution. Just investing in a<a id="_idIndexMarker280"/><a id="_idIndexMarker281"/> tool like Mural or Miro and<a id="_idIndexMarker282"/><a id="_idIndexMarker283"/> having access to a bunch of templates will not<a id="_idIndexMarker284"/><a id="_idIndexMarker285"/> enable you to carry on as normal with all the practices and techniques you may have used in a room. We’ve already outlined the importance of getting the balance of people, process and technology change to get successful DevOps Culture and Practice. When switching to using distributed mode - teams need extra and continued focus on people, process, and technology.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Some Words about the World of 'Open'</h3>&#13;
			<p>The term open has been used several times in this book already and it will be used many times more. We work for an open organization, a company built on open source principles and characteristics. We're using the experiences <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/><a id="_idIndexMarker287"/>of Open Innovation Labs to tell many of our stories, and all the practices we're using are captured and will continue to evolve in the Open Practice Library.</p>&#13;

			<p>In this chapter, we introduced PetBattle and the backstory of the hobbyist app that will form our fun case study we'll use throughout this book.</p>&#13;
			<p>We also introduced how we'll regularly break out into real stories and examples from work we've done with our customers.</p>&#13;
			<p>Finally, we set out the remaining sections of the book and what we'll explore in each of those sections.</p>&#13;
			<p>Our introduction is complete. Let’s start working our way round the Mobius Loop and exploring our most used practices. Before we get onto the loop, we’re going to the foundation the loop will stand on. In the next chapter we’ll start by building the very important foundation of culture.</p>&#13;
