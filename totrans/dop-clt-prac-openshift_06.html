Before we get onto the loop, we're going to build a foundation for the loop to stand on. This is a foundation focused on building culture and technology: </p>

			<p>When you hear the word <strong class="bold">Foundation</strong>, what do you think of? A lot of people will think of the foundations of the building you are <a id="_idIndexMarker291"/><a id="_idIndexMarker292"/>currently sitting or standing in. As you know, you cannot just turn up and start building a house on top of some land. I mean, theoretically, you could. But not if you wanted something to stand the test of time and more importantly meet building regulations! First, you need to build a solid foundation. That means going beneath the surface of where you're going to build. The taller the building, the deeper and stronger the foundations need to be.</p>
			<p>When you think about it, this kind of applies to anything in life. When you lay a solid foundation, incrementally building on top of it has a much higher chance of success. Think about your education, your health, your fitness, your career, and your life. The successes you enjoy are because of the foundations and what you have been able to build on top of them.</p>
			<p>What happens when you build on top of a weak foundation? Well, generally, it's not good news:</p>

			<p>When working with organizations to build applications to run on <strong class="bold">OpenShift Container Platform</strong> (<strong class="bold">OCP</strong>), we see much greater success and return of business value when those organizations invest time and <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/><a id="_idIndexMarker294"/>expertise to build a foundation and a solid approach for their development and operations.  </p>
			<p>In <em class="italics">Section 1</em>, we introduced DevOps and some tools we're going to use throughout this book—namely the Mobius Loop and the Open Practice Library. The Mobius Loop acts as a navigator tool for<a id="_idIndexMarker295"/><a id="_idIndexMarker296"/> teams seeking to apply DevOps on a journey of continuous discovery and continuous delivery. The principles we've just discussed about needing a solid foundation before building anything also apply in the field of software design. We therefore added a foundation in our Open Practice Library. Before we even think about putting any teams, people, or products onto that Mobius Loop, we need to build a foundation. And not just a flimsy and minimal foundation – we need to build a rock-solid foundation. One that is going to support fast movement and an increasing number of folks jumping on the loop above it. What do we mean by a foundation? We mean a foundation of culture and technical practices:</p>

			<p>At Red Hat Open Innovation Labs, we<a id="_idIndexMarker297"/><a id="_idIndexMarker298"/> meticulously drive an outcomes-based delivery approach. The Mobius Loop acts as our navigator. It is a visualization tool that helps us to navigate, identify, and articulate the practices that we use at different points of our DevOps journey. </p>
			<p>When we are on the <strong class="bold">Discovery Loop</strong>, we <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/><a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>identify and use practices that help us answer the question of Why – why are we embarking on this journey? What problems are we trying to solve? Who are we trying to solve them for and what do we know about them? What is our great idea? We also use practices on the Discovery Loop to help us identify and set target measurable outcomes for the business and their customers.</p>
			<p>When we are at the <strong class="bold">Options Pivot</strong>, we use practices <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/><a id="_idIndexMarker302"/>to identify how we are going to achieve measurable outcomes. What are the ideas we have that we <a id="_idIndexMarker303"/><a id="_idIndexMarker304"/>could implement to help us get there? What are the hypotheses that have resulted from our discovery that we can test, run experiments on, and conduct research? How can we prioritize these options so we deliver value more quickly?</p>
			<p>When we are on the <strong class="bold">Delivery Loop</strong>, we are<a id="_idIndexMarker305"/><a id="_idIndexMarker306"/> using practices to do the work identified on the Options Pivot – implementing the features, running the experiments, and conducting the research. We crucially also use practices that allow us to take measurements and capture learning about the impact of our delivery. And, as we return back into the Options Pivot, we assess what we should do next based on those measurements and learning.</p>
			<p>The Mobius Loop is this infinite, continuous journey of continuous discovery, Options Pivots, and continuous delivery of measurable business outcomes that matter. We use practices on the Mobius Loop that typically have defined start and end points. The practices are designed to help a team advance around the loops – for example, in their Discovery process, to make their way to options and a decision point.</p>
			<p>When creating the Open Practice Library – a toolbox to store all of these practices – we found that many of them did not necessarily fit within the Discovery or Delivery Loops. Their nature was ongoing, or continuous. For example, we use many practices and techniques that help establish and drive a culture of collaboration. We use tools that help increase the energy, autonomy, and empowerment of product teams. We use practices that help drive an environment built on information radiation, transparency, and continuous learning. The concept of the <strong class="bold">Foundation</strong> beneath the Mobius Loop was added to explain these kinds of practices. These practices are designed to make it easy for teams to do the right thing by default. They are practices that we use to build a foundation of culture. There are also many technical practices that we use on an ongoing basis. The first instinct might be to associate these practices with delivery and argue that they should belong to the Delivery Loop. However, there is a subtle difference given that practices sitting on the Delivery Loop tend to be time-boxed, scheduled bursts of activity that help drive delivery. Practices such as Sprint Planning, Showcases, and user acceptance testing events (all of which we'll explore in detail in <em class="italics">Section 5, Deliver It</em>) tend to be scheduled at a particular time in the week or iteration. There are a host of practices that you would not schedule in the same way that you would, for example, a Sprint Planning session. These include practices such as continuous integration and continuous delivery, Infrastructure as Code or, in fact, Everything as Code, and practices around automation, such <a id="_idIndexMarker307"/><a id="_idIndexMarker308"/>as test automation. You don't do a couple of hours of continuous integration every Wednesday morning! You don't schedule a period <a id="_idIndexMarker309"/><a id="_idIndexMarker310"/>for Infrastructure as Code at the end of the week. These are things you do all the time, and doing them all the time is what makes them so powerful. The <strong class="bold">Foundation</strong> beneath<a id="_idIndexMarker311"/><a id="_idIndexMarker312"/> the Mobius Loop is also used to explain these kinds of practices – practices that help build a foundation of technical engineering excellence. </p>
			<p>Similarly, Discovery-type practices tend to be focused events run at a particular time, sometimes multiple times as teams do multiple iterations of the Discovery Loop. The practices that we'll examine in detail in <em class="italics">Section 3, Discover It</em>, are all executed by a group of people gathering to focus on that activity for a period of time. Practices more focused on generating culture, such as creating a team charter and social contract to define ways of working (which will be introduced in the next chapter, <em class="italics">Chapter 4, Open Culture</em>) do not sit on the Discovery Loop. This is because teams get the most value out of these practices when they use them all the time. They don't get their social contract out for half an hour on Monday morning and then never consider it until the next Monday morning! This is why we build them into the <strong class="bold">Foundation</strong>.  </p>
			<p>Now an important aspect of the Foundation and, in fact, the whole Open Practice Library, is that it does not prescribe or mandate any one practice over another. This is not another methodology or framework that spells out, in a prescriptive way, the tools and practices that someone or some team must use to achieve an outcome. We use the Mobius Loop and the Foundation to visualize the different practices we are choosing to use. There is no right answer to say how many practices you should use when building a foundation of culture and collaboration. </p>
			<p>We find that if you don't focus on or prioritize these practices at all, teams struggle to achieve outcomes, remain stuck in old ways of working, or fall back into the status quo when attempting change. Many organizations send their staff on a two-day Scrum training course and try to implement it by the book, only to struggle to see the impact of moving toward business agility. Scrum is primarily focused on the Delivery Loop and Options Pivot and organizations are not considering the cultural change or technical practices needed to sustain and promote the benefits that Scrum practices provide.</p>
			<p>In this section of the book, we will show you how to build an initial foundation of culture, collaboration, and the required technical practices, so that your house will stand for a very long time!</p>
			<p>You may have taken a peek at the Open Practice Library following its introduction in <em class="italics">Section 1, Practices Make Perfect</em>. If you applied the filter to look at all the foundation practices in the Open Practice Library, you will see that there are a lot! You may be wondering, <em class="italics">Do I need to use all those practices?</em></p>
			<p>The answer is no. The foundation of the Open Practice Library is a growing selection of tools and practices that will help grow an open culture. You don't need to use them all but you should start with at least a few. You may even have a few of your own! Ask yourself whether you are achieving an open culture and whether the tools you are using are working well for you.</p>
