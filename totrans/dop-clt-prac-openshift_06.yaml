- en: When you hear the word **Foundation**, what do you think of? A lot of people
    will think of the foundations of the building you are currently sitting or standing
    in. As you know, you cannot just turn up and start building a house on top of
    some land. I mean, theoretically, you could. But not if you wanted something to
    stand the test of time and more importantly meet building regulations! First,
    you need to build a solid foundation. That means going beneath the surface of
    where you're going to build. The taller the building, the deeper and stronger
    the foundations need to be.

- en: When you think about it, this kind of applies to anything in life. When you
    lay a solid foundation, incrementally building on top of it has a much higher
    chance of success. Think about your education, your health, your fitness, your
    career, and your life. The successes you enjoy are because of the foundations
    and what you have been able to build on top of them.

    Before we even think about putting any teams, people, or products onto that Mobius
    Loop, we need to build a foundation. And not just a flimsy and minimal foundation

- en: When creating the Open Practice Library – a toolbox to store all of these practices
    – we found that many of them did not necessarily fit within the Discovery or Delivery
    Loops. Their nature was ongoing, or continuous. For example, we use many practices
    and techniques that help establish and drive a culture of collaboration. We use
    tools that help increase the energy, autonomy, and empowerment of product teams.
    We use practices that help drive an environment built on information radiation,
    transparency, and continuous learning. The concept of the **Foundation** beneath
    the Mobius Loop was added to explain these kinds of practices. These practices
    are designed to make it easy for teams to do the right thing by default. They
    are practices that we use to build a foundation of culture. There are also many
    technical practices that we use on an ongoing basis. The first instinct might
    be to associate these practices with delivery and argue that they should belong
    to the Delivery Loop. However, there is a subtle difference given that practices
    sitting on the Delivery Loop tend to be time-boxed, scheduled bursts of activity
    that help drive delivery. Practices such as Sprint Planning, Showcases, and user
    acceptance testing events (all of which we'll explore in detail in *Section 5,
    Deliver It*) tend to be scheduled at a particular time in the week or iteration.
    There are a host of practices that you would not schedule in the same way that
    you would, for example, a Sprint Planning session. These include practices such
    as continuous integration and continuous delivery, Infrastructure as Code or,
    in fact, Everything as Code, and practices around automation, such as test automation.
    You don't do a couple of hours of continuous integration every Wednesday morning!
    You don't schedule a period for Infrastructure as Code at the end of the week.
    These are things you do all the time, and doing them all the time is what makes
    them so powerful. The **Foundation** beneath the Mobius Loop is also used to explain
    these kinds of practices – practices that help build a foundation of technical
    engineering excellence.

  zh: 在创建开放实践库（一个用于存储所有这些实践的工具箱）时，我们发现其中许多实践不一定适合放在发现或交付循环中。它们的性质是持续的，或是不断进行的。例如，我们使用了许多实践和技巧，帮助建立并推动协作文化。我们使用的工具可以帮助提升产品团队的能量、自主性和赋权感。我们还使用了一些实践，帮助营造一个基于信息传播、透明性和持续学习的环境。**基础**概念被添加到莫比乌斯循环下方，以解释这些类型的实践。这些实践旨在使团队能够默认地轻松做出正确的选择。它们是我们用来建立文化基础的实践。我们也有许多技术性实践，是我们持续使用的。最初的直觉可能是将这些实践与交付挂钩，认为它们应属于交付循环。然而，实际上存在一个微妙的区别，因为交付循环上的实践往往是有时间限制的、定期进行的活动，旨在推动交付。像冲刺规划、展示会、用户验收测试等实践（我们将在*第5节：交付它*中详细探讨）通常是在每周或每次迭代的特定时间安排的。而有些实践，你不会像安排冲刺规划会议那样进行时间安排。例如，持续集成和持续交付、基础设施即代码（或实际上是“一切皆代码”）以及自动化相关的实践，如测试自动化，你不会每周三早上做几个小时的持续集成！你也不会在每周末安排一段时间进行基础设施即代码的工作。这些事情是你随时都在做的，正是因为你一直在做它们，才使得它们如此强大。莫比乌斯循环下的**基础**也用于解释这些类型的实践——这些实践帮助建立技术工程卓越的基础。
- en: Similarly, Discovery-type practices tend to be focused events run at a particular
    time, sometimes multiple times as teams do multiple iterations of the Discovery
    Loop. The practices that we'll examine in detail in *Section 3, Discover It*,
    are all executed by a group of people gathering to focus on that activity for
    a period of time. Practices more focused on generating culture, such as creating
    a team charter and social contract to define ways of working (which will be introduced
    in the next chapter, *Chapter 4, Open Culture*) do not sit on the Discovery Loop.
    This is because teams get the most value out of these practices when they use
    them all the time. They don't get their social contract out for half an hour on
    Monday morning and then never consider it until the next Monday morning! This
    is why we build them into the **Foundation**.

- en: Now an important aspect of the Foundation and, in fact, the whole Open Practice
    Library, is that it does not prescribe or mandate any one practice over another.
    This is not another methodology or framework that spells out, in a prescriptive
    way, the tools and practices that someone or some team must use to achieve an
    outcome. We use the Mobius Loop and the Foundation to visualize the different

- en: We find that if you don't focus on or prioritize these practices at all, teams
    struggle to achieve outcomes, remain stuck in old ways of working, or fall back
    into the status quo when attempting change. Many organizations send their staff
    on a two-day Scrum training course and try to implement it by the book, only to
    struggle to see the impact of moving toward business agility. Scrum is primarily
    focused on the Delivery Loop and Options Pivot and organizations are not considering
    the cultural change or technical practices needed to sustain and promote the benefits
    that Scrum practices provide.
