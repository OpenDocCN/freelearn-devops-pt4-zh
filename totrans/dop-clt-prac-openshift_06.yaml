- en: When you hear the word **Foundation**, what do you think of? A lot of people
    will think of the foundations of the building you are currently sitting or standing
    in. As you know, you cannot just turn up and start building a house on top of
    some land. I mean, theoretically, you could. But not if you wanted something to
    stand the test of time and more importantly meet building regulations! First,
    you need to build a solid foundation. That means going beneath the surface of
    where you're going to build. The taller the building, the deeper and stronger
    the foundations need to be.

    lay a solid foundation, incrementally building on top of it has a much higher
    chance of success. Think about your education, your health, your fitness, your
    career, and your life. The successes you enjoy are because of the foundations
    and what you have been able to build on top of them.

    Container Platform** (**OCP**), we see much greater success and return of business
    value when those organizations invest time and expertise to build a foundation
    and a solid approach for their development and operations.

    this book—namely the Mobius Loop and the Open Practice Library. The Mobius Loop
    acts as a navigator tool for teams seeking to apply DevOps on a journey of continuous
    discovery and continuous delivery. The principles we''ve just discussed about
    needing a solid foundation before building anything also apply in the field of
    software design. We therefore added a foundation in our Open Practice Library.
    Before we even think about putting any teams, people, or products onto that Mobius
    Loop, we need to build a foundation. And not just a flimsy and minimal foundation
    – we need to build a rock-solid foundation. One that is going to support fast
    movement and an increasing number of folks jumping on the loop above it. What
    do we mean by a foundation? We mean a foundation of culture and technical practices:'

    approach. The Mobius Loop acts as our navigator. It is a visualization tool that
    helps us to navigate, identify, and articulate the practices that we use at different
    points of our DevOps journey.

    us answer the question of Why – why are we embarking on this journey? What problems
    are we trying to solve? Who are we trying to solve them for and what do we know
    about them? What is our great idea? We also use practices on the Discovery Loop
    to help us identify and set target measurable outcomes for the business and their
    customers.

    going to achieve measurable outcomes. What are the ideas we have that we could
    implement to help us get there? What are the hypotheses that have resulted from
    our discovery that we can test, run experiments on, and conduct research? How
    can we prioritize these options so we deliver value more quickly?

- en: When we are on the **Delivery Loop**, we are using practices to do the work
    identified on the Options Pivot – implementing the features, running the experiments,
    and conducting the research. We crucially also use practices that allow us to
    take measurements and capture learning about the impact of our delivery. And,
    as we return back into the Options Pivot, we assess what we should do next based
    on those measurements and learning.

- en: The Mobius Loop is this infinite, continuous journey of continuous discovery,
    Options Pivots, and continuous delivery of measurable business outcomes that matter.
    We use practices on the Mobius Loop that typically have defined start and end
    points. The practices are designed to help a team advance around the loops – for
    example, in their Discovery process, to make their way to options and a decision
    point.

- en: When creating the Open Practice Library – a toolbox to store all of these practices
    – we found that many of them did not necessarily fit within the Discovery or Delivery
    Loops. Their nature was ongoing, or continuous. For example, we use many practices
    and techniques that help establish and drive a culture of collaboration. We use
    tools that help increase the energy, autonomy, and empowerment of product teams.
    We use practices that help drive an environment built on information radiation,
    transparency, and continuous learning. The concept of the **Foundation** beneath
    the Mobius Loop was added to explain these kinds of practices. These practices
    are designed to make it easy for teams to do the right thing by default. They
    are practices that we use to build a foundation of culture. There are also many
    technical practices that we use on an ongoing basis. The first instinct might
    be to associate these practices with delivery and argue that they should belong
    to the Delivery Loop. However, there is a subtle difference given that practices
    sitting on the Delivery Loop tend to be time-boxed, scheduled bursts of activity
    that help drive delivery. Practices such as Sprint Planning, Showcases, and user
    acceptance testing events (all of which we'll explore in detail in *Section 5,
    Deliver It*) tend to be scheduled at a particular time in the week or iteration.
    There are a host of practices that you would not schedule in the same way that
    you would, for example, a Sprint Planning session. These include practices such
    as continuous integration and continuous delivery, Infrastructure as Code or,
    in fact, Everything as Code, and practices around automation, such as test automation.
    You don't do a couple of hours of continuous integration every Wednesday morning!
    You don't schedule a period for Infrastructure as Code at the end of the week.
    These are things you do all the time, and doing them all the time is what makes
    them so powerful. The **Foundation** beneath the Mobius Loop is also used to explain
    these kinds of practices – practices that help build a foundation of technical
    engineering excellence.

- en: Similarly, Discovery-type practices tend to be focused events run at a particular
    time, sometimes multiple times as teams do multiple iterations of the Discovery
    Loop. The practices that we'll examine in detail in *Section 3, Discover It*,
    are all executed by a group of people gathering to focus on that activity for
    a period of time. Practices more focused on generating culture, such as creating
    a team charter and social contract to define ways of working (which will be introduced
    in the next chapter, *Chapter 4, Open Culture*) do not sit on the Discovery Loop.
    This is because teams get the most value out of these practices when they use
    them all the time. They don't get their social contract out for half an hour on
    Monday morning and then never consider it until the next Monday morning! This
    is why we build them into the **Foundation**.

- en: Now an important aspect of the Foundation and, in fact, the whole Open Practice
    Library, is that it does not prescribe or mandate any one practice over another.
    This is not another methodology or framework that spells out, in a prescriptive
    way, the tools and practices that someone or some team must use to achieve an
    outcome. We use the Mobius Loop and the Foundation to visualize the different
    practices we are choosing to use. There is no right answer to say how many practices
    you should use when building a foundation of culture and collaboration.
  prefs: []

- en: We find that if you don't focus on or prioritize these practices at all, teams
    struggle to achieve outcomes, remain stuck in old ways of working, or fall back
    into the status quo when attempting change. Many organizations send their staff
    on a two-day Scrum training course and try to implement it by the book, only to
    struggle to see the impact of moving toward business agility. Scrum is primarily
    focused on the Delivery Loop and Options Pivot and organizations are not considering
    the cultural change or technical practices needed to sustain and promote the benefits
    that Scrum practices provide.

    in *Section 1, Practices Make Perfect*. If you applied the filter to look at all
    the foundation practices in the Open Practice Library, you will see that there
    are a lot! You may be wondering, *Do I need to use all those practices?*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The answer is no. The foundation of the Open Practice Library is a growing selection
    of tools and practices that will help grow an open culture. You don't need to
    use them all but you should start with at least a few. You may even have a few
    of your own! Ask yourself whether you are achieving an open culture and whether
    the tools you are using are working well for you.
