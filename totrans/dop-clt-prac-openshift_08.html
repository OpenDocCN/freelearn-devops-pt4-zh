			<p>In the previous chapter, we explored what it means to have an open culture and how we can enable teams to build this into their way of working from the ground up.</p>&#13;
			<p>When we talk about having empowered, self-organizing, self-directing teams, many enthusiasts will say that management is supposed to just get out of the way and disappear! Some will say if teams have true empowerment, surely they don't need to be managed and they don't need managers.</p>&#13;
			<p>Differentiating between leadership and management is important here. We want teams to manage the organization themselves from the bottom up and for leaders to set direction and intent that <a id="_idIndexMarker509"/><a id="_idIndexMarker510"/>enables that behavior throughout the organization. This is how open organizations such as Red Hat are led.</p>&#13;
			<p><em class="italics">Jim Whitehurst</em>, former CEO of Red Hat, defines an <a id="_idIndexMarker511"/><a id="_idIndexMarker512"/>open organization as <em class="italics">an organization that engages participative communities</em><em class="italics"><a id="_idIndexMarker513"/><a id="_idIndexMarker514"/></em><em class="italics"> both inside and out – responds to opportunities more quickly, has access to resources and talent outside the organization, and inspires, motivates, and empowers people at all levels to act with accountability</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>His diagram below <a id="_idIndexMarker515"/><a id="_idIndexMarker516"/>articulates the difference between conventional organizations that are managed <em class="italics">top down</em> and open organizations that are led and organized from the bottom up.</p>&#13;

			<p>So, what is leadership's main role in all of this? What can leadership do that helps deliver lasting change within a learning organization? We are going to tackle these questions by first taking a look at the Kodak case study, the company that invented personal photography but ultimately missed the digital revolution. What lessons can we learn from it? In the <em class="italics">Changing an organization</em> section, we'll discover that leadership can achieve far better execution by moving the decision-making to where the information is. We'll then learn how to use Priority sliders and forced ranking to help us prioritize where we can focus our efforts. In the final <em class="italics">The space</em> section, we'll take a look at creating the right physical environment for our teams to flourish within.</p>&#13;

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor102"/>The Kodak Problem</h2>&#13;
			<p>You don't have to be a CEO <a id="_idIndexMarker517"/><a id="_idIndexMarker518"/>or a business management consultant to understand that there are lessons everyone can learn just by sharing stories about different organizations and how they succeed or fail in a rapidly changing world. The lifespan of public companies has decreased markedly in the past 50 or so years.<span id="footnote-020-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-020">1</a></span> Why is this? History is littered with examples of organizations that have failed to adapt to changing customer needs. Let's take a look at possibly one of the most well-known of these stories in more detail and understand what went wrong.</p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker519"/>Eastman Kodak company invented personal photography. Up until the turn of the twentieth century, to take a photo, you had to go into a studio and have someone take your photo. Kodak sold this awesome user experience in a <em class="italics">box</em> for $1 – not a lot, really. The real money was to be made in processing the film to produce the pictures, which usually took a week or two. By the end of the twentieth century, Kodak had been hugely successful as a company and a brand.</p>&#13;
			<p>However, they missed a trick – by the turn of the twenty-first century, digital photography had started to take off. Kodak was there in digital, but they believed that photography was a <em class="italics">chemical process</em> thing – the money was made historically from chemically processing the film. By the time they realized the market had shifted, it was all too late for them. Rising tech giants in Japan and Asia were far better at making digital tech than they could ever be. Kodak filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2012.</p>&#13;
			<p>Did you know that a man named Steve Sasson was the inventor of the Charged Couple Device, which formed the basis of another invention of his – the digital camera. Guess what – he worked for Kodak! </p>&#13;
			<p>That's right. He invented the digital camera in 1975 and his bosses at the time buried it – they said no one would ever want to look at their photos on a television set. Steve also invented the first Digital Single Lens Camera in 1989, but again, at the time, Kodak marketing thought that releasing the product would interfere too much with their film processing business – so it was buried as well.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p style="text-align:center;">Figure 5.2: Digital Camera patent image from 1976</p>&#13;
			<p>Now, Kodak made<a id="_idIndexMarker520"/><a id="_idIndexMarker521"/> billions on their digital patents; however, these expired in 2007. The company just could not pivot fast enough to change the customer experience, which their competitors were delivering through digital, and eventually filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012.</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<div id="footnote-020" class="_idFootnote" epub:type="footnote">&#13;
				<p class="FootNote"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-020-backlink">1</a>	<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Destruction-Underperform-Market-Successfully/dp/038550134X">https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Destruction-Underperform-Market-Successfully/dp/038550134X</a></p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
						<p>This provides a fine example of the need for continuous learning, continuous measures, and a continuous appetite to pivot.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/>Learning from History</h2>&#13;
			<p>There are many lessons we can learn from the Kodak story:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li><p>Organizations must adapt to their changing customer needs.</p>&#13;
				<p>This is easier said than <a id="_idIndexMarker522"/><a id="_idIndexMarker523"/>done. Human understanding and cognition are heavily influenced by our cultural beliefs and upbringing. We just don't see what others see. In some ways, this is what happened at Kodak. Their background and company history were <a id="_idIndexMarker524"/><a id="_idIndexMarker525"/>from a chemical engineering viewpoint; indeed, Eastman Chemicals (which was spun off from Kodak) is still a very successful company today. At the time, Kodak's management was incapable of seeing the transformative change to the user experience that digital photography represented.</p>&#13;
				</li>&#13;
			<li>The Kodak story shows us that innovative change can come from anywhere within an organization.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>It often requires a different point of view from leadership for internal views to be promoted successfully as a business strategy. The old command and control structures themselves need to change so they are better able to encourage and embrace innovative change.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor104"/>Open Leadership</h2>&#13;
			<p><em class="italics">Shabnoor Shah, Open Leadership Global Lead and Coach for Open Innovation Labs</em>, explained to us how <a id="_idIndexMarker526"/><a id="_idIndexMarker527"/>Open Leadership is a new refreshing gaming-changing way of leading in a digitally transforming world. The foundations of leadership are rooted in the open-source way of thinking, working, and behaving.</p>&#13;
			<p>A unique aspect of <a id="_idIndexMarker528"/><a id="_idIndexMarker529"/>open leadership is that, because it is really a mindset and a way of being, it is not restricted to top levels of management in the hierarchy. Open Leadership can be practiced by anyone and at any level in the organization. However, when leaders lead openly, the impact is significant and palpable in shaping an open, positive, and progressive organizational culture. The results are reflected in employee happiness, well-being and engagement, customer satisfaction, and overall profitability and success of your organization.</p>&#13;
			<p>The guiding principles of Open leadership and <a id="_idIndexMarker530"/><a id="_idIndexMarker531"/>open organizations are transparency, inclusivity, collaboration, community and participation, adaptability, meritocracy, and releasing early and often. The overarching<a id="_idIndexMarker532"/><a id="_idIndexMarker533"/> belief of the open leadership mindset (at Red Hat) is to <em class="italics">default to open because open is a better way</em>. This is supported by four supporting beliefs that everyone has<a id="_idIndexMarker534"/><a id="_idIndexMarker535"/> something to contribute, everyone has untapped potential, everyone has the responsibility to lead and everyone benefits when we (all) put the organization first.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/>Changing an Organization</h2>&#13;
			<p>Organizational charts are usually drawn top-down in a hierarchy, and they tell you nothing about the nature of the company or its <a id="_idIndexMarker536"/><a id="_idIndexMarker537"/>interactions. Let's redraw our organizational chart to see if we can better represent the interactions that might be occurring. Our customers are drawn as our roots, the foundations that allow the whole organization to survive. Next, we have the different business units drawn as petals that interact using business processes to achieve their goals. The company president is a rain cloud who is downward-looking, shielding the organization from the external board and stakeholders, who are represented by the outward-looking face of the company, the CEO.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 5.3: Organizational charts rethought</p>&#13;
			<p>Humans are biological organisms. Organizations should also be treated like organisms rather than the product of their organizational chart. It makes sense – organizations are the product of the people they employ. So, when looking at how organizations change, we should ask the question <em class="italics">how does change occur with humans</em>? If the majority of people find change unsettling, what makes a person go through change rather than accepting the status quo?</p>&#13;
			<p>People make changes when they are insecure, unhappy, or unsatisfied with their current situation. Similarly, companies that are under stress are going to be forced to implement change to survive. It is insightful that when putting into action the practices described within this book, that it will feel <em class="italics">uncomfortable</em>. Often, team members will describe the changes as <em class="italics">hard</em> and <em class="italics">difficult</em> to make. This is actually a good thing! Change is hard. Companies (just like humans) need to embrace creativity to be innovative – so they can deliver<a id="_idIndexMarker538"/><a id="_idIndexMarker539"/> awesome experiences to their paying customers. A successful transformation isn't something that happens for only a focused period of time, with no changes happening after that. Embracing innovative change as a sustained way of operating is the challenge.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor106"/>Leading Sustainable Change</h2>&#13;
			<p>Change within an organization is not <a id="_idIndexMarker540"/><a id="_idIndexMarker541"/>sustainable without funding and executive sponsorship. Kodak failed to foster and action the great ideas that came from within. Within an organization, it is the organizational leaders that make the rules of the game that everyone else must follow. Importantly, leaders set the environment and the context that teams must operate within. This is akin to the <em class="italics">farming analogy</em>. To be a successful farmer, you must create an environment for your crops to grow. Organization leaders must create the right conditions to make innovative transformation flourish and become the norm. In a talk, we recently <a id="_idIndexMarker542"/><a id="_idIndexMarker543"/>heard <em class="italics">Simon Sinek</em>, a British-American author and inspirational speaker, say this – <em class="italics">There is one fact that is not disputable – your customers, stakeholders, and employees are all humans. You cannot lead a company. You can lead people</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>It is often unclear that leaders must take risks to change the current way of working. Often the risk is also a career risk for leadership. They are putting their job on the line to embrace the change. So, it is important that the first or initial scope of improvement decisions is made carefully. The change cannot be so big that it risks organizational failure, and must be meaningful so that customers and stakeholders feel a real business impact – your product gets <em class="italics">oohs</em> and <em class="italics">aahs</em> when it is delivered.</p>&#13;
			<p>Does any of this sound familiar in organizations you have worked in?</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>We have many unhappy silos within the organization.</li>&#13;
				<li>We are one team with many clans.</li>&#13;
				<li>There are too many hand-offs.</li>&#13;
				<li>There is too little accountability.</li>&#13;
				<li>We have misaligned incentives.</li>&#13;
				<li>We are punished for failures.</li>&#13;
				<li>We have people with egos who don't want to share.</li>&#13;
				<li>There are barriers to change – this is the way we have always done it.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>If you identified with any of these, they are<a id="_idIndexMarker544"/><a id="_idIndexMarker545"/> all traits and characteristics that require executive sponsorship to change. It is the leadership's role to:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>Create a shared purpose and vision.</li>&#13;
				<li>Give permission to <em class="italics">Change the Rules</em>.</li>&#13;
				<li>Remove unnecessary gatekeepers and roadblocks.</li>&#13;
				<li>Encourage actions that <em class="italics">Get Work Done</em>.</li>&#13;
				<li>Decentralize decision-making.</li>&#13;
				<li>Demonstrate transparent communication.</li>&#13;
				<li>Break down barriers between silos and departments.</li>&#13;
				<li>Measure the system as a whole.</li>&#13;
				<li>Make <em class="italics">Transformation</em> everyone's job.</li>&#13;
				<li>Value results based on delivering organizational outcomes over process adherence.</li>&#13;
				<li>Help build an engineering sanctuary where trust exists between the business and technology.</li>&#13;
				<li>Demonstrate results with metrics and data.</li>&#13;
				<li>Encourage teams to own the full engineering stack.</li>&#13;
				<li>Build transparency into the full development process.</li>&#13;
				<li>Take the risk to start the first transformational change.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>This is a long list. In the next section, we'll tackle three ways of bringing about these traits by taking some advice from a submarine captain!</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor107"/>Achieving Greatness</h2>&#13;
			<p>In Captain David Marquet's book, <em class="italics">Turn the Ship Around</em>,<span id="footnote-019-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-019">2</a></span> he defines leadership as <em class="italics">embedding the capacity for greatness in the people and practices of an organization, and decoupling it from the personality</em>.</p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-91">Giv<a id="_idTextAnchor108"/>ing Intent</h3>&#13;
			<p>In it, he talks about his experience of being a captain of a nuclear submarine and how they learned not to follow the leader into disastrous situations. He vowed never to give another direct order but, instead, to set intent. Rather than giving instructions, give intent. Officers stopped requesting permission all the time, which meant psychological ownership shifted towards them. Marquet talks about the two pillars that supported this idea of giving control – technical competence and organizational clarity.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-92"><a id="_idTextAnchor109"/>Moving Decisions to Where the Information Is</h3>&#13;
			<p>Moving the authority to make decisions to where the information is means, in the software space, software engineers can decide when to ship software and to do so when ready. The best time to make a decision is the last responsible moment before it must be made. By delaying, we are afforded the most opportunities to gather as much information as possible. By doing this, you get faster and better-quality execution of decisions than if central leadership were to make them.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-93">Set<a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>ting the Environment</h3>&#13;
			<p>This can be a huge mind shift to many but, when reading Marquet's book and watching the ten-minute <em class="italics">Greatness</em> video on YouTube<span id="footnote-018-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-018">3</a></span> (another video we love to show our customers and, in particular, their leadership), it makes a lot of sense. This mindset provides the leadership foundation for at least one team to work autonomously and with purpose. We'll explore the scalability of this mindset later in the book.</p>&#13;

			<p>If you are not in IT, it is fair to say that IT is often viewed as <em class="italics">getting in the way</em> of an organization's business goals. As <a id="_idIndexMarker550"/><a id="_idIndexMarker551"/>Steve, the CEO from the <em class="italics">Phoenix Project</em> book by Gene Kim<span id="footnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-017">4</a></span> says – <em class="italics">IT Matters. IT is not just a department that I can delegate away. IT is smack in the middle of every major company effort we have and it is critical to almost every aspect of daily operations.</em> Often it is the non-IT part of an organization that is the hardest to get on board with a new way of working that puts them front and center with the IT department to help drive outcomes of increasing customer success.</p>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>In the 90s, I was working at a software house, writing trading systems for banks in London. My partner was working at a traditional London law firm as part of the accounts team. She told me a story that I couldn't quite believe: there were NO computers in the company. All business was transacted on paper and B2B was still done by a fax machine. I was astounded that it was even possible to do business without IT!</p>&#13;
			<p>Can you think of any similar examples today? No, me neither.</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>A business product <a id="_idIndexMarker552"/><a id="_idIndexMarker553"/>owner and business SMEs are key people supporting our cross-functional teams. One of their key tasks is to represent and communicate with all of the product stakeholders and customers and share those conversations and outcomes with the team. By helping the team decide on what should, and more importantly should not, be delivered, the product owner vastly improves customer satisfaction because the software that represents the most customer value can be worked on and delivered first.</p>&#13;
			<p>By being part of the cross-functional team, product owners gain a shared understanding of the technical challenges involved in writing and operating the applications that deliver business services to their customers.</p>&#13;
			<p>Ultimately, it is through this collaboration and shared understanding between technical and non-technical team members that we get business leaders on board with IT. By successfully delivering customer and organizational outcomes, the product owner can show success to their management and in so doing, own the IT challenges with their technology counterparts.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now that leadership is enabling and supporting our product team's efforts, we are going to switch gears next and take a look at the practice of using priority sliders, which can help our team prioritize what product areas or team building topics are most important.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>Priority Sliders</h2>&#13;
			<p>Priority sliders are a great, simple tool to have in your kit bag! Like most of the practices we're exploring, they're really just a tool to help us facilitate a conversation and drive some shared understanding. We use them to drive team consensus in the direction we should go for a given time length.</p>&#13;
			<p>Running the practice is easy. Just get a small area of a whiteboard and do some brainstorming around key topics of focus <a id="_idIndexMarker554"/><a id="_idIndexMarker555"/>for your engagement. They could be things like:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Functional Completeness</strong>: How important is being 100% complete on some piece of app functionality, or are we looking for some sort of thin thread through all the functional areas?</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Security</strong>: We know security is important but how much time do we want to invest now in hardening our software?</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Skills Acquisition</strong>: Happy, motivated individuals make great teams. Making sure the team has all the expertise to build, operate, and own their software could be important.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">User Experience</strong>: Are we building what we want or what we think our customers want?</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Test Completeness</strong>: There will always be some testing. How important is it for us to automate this right now or should we focus on test automation from the beginning?</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>It is important to call out that these topics are not product features. They are product areas or team-building topics, without which we would not get a great product. For example, perhaps you want to drive more sales through your application so you decide to implement some form of push notifications to drive your customers directly to your app. Push notifications are not something you would add to your priority sliders, but perhaps market penetration could be. This topic could include a raft of additional features or experiments you could run. It's good to have a few examples of these ready and the team should always ensure they know what is meant by each item on the slider before you begin.</p>&#13;
			<p>With your list in place, get yourself some Post-Its and Sharpies and write them up in one column. For example, let's say we use the five headings from above. With five items, we now need a scale numbered from one to five for each one. The more items your team is prioritizing against, the higher your scale will go.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer107" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/B16297_05_04.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 5.5: Priority sliders</p>&#13;
			<p>With the scale in place, the team <a id="_idIndexMarker556"/><a id="_idIndexMarker557"/>needs to decide what they think is the most important item relative to the other items. The key with priority sliders is that no two items can take up the same priority – so if 5 is your top, then User Experience and Security cannot be on the same level. Each item must be traded off against another – hence some teams call this practice as using <em class="italics">trade-off sliders</em>.</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 5.6: Priority sliders – collaboration in action</p>&#13;
			<p>In the picture above, we can see a team discussing a priority sliders session in progress. Trying to figure out as a team how to force rank the options leads to a lot of great discussions. Below we can see two complete sets of sliders. It's important that everyone agrees on whether 1 or 10 is the highest importance!</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure">Figure 5.7: Priority sliders examples</p>&#13;
			<p>There are many ways <a id="_idIndexMarker558"/><a id="_idIndexMarker559"/>for a group to gain consensus – they could just have a good old-fashioned chat about each item and agree one by one as they go down the list. This can work well for some groups but for others, a more formal approach can ensure all people participate. Here are a few ideas:</p>&#13;

			<p>With the completed canvas, we can get a sense <a id="_idIndexMarker568"/><a id="_idIndexMarker569"/>of our upcoming priorities. These could be set for a few weeks or for longer but like all practices, this is not a one-time thing! It should be returned to once some work has been done in any given area on the canvas, checking whether it is enough and whether our priority has changed.</p>&#13;
			<p>Great product owners and scrum masters could take the priority sliders with them to sprint planning events. When deciding what to bring into sprint or what to omit, being able to shortcut those decisions by referring to the canvas can save time. Like all these practices, it's very important to keep them visual at all times and, of course, this is much easier when everyone can be in the same room. Of course, there are still excellent ways to run a priority sliders session with a distributed team, which we'll look at next.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>Running Priority Sliders with Distributed People</h3>&#13;
			<p>If you have a good digital whiteboard tool, and all stakeholders needed in the priority sliders are connected via a video conferencing tool, running the practice is relatively easy. We have provided a useful template that you can download from the book's GitHub repository and use in your tool of choice <a id="_idIndexMarker570"/><a id="_idIndexMarker571"/>such as Miro, Mural, PowerPoint, Google Slides, etc.</p>&#13;

			<p>When there are sliders on the wall <a id="_idIndexMarker572"/><a id="_idIndexMarker573"/>and everyone's on their feet and having to add their dot, the environment is so well set up for conversation and collaboration, people can't help themselves! On a video call, it's too easy for some folks to disappear and not get involved. So, really strong facilitation is needed. Adopting a liberating structure such as <strong class="bold">1-2-4-all</strong> will help get engagement from the outset. 1-2-4-all is a simple facilitation technique whereby individuals are first asked to independently and privately provide their input or opinion. They then pair up with one other person to discuss each of their ideas and merge them. Then two pairs group together to converge each of their ideas before the full group gathers together to bring all the input together.</p>&#13;

			<p>Re<a id="_idTextAnchor117"/>gardless of whether we are in a <a id="_idIndexMarker574"/><a id="_idIndexMarker575"/>physical or virtual working space, the practices introduced in this book so far (including priority sliders) all need a good space to be organized for the team to collaborate.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-98">Th<a id="_idTextAnchor118"/>e Space</h2>&#13;
			<p>One of the big focus <a id="_idIndexMarker576"/><a id="_idIndexMarker577"/>areas that can really help leaders establish a strong foundation for their team is in finding a suitable space for team members to work.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the previous chapter, we explored the importance of motivation and autonomy, mastery, and purpose. The physical working space is a great enabler. Great teams work in great spaces.</p>&#13;
			<p>When we <a id="_idIndexMarker578"/><a id="_idIndexMarker579"/>run our Open Innovation Labs residencies, we do them in one of our own physical labs, which was purpose-built for this type of working. It is often the number one concern our customers' residents have – they say their own buildings are not set up for this type of work and there will be many blockers put up by Facilities, Security, Health and Safety, and other departments. We aim to use the time in the labs to <em class="italics">show</em> leaders and stakeholders how much engagement, energy, and value is delivered from this way of working and how much the physical space enables it.</p>&#13;
			<p>We have some space recommendations based on a collection of best practices and lessons learned from real facilities built out of global, permanent Open Innovation Labs facilities, as well as experiences building temporary, <em class="italics">pop-up</em> team <a id="_idIndexMarker580"/><a id="_idIndexMarker581"/>spaces. <em class="italics">Val Yonchev, Open Innovation Labs EMEA Leader</em>, and <em class="italics">Mike Walker, Global Senior Director of Open Innovation Labs</em>, provided much of this thought leadership in their own contribution to the Open Practice Library, which you can read at <a href="http://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/team-spaces/">openpracticelibrary.com/practice/team-spaces/</a>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's look at a few examples. First, a lab <a id="_idIndexMarker582"/><a id="_idIndexMarker583"/>space such as that in the next picture is very open. There are no barriers or wall dividers. It is highly configurable with all the tables, chairs, monitors, and even plants on wheels!</p>&#13;

			<p>Just how much do we need to invest in the space and what is most important?</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>The Minimal Viable Space</h3>&#13;
			<p>A question we often get is do we <a id="_idIndexMarker588"/><a id="_idIndexMarker589"/>need to invest tens of thousands of dollars in a space and have all the things outlined in, for example, the Open Practice Library article in place before we can get our teams working in them? The answer is no. As much as we'd love all teams to have the perfect space, the reality is there are lots of barriers and challenges to getting there. Taking an agile approach to incrementally building out team spaces and applying <a id="_idIndexMarker590"/><a id="_idIndexMarker591"/>continuous improvement can work just as well and can involve the teams in their construction.</p>&#13;
			<p>The minimal viable space for a team is some open space without divides and some wall space. We've even got around wall space concerns with some of our customers by buying boxes of 25 foam boards (4ft by 8ft and 5mm thick). These are very portable and can stand against furniture, walls, windows, hang from ceilings on magnets, and so on. We like to call them portable walls!</p>&#13;
			<p>How have our customers reacted to the idea of bringing in huge foam boards? Let's look at a recent example.</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>I led a lab residency in a pop-up space in the offices of our customer, who was an international oil and gas customer. Understandably, security and health and safety were of utmost importance, and we realized getting custom furniture and movable boards was not going to be quickly approved.</p>&#13;
			<p>So, we took the approach of only having portable equipment. We brought in the foam boards mentioned above, several rolls of static magic whiteboard, boxes of sticky notes (which would only be stuck to our boards or magic whiteboard), and a projector.</p>&#13;
			<p>This meant we turned the space from this:</p>&#13;

			<p>After the four-week engagement, I got some feedback from <a id="_idIndexMarker592"/><a id="_idIndexMarker593"/>the now CIO. He said that Security watched the whole engagement with interest and moved from a mindset of saying <em class="italics">No, you can't do anything</em> to <em class="italics">we see what you want to do and why and we'll help you get there</em>.</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>You may be looking at the images and examples above and thinking it is impossible to have so many people in the same space at the same time. We often continue to probe such statements as we believe so strongly in the value of co-location and energetic workspaces full of <a id="_idIndexMarker594"/><a id="_idIndexMarker595"/>visualization and information radiation. Of course, with our recent experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, it really did become physically impossible for most of us and we've all pivoted to using virtual spaces.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>Virtual Spaces</h3>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter<a id="_idIndexMarker596"/><a id="_idIndexMarker597"/> and the previous chapter, we've looked at individual practices and given some thoughts and guidance on how to run them with people distributed. With virtual engagement and a distributed team, there usually is no physical space to consider. We are immediately challenged and have some risks in not creating the autonomy and psychologically safe space to facilitate great collaboration.</p>&#13;
			<p>There are two spaces we still need to consider and invest in:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>Firstly, each individual's space. In the previous chapter, we explained how we should <em class="italics">radiate everything</em> and, even in virtual settings, individuals need good spaces, multiple monitors, tablets they can use as build monitors, their own wall space, and so on. Investing time and money upfront to suitably equip each team member will set the overall team up for success.</li>&#13;
				<li>Secondly, there is the digital space. That tends to mean investment in solid tooling, of which there are a growing set of vendors who offer support. Our guidance is to think about all the practices and ways of working that work so well in the physical space and find a tool or set of tools that will allow the emulation of that exact same practice. So, if you use the burndown chart practice, find a way to do that digitally (such as JIRA<span id="footnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-016">5</a></span>). If you have a product backlog of index cards that everyone works from, find a tool that can manage that (such as Trello). If you regularly collaborate with people moving sticky notes around walls and annotating them, find a tool that enables that (such as Miro<span id="footnote-015-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-015">6</a></span> or Mural<span id="footnote-014-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-014">7</a></span>). Don't settle on one tool. Don't <a id="_idIndexMarker598"/><a id="_idIndexMarker599"/>decide on one upfront. Take an agile approach and encourage the experimentation and empowerment of the people actually using them.<div id="footnote-016" class="_idFootnote" epub:type="footnote"><p class="FootNote"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-016-backlink">5</a>	<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira</a></p>&#13;

			<p>Suddenly the <a id="_idIndexMarker600"/><a id="_idIndexMarker601"/>space looks like this:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure">Figure 5.17: Digital walls</p>&#13;
			<p>Yo<a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>u can see the differences between physical space and digital space and, if you have worked in both environments, you'll know the difference in feeling and energy. They are very different, and we've learned there are benefits to both of them. Whilst the virtual workspace does not provide the same culture, energy, and multi-dimensional visualization you can have in the 360 degrees around you, it does provide you with infinite space. You will not run out of wall space. There are environmental benefits to not using thousands of sticky notes. Inviting subject matter experts from the other side of the world to review and comment on your team's collaboration activity is suddenly a lot easier and cheaper. Your security and audit folks may also feel more assured by using these digital tools. It will be interesting to see, in coming years, whether the virtual and physical space co-exist, if one will become the norm, or if they will merge together into some kind of hybrid.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-102">Co<a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>nclusion</h2>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, we explored further what it means to be open with a particular focus on introducing open leadership and open spaces. The open culture practices introduced in <em class="italics">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italics">Open Culture</em>, help teams become autonomous and self-managing. Leadership has a role to play in creating an environment that facilitates and enables this way of working.</p>&#13;
			<p>We emphasized the importance of leadership setting intent when establishing a solid foundation for a team to base its product discovery and continuous delivery on. This is crucial for a DevOps culture to be successful. As we get further into this book to explore technical practices and how platforms such as OpenShift can deliver continuous business value, we need our teams to have a strong cultural foundation enabled and supported by an open leadership culture driving open organization behaviors from the top down. </p>&#13;
			<p>We looked at some examples of strong, open leadership – just-in-time decision-making, collaborative priority sliders, and their role in helping find the right workspace for the team, either physical or virtual.</p>&#13;
			<p>We explored some of our top recommendations to be considered in designing team spaces and also the minimal needs to start a team off with working with information radiation and in an open, collaborative space.</p>&#13;

In the next chapter, we will look at the other aspect of the foundation – technical practices and technical landscapes and what we do to establish a strong technical foundation prior to starting product development.</p>&#13;
