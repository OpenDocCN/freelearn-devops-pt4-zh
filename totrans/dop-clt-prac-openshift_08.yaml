    the twentieth century, to take a photo, you had to go into a studio and have someone
    take your photo. Kodak sold this awesome user experience in a *box* for $1 – not
    a lot, really. The real money was to be made in processing the film to produce
    the pictures, which usually took a week or two. By the end of the twentieth century,
    Kodak had been hugely successful as a company and a brand.

    photography had started to take off. Kodak was there in digital, but they believed
    that photography was a *chemical process* thing – the money was made historically
    from chemically processing the film. By the time they realized the market had
    shifted, it was all too late for them. Rising tech giants in Japan and Asia were
    far better at making digital tech than they could ever be. Kodak filed for Chapter
    11 bankruptcy in January 2012.

    at the time, Kodak marketing thought that releasing the product would interfere
    too much with their film processing business – so it was buried as well.

    directly to your app. Push notifications are not something you would add to your
    priority sliders, but perhaps market penetration could be. This topic could include

    add their dot, the environment is so well set up for conversation and collaboration,
    people can't help themselves! On a video call, it's too easy for some folks to
    disappear and not get involved. So, really strong facilitation is needed. Adopting
    a liberating structure such as **1-2-4-all** will help get engagement from the
    outset. 1-2-4-all is a simple facilitation technique whereby individuals are first
    asked to independently and privately provide their input or opinion. They then
    pair up with one other person to discuss each of their ideas and merge them. Then
    two pairs group together to converge each of their ideas before the full group
    gathers together to bring all the input together.

    physical labs, which was purpose-built for this type of working. It is often the
    number one concern our customers' residents have – they say their own buildings
    are not set up for this type of work and there will be many blockers put up by
    Facilities, Security, Health and Safety, and other departments. We aim to use
    the time in the labs to *show* leaders and stakeholders how much engagement, energy,
    and value is delivered from this way of working and how much the physical space
    enables it.

    in a space and have all the things outlined in, for example, the Open Practice
    Library article in place before we can get our teams working in them? The answer
    is no. As much as we'd love all teams to have the perfect space, the reality is
    there are lots of barriers and challenges to getting there. Taking an agile approach
    to incrementally building out team spaces and applying continuous improvement
    can work just as well and can involve the teams in their construction.

    wall space. We've even got around wall space concerns with some of our customers
    by buying boxes of 25 foam boards (4ft by 8ft and 5mm thick). These are very portable
    and can stand against furniture, walls, windows, hang from ceilings on magnets,
    and so on. We like to call them portable walls!

    energetic workspaces full of visualization and information radiation. Of course,
    with our recent experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, it really did become physically
    impossible for most of us and we've all pivoted to using virtual spaces.

    With virtual engagement and a distributed team, there usually is no physical space

    the autonomy and psychologically safe space to facilitate great collaboration.

    we should *radiate everything* and, even in virtual settings, individuals need
    good spaces, multiple monitors, tablets they can use as build monitors, their
    own wall space, and so on. Investing time and money upfront to suitably equip
    each team member will set the overall team up for success.

    tooling, of which there are a growing set of vendors who offer support. Our guidance
    is to think about all the practices and ways of working that work so well in the
    physical space and find a tool or set of tools that will allow the emulation of
    that exact same practice. So, if you use the burndown chart practice, find a way
    to do that digitally (such as JIRA[5](#footnote-016)). If you have a product backlog
    of index cards that everyone works from, find a tool that can manage that (such
    as Trello). If you regularly collaborate with people moving sticky notes around
    walls and annotating them, find a tool that enables that (such as Miro[6](#footnote-015)
    or Mural[7](#footnote-014)). Don't settle on one tool. Don't decide on one upfront.
    Take an agile approach and encourage the experimentation and empowerment of the
    people actually using them.

    you have worked in both environments, you'll know the difference in feeling and
    energy. They are very different, and we've learned there are benefits to both
    of them. Whilst the virtual workspace does not provide the same culture, energy,
    and multi-dimensional visualization you can have in the 360 degrees around you,
    it does provide you with infinite space. You will not run out of wall space. There
    are environmental benefits to not using thousands of sticky notes. Inviting subject
    matter experts from the other side of the world to review and comment on your
    team's collaboration activity is suddenly a lot easier and cheaper. Your security
    and audit folks may also feel more assured by using these digital tools. It will
    be interesting to see, in coming years, whether the virtual and physical space
    co-exist, if one will become the norm, or if they will merge together into some
    kind of hybrid.
