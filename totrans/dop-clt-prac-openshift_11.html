			<p>In <em class="italics">Section 2, Establishing the Foundation</em>, we built up the initial foundation for our first teams to work on. It consisted of a culture that enabled psychological safety and promoted autonomy, mastery, and purpose for team members. It also consisted of the technical foundation that <a id="_idIndexMarker1037"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1038"/>we bootstrap to enable teams to confidently start their application development, giving them the best chance of maintaining steady continuous delivery and not getting trapped by early technical debt. </p>
			<p>We’re now going to work our way around the Mobius Loop, starting with Discovery:</p>

			<p>In <em class="italics">Chapter 8, Discovering the Why and Who</em>, we’re going to explore how teams and stakeholders can collaboratively discover outcomes and understand the common purpose underpinning application development. To help navigate through this part of the process, we will be using the Discovery Loop of Mobius:</p>

			<p>When we are on the <strong class="bold">Discovery Loop</strong>, we identify and use practices that help us answer the question of Why – why are we embarking on this journey? What problems are we trying to solve? Who are <a id="_idIndexMarker1039"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1040"/>we trying to solve them for and what do we know about them? What is our great idea? We also use practices on the Discovery Loop to help us identify and set measurable target outcomes for the business and its customers. <em class="italics">Chapter 8, Discovering the Why and Who</em>, focuses on the upper portion of the loop, helping to answer the <strong class="bold">Why and Who</strong> questions.</p>
			<p>In <em class="italics">Chapter 9, Discovering the How</em>, we will shift the focus to practices that can help us start building a solution. Our approach to solving problems is incremental and experiment-driven. In particular, we focus on a group of practices that bring about a shared understanding through visualization and modeling techniques. No sticky note will be spared in this chapter!</p>
			<p><em class="italics">Chapter 10, Setting Outcomes</em>, will focus heavily on those outcomes, what they are, how we derive them, and how we use them. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to clearly articulate and define the team goals and outcomes being delivered. </p>
