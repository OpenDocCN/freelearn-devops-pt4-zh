    for our first teams to work on. It consisted of a culture that enabled psychological
    safety and promoted autonomy, mastery, and purpose for team members. It also consisted
    of the technical foundation that we bootstrap to enable teams to confidently start
    their application development, giving them the best chance of maintaining steady
    continuous delivery and not getting trapped by early technical debt.

- en: When we are on the **Discovery Loop**, we identify and use practices that help
    us answer the question of Why – why are we embarking on this journey? What problems
    are we trying to solve? Who are we trying to solve them for and what do we know
    about them? What is our great idea? We also use practices on the Discovery Loop
    to help us identify and set measurable target outcomes for the business and its
    customers. *Chapter 8, Discovering the Why and Who*, focuses on the upper portion
    of the loop, helping to answer the **Why and Who** questions.

    can help us start building a solution. Our approach to solving problems is incremental
    and experiment-driven. In particular, we focus on a group of practices that bring
    about a shared understanding through visualization and modeling techniques. No
    sticky note will be spared in this chapter!

    being delivered.'
