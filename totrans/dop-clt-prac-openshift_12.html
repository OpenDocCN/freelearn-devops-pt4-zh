			<p>Too often, software delivery teams dive straight into delivering features and focus purely on output and deliverables. They don't take sufficient time to understand what business problems they're trying to solve and the people they're trying to solve them for.</p>&#13;
			<p>There is often a split knowledge distribution of <a id="_idIndexMarker1041"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1042"/>business processes and domain knowledge that sits inside one person's head. The misalignment in knowledge across the team and between different stakeholder groups causes misguided decisions, misunderstandings, and incorrect assumptions to be made, with teams delivering the wrong solutions solving the wrong problems.</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure">Figure 8.1: The distribution of knowledge</p>&#13;
			<p>This is why we start with using a selection of <a id="_idIndexMarker1043"/>discovery practices in order to align all team members and stakeholders with a shared understanding of <em class="italics">why are we doing this? why are we investing time? why are we embarking on this and not something else?</em></p>&#13;
			<p>Furthermore, we explore what problems we are trying to solve and who we are trying to solve them for. Understanding these people, their pain points, and opportunities for improvement is crucial before we can start defining target outcomes for them. </p>&#13;
			<p>The Discovery practices we are going to explore in this chapter really benefit from a whole-team approach and being inclusive of all interested stakeholders. Gathering a wide range of views and encouraging engagement and collaboration across a broad group of people from different functional areas across the business helps to achieve alignment and a committed group of people who share the same understanding of the problems we're trying to solve. </p>&#13;
			<p>We intentionally wish to include both technical and non-technical people. Practices that facilitate conversation and alignment between more technical-focused people and less technical- or more business-focused people are particularly powerful.</p>&#13;
			<p>The use of discovery practices is not<a id="_idIndexMarker1044"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1045"/> intended to be exhaustive – we use these practices to get just enough information to align people, gain a shared understanding, and acquire enough confidence to go into the delivery of early experiments or other activities, which, in turn, drives more learning. This will not be the only opportunity to undertake discovery and use these practices – in fact, our goal is to regularly return and build on discovery using learning from delivery.</p>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">The North Star</strong>: A practice that helps achieve alignment on the Why and overall purpose.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Impact mapping</strong>: A practice that helps achieve alignment on the Who and the measurable impacts we would like to have on them.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Human-centered design</strong>: A group of practices<a id="_idIndexMarker1046"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1047"/> that helps develop empathy with the user and other important stakeholders.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>L<a id="_idTextAnchor191"/>et's take a look at our first discovery practice that helps align everyone to move in a single direction, the North Star.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-166">T<a id="_idTextAnchor192"/>he North Star</h2>&#13;
			<p>Creating a shared purpose for a <a id="_idIndexMarker1048"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1049"/>product can be achieved by setting a North Star. The North Star Framework is a model for managing products by identifying a single, crucial metric known as the North Star Metric.<span id="footnote-032-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-032">1</a></span> According to<a id="_idIndexMarker1050"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1051"/> Sean Ellis, who coined this term, this is <em class="italics">the single metric that best captures the core value that your product delivers to [its] customers</em>.</p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<p>Amplitude<span id="footnote-031-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-031">2</a></span> is a digital analytics company that has freely released an excellent playbook regarding the North Star Framework – what it is, why you might use it, and how to use it. It lists the following seven checklist points about <a id="_idIndexMarker1052"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1053"/>what a North Star Metric is:</p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li>It expresses value. We can see why it matters to customers. </li>&#13;
				<li>It represents vision and strategy. Our company's product and business strategy are reflected in it.</li>&#13;
				<li>It's a leading indicator of success. It predicts future results, rather than reflecting past results.</li>&#13;
				<li>It's actionable. We can take action to influence it. </li>&#13;
				<li>It's understandable. It's framed in plain language that non-technical partners can understand.</li>&#13;
				<li>It's measurable. We can instrument our products to track it.</li>&#13;
				<li>It's not a vanity metric. When it changes, we can be confident that the change is meaningful and valuable, rather than being something that doesn't actually predict long-term success, even if it makes the team feel good about itself.</li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;

			<p>The North Star Framework <a id="_idIndexMarker1054"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1055"/>complements Mobius very well. In the discovery loop (this section), we focus on defining the North Star and getting an aligned and shared understanding across stakeholder groups and team members as to why the North Star Metric has been chosen. In the next section, we'll be exploring the options pivot, which is all about the actionable research, experiments, and implementations we can perform to influence a North Star Metric. In <em class="italics">Section 5, Deliver it</em>, we'll explore the delivery loop, including the practices to measure and learn – our instruments for tracking a product's success against a North Star:</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 8.2: The North Star</p>&#13;
			<p>Using the North Star practice during a discovery loop can help set teams off in the right direction and achieve alignment between all its members and its stakeholders. It can also help teams achieve course correction or re-alignment if they've been running without a North Star. Having a North Star's information radiated on the wall and clearly in view of team members and interested stakeholders can help maintain focus on it and steer the team toward it.</p>&#13;
			<p>Many of the practices we<a id="_idIndexMarker1056"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1057"/> explained in the previous section to create a foundation of culture and collaboration will benefit the process of defining and using the North Star. For example, having a social contract and retrospective practices that help generate a team's autonomy and psychological safety in terms of contributing to strategically important information will help to promote wider group ownership of this metric. Having practices to <a id="_idIndexMarker1058"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1059"/>promote visualization of work will help share, inspect, and focus on reaching the North Star.</p>&#13;
			<p>So, the North Star is the first discovery practice that highlights the importance of needing a foundation of culture in place. Its effectiveness is much higher if an open culture exists, with people feeling psychologically safe to contribute and collaborate with each other. We will see this pattern continue.</p>&#13;
			<p>To help find a North Star, we make use of a simple canvas, such as the one provided in Amplitude's playbook:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer214" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/B16297_08_03.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 8.3: North Star playbook from Amplitude</p>&#13;
			<p>A team using the North Star Framework identifies a single, meaningful metric and a handful of contributing inputs. Product <a id="_idIndexMarker1060"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1061"/>teams work to influence those inputs, which, in turn, drive the metric. The North Star is a leading indicator of sustainable growth and acts as connective tissue between the product and the broader business.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's look at an example of a North Star Metric and how it was derived from inputs. OpenTable is a popular <a id="_idIndexMarker1062"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1063"/>platform for booking tables at restaurants. A recommended approach to discovering the different leading <a id="_idIndexMarker1064"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1065"/>inputs is to consider breadth, depth, and frequency; for example:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Breadth</strong>: How many users are being engaged? An example leading input indicator for this would be how many <strong class="bold">Monthly Active Users</strong> (<strong class="bold">MAUs</strong>) there are – users who at least performed a search on the site.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Depth</strong>: What level of engagements are users having? An example input indicator for this would be the booking conversion rate per session with a search.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Frequency</strong>: How often do users engage? An example input indicator for this would be the average time interval between user searches.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>These are all inputs we want to drive the improvement of in our product design decisions, but we require one metric, which is a crucial metric that represents the value of the product. OpenTable's North Star Metric is the number of seated covers per month – in other words, the number of times restaurant tables are used by paying customers each month. If this is high, we have a successful product driving good business. It is the one metric that does not lie and is the one we should be relentlessly focused on as being the indicator of success:</p>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 8.4: North Star canvas for OpenTable</p>&#13;
			<p>This canvas also <a id="_idIndexMarker1066"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1067"/>captures what the mid/long-term impacts to the business of the North Star Metric will be; in this case, a flat-rate fee taken for each seated cover booked generates revenue for OpenTable.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's go back to our PetBattle team and see how they went about finding their North Star Metric.</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-167" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor193"/>PetBattle as a Business </h2>&#13;
			<p>PetBattle was initially conceived as a fun idea to experiment with new technologies. However, due to cats being the internet's favorite time-waster, the site quickly went viral. As it was experimental, it wasn't built in the most robust or professional manner. This caused the site to crash due to the overwhelming number of visitors – a cataclysm of purrrfect disasters! Malicious users on the internet have been uploading inappropriate content to the site, which has to be removed manually as the site is intended to be family-friendly.</p>&#13;
			<p>So, the founders decided to try and monetize the site while still keeping to the simplistic approach of the initial creation.</p>&#13;
			<p>PetBattle's founders decided to embody the spirit of Dan Pink's book, Drive, when building up their cross-functional product team, so started off by building a cultural foundation. Each new team member adds their unique view, personality, and motives to the culture of PetBattle. In order to retain talent and enhance this great culture, PetBattle must make them feel like they can achieve autonomy, mastery, and purpose.</p>&#13;
			<p>PetBattle's employees need to feel connected to the vision of the product. They held a North Star workshop to connect all employees to the vision of their product and determine their North Star so that they can regularly inspect and measure against it.</p>&#13;
			<p>The workshop lasted for two hours and included the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>An opening discussion on the reasons for North Star</li>&#13;
				<li>Identifying the game PetBattle users would be playing </li>&#13;
				<li>A discussion on what makes a good (and bad) North Star</li>&#13;
				<li>A discussion on the structure of the North Star and its inputs</li>&#13;
				<li>Looking at North Star Metrics for other products </li>&#13;
				<li>Drafting PetBattle's North Star</li>&#13;
				</ul>&#13;
				<p>Amplitude has categorized digital products into one of three possible games. The Attention game focuses on how much time customers are willing to spend on a product. The Transaction game focuses on how many transactions customers make in the product. The Productivity game focuses on how efficiently and effectively a team member can get their work done. Following some discussion on whether PetBattle was more of an Attention game or a Transaction game, the group concluded on it being an Attention game. Ultimately, customers want to spend lots of time enjoying the PetBattle product and the aim is to keep them engaged.</p>&#13;
				<p>In collecting candidates for the PetBattle North Star, employees used a silent brainstorming technique first, and then paired up with one other person to discuss their ideas. Two pairs then formed a group of four people to merge their collective ideas. Finally, the full group converged all their ideas on a single wall. This facilitation approach is called 1-2-4-all and is a great example of a liberating structure .</p>&#13;
				<p>Candidate metrics for the North Star included the following:</p>&#13;
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>The number of site visitors</li>&#13;
				<li>The number of site visitors who have engaged (for example, at least placed one vote for a pet)</li>&#13;
				<li>The length of time spent on the site</li>&#13;
				<li>Increased follow-through to (eventual) advertisers</li>&#13;
				<li>The number of PetBattle competitions</li>&#13;
				<li>The number of pets uploaded to the site</li>&#13;
				<li>The site's drop-off rate</li>&#13;
				<li>The site's stickiness rate (the percentage of users returning three or more times in a month)</li>&#13;
				<li>The percentage using the mobile app</li>&#13;
				</ul>&#13;
				<p>During convergence of all employees' ideas, some great conversation started to materialize about what they really saw as success for PetBattle. Yes, they wanted more people to visit and yes, they eventually wanted advertising revenue, but the consensus seemed to be that the one crucial metric that was going to take PetBattle to the next level was the number of pet uploads. Most of the other metrics were inputs that could all help drive up the number of uploads. If there are more users, eventually more of them will engage. As more engage, eventually more will want to engage more and participate. The mid/long-term impact of participation would drive the impact of increasing the likelihood of advertising.</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>We can use a North Star Metric in both product and services organizations, as demonstrated by our <a id="_idIndexMarker1068"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1069"/>own use in Red Hat's Open Innovation Labs.</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
				&#13;
			<p>Open Innovation Labs is a professional services organization. We are often asked whether we can take a product mindset to a services organization.</p>&#13;
			<p>The answer is yes! We use all of the practices we talk about in this book on ourselves to grow a product mentality for our business.</p>&#13;
			&#13;
	&#13;
&#13;
			<p>This includes the North Star. I recall our team meeting when forming the concept of labs to consider what our North Star Metric might be. Our customers come from both the commercial and public sectors. Our overall vision is to unlock our customers' greatest possible potential by leveraging open technology, open processes, and open culture. Our <a id="_idIndexMarker1070"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1071"/>business value stream involves collaboration with lots of customers in a pre-sales capacity, understanding pain points and opportunities for optimization, and identifying suitable use cases that would be good candidates for our residency program. We hold sessions to qualify, discover, plan, engage, and deliver these services. All of these have their own metrics.</p>&#13;
			<p>Using a similar collaborative approach to that of the PetBattle story above, we arrived at a <em class="italics">number of qualified use cases for labs</em> as our North Star. It became clear (just like a North Star) that this is the crucial metric that we can use to assess the health of our business. When we have qualified a use case, we are very confident as regards our customer that our lab's residency program is the correct fit for their business problem. We have done sufficient discovery so that we collectively recognize the value it will deliver. We have high confidence in the engagement being sold and being delivered successfully.</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>Knowing, understanding, and aligning on your North Star provides an excellent basis to move to the next discovery practice, which explores the linkage of strategic goals to people, measurable impacts, and deliverables. This practice<a id="_idIndexMarker1072"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1073"/> is known as impact mapping. </p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-169"><a id="_idTextAnchor195"/>Impact Mapping</h2>&#13;
			<p>Impact mapping is a technique<a id="_idIndexMarker1074"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1075"/> that helps build shared understanding and alignment between leaders of organization strategy and product delivery teams. <em class="italics">Gojko Adzic</em> <a id="_idIndexMarker1076"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1077"/>first documented the technique in his 2011 brochure,<span id="footnote-030-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-030">3</a></span> which provides an excellent guide for people who want to facilitate the workshop. </p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<p>Adzic defines impact mapping as <em class="italics">a lightweight, collaborative planning technique for teams that want to make a big impact with software products. It is based on user interaction design, outcome driven planning and mind mapping. Impact maps help delivery teams and stakeholders visualize roadmaps, explain how deliverables connect to user needs, and communicate how user outcomes relate to higher level organizational goals</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>At the end of the impact mapping exercise, you should have:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>A shared understanding of the goal or problem statement.</li>&#13;
				<li>An inventory of human behavior changes in users and stakeholders that must occur (or not occur) in order for your project to be successful. These are the <em class="italics">impacts</em> from which the technique gets its name.</li>&#13;
				<li>Optionally, an inventory of project deliverables that could be delivered to achieve the aforementioned impacts.</li>&#13;
				<li>Some sort of prioritization of scope – one or more deliverables – and/or impacts.</li>&#13;
				<li>A graphic presenting the preceding information.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<div id="footnote-030" class="_idFootnote" epub:type="footnote">&#13;
				<p class="FootNote"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-030-backlink">3</a>	<a href="https://www.impactmapping.org/">https://www.impactmapping.org/</a></p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>Using this approach allows us to move to an experimental and hypothesis-driven model to feature development – one that quickly allows us to prove or disprove hypotheses. That is, we hypothesize that building a deliverable will achieve a measurable impact on a defined actor to help deliver a strategic goal. The learning associated with running these experiments to prove or disprove a hypothesis is what drives our continuous improvement to deliver outcomes that matter.</p>&#13;
			<p>Impact mapping<a id="_idIndexMarker1078"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1079"/> enables us to focus on business objectives and orient product teams toward delivering business value and not just delivering more and more features. It is a popular practice and one we use early on in most of our engagements because it provides a very simple human-centered discovery process. You don't need fancy tools or software to run it – some sticky notes, pens, an open space, and, most importantly, people are all you need. The resulting artifact is a graphical mind map of all the conversations.</p>&#13;
			<p>How do you do this? Well, start by reading Adzic's brochure. It is very easy to consume and will set you on your way. What follows is our experience of using impact mapping on a number of engagements. We'll break this down into the four components that make up an Impact Map:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">The goal</li>&#13;
				<li>The actors</li>&#13;
				<li>The impacts</li>&#13;
				<li>The deliverables</li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>For each of these components, we'll do a short overview and then look at our PetBattle case study to see how their Impact Map evolved.</p>&#13;
			<p>Building impact maps can be done with a group of <a id="_idIndexMarker1080"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1081"/>people co-located using a big wall space. It can also be done virtually using a collaborative tool such as Miro, Mural, Google Slides, or PowerPoint. We have provided a PDF of a template which may be useful to get you started. </p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer218" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 8.5 Impact Map digital template</p>&#13;
			<p>We'll then bring the Impact Map<a id="_idIndexMarker1082"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1083"/> together and show how we use it to form hypothesis statements that can be used to drive experiments.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-170"><a id="_idTextAnchor196"/>Start with the WHY — the Goal</h3>&#13;
			<p>At the very beginning of this<a id="_idIndexMarker1084"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1085"/> book, we said we always want to start with the Why. Why are we doing this? Why are we here? Collaborating over, aligning, and agreeing on the goal is doing this – starting with the Why.</p>&#13;
			<p>This first section of an Impact Map is often the hardest. The group of stakeholders and team members should frame the goal in terms of the company's measurable success and not a technical solution. As technologists, we often focus on the What without asking Why.</p>&#13;
			<p>By focusing our minds on why feature A is important, we can connect engineering practices and priorities to a company's success. Goals should be measurable so that we can quantify whether we are successful. The key output of setting a goal within a team is having a shared understanding and alignment on why we are setting out on an initiative.</p>&#13;
			<p>Goals could be<a id="_idIndexMarker1086"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1087"/> structured using<a id="_idIndexMarker1088"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1089"/> the <strong class="bold">SMART</strong> acronym:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer219" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/B16297_08_06.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 8.6: SMART goals</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Specific</strong>: A goal that is vague or can be misinterpreted has a lower chance of being accomplished.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Measurable</strong>: How do we know that we have accomplished the goal? It should be measurable.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Achievable</strong>: Can we realistically complete our goal; do we have the skills and things needed? </li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Realistic</strong>: Can we complete our goal given time and money restrictions?</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Time-based</strong>: How long does it take to complete our goal?</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Goal setting can be a difficult thing to agree upon. Often, there are competing views on what direction we are headed as an organization with the product or business area we are impact mapping. However, clarity of the goal for an organization can trickle down to all levels of a company, thereby creating a shared purpose for the individuals.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's look at the goal set by the PetBattle team.</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-171" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor197"/>PetBattle – the Goal</h2>&#13;
			<p>In our example PetBattle application, we are pivoting from a hobbyist application to one that can (hopefully) generate revenue. The team has split into two groups and, using a whiteboard, shared all their ideas and iterated over their proposed goal statement. The two groups came up with these goals:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Generate $100,000 in advertising revenue by the end of this year.</li>&#13;
				<li>Grow our active user base by a factor of 100 by the end of the third quarter.</li>&#13;
				</ol>&#13;
				<p>Following some discussion between the whole group, there was a consensus to use the first goal and, during discussions, they added some measures to it. So, in our PetBattle example, we have set our goal to: <em class="italics">Generate $100K revenue with our existing and new user base by the end of the year</em>. We can measure our goal against the current revenue, which is zero, or may even be negative if we include our current hosting costs. We are losing money as we speak!</p>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			&#13;
			<p>Setting a goal amongst a <a id="_idIndexMarker1090"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1091"/>small group can be straightforward. What about larger groups? Let's look at some anti-patterns and tips for gaining consensus and inclusivity.</p>&#13;

			<p class="callout">When undertaking any group activity, often the person who shouts loudest is the one who's listened to the most. Sometimes, the most senior person in the room is given the most airtime in discussions – this is known as the <strong class="bold">Highest Paid Person's Opinion</strong> (<strong class="bold">HIPPO</strong>) effect. This leads to one-sided views being portrayed as the norm and makes people who are quiet or shy often feel unheard. If you're beginning to write your goal, a good method to get everyone's voice heard is Liberating Structures' 1-2-4-all practice (<a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/">http://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/</a>). It's a simple practice to use, but immensely powerful. Start by setting a one-to-two-minute timer and having each individual in the group write down what they think their business goal is. Next, pair up and give another two minutes to the groups to agree on a shared goal between the pairs. Now repeat in groups of four, before finally coming together as a whole, focusing on just one goal:</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure">Figure 8.7: 1-2-4-all Liberating Structures</p>&#13;
			<p>When all the members in the team align on a goal, it can be very helpful to write it up on a large board or flipchart paper. Having something that everyone can nod their head to and agree <em class="italics">this is why we are here, this is our Why, this is our shared purpose</em> makes a very powerful <a id="_idIndexMarker1092"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1093"/>information radiator. Let's remind ourselves of PetBattle's goal on a big sticky note:</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 8.8: Goal from the Impact Map</p>&#13;
			<p>Th<a id="_idTextAnchor198"/>e next part of the impact mapping process is to consider Who can help us reach our goal.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-172"><a id="_idTextAnchor199"/>WHO Can Help Us Reach the Desired Effect? The Actors</h3>&#13;
			<p>As a group, we identify all the people or groups <a id="_idIndexMarker1094"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1095"/>of people who can help us to achieve our goal. This includes the people who will interact with our new application, either directly or indirectly.</p>&#13;
			<p>This is a great opportunity to use a diverge/converge approach to identifying new actors. We can <a id="_idIndexMarker1096"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1097"/>create a number of possible ideas (divergent thinking) before refining and narrowing down to the best idea (convergent thinking). We can focus on the people who can help or hinder us in achieving our goal (divergent thinking) and then focus on a few high-value or key actors (convergent thinking). Deciding on which actors are high-value can be a bit of an informed guess, but that's OK; we are <a id="_idIndexMarker1098"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1099"/>placing bets on who can help us reach the desired effect.</p>&#13;
			<p>Actors can be more than just user groups. They may be a combination of specific types of behavior, for example, extroverts or <a id="_idIndexMarker1100"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1101"/>late-night shoppers.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's look at the actors in PetBattle.</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-173" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor200"/>PetBattle – the Actors</h2>&#13;
			<p>After some brainstorming and divergent thinking, the group came up with the following list of actors:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Uploaders</strong>: These are players of our PetBattle game. They contribute new images of cats and go head-to-head with other players and random cats downloaded from the internet.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Animal lovers</strong>: This group of people is fond of cats, cute games, and has time to spend on our site. They play the game by voting, but do not submit their cat photos for battle.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Casual Viewers</strong>: These are people who stumble onto our site and represent a group of people we would like to turn into return visitors.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Advertisers</strong>: The pet food, toys, and accessory companies who could stand to gain from our active user base.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Families</strong>: Groups of parents and children who play on the site and potentially create content too.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The Impact Map starts to take shape by visualizing and connecting these actors to the goal. These<a id="_idIndexMarker1102"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1103"/> groups of people are the stakeholders and interested parties who will help us to achieve our goal:</p>&#13;
<div id="_idContainer222" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="../Images/B16297_08_09.jpg" alt=""/></div>&#13;
			<p>Figure 8.9: Goal and actors</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>We have now visualized the <a id="_idIndexMarker1104"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1105"/>connection between the goal and all the actors that can achieve or impede it.</p>&#13;
			<h4>Note </h4>&#13;
			<p class="callout">The founders of PetBattle struggled when defining the initial set of actors and mistakenly broke the group into authenticated and non-authenticated user groups without tying it back to the goal and the problem statement. This is a classic example of trying to engineer a solution too early without identifying why these classifications exist. Identifying the boundaries between groups is very useful. Sometimes, you can have coarse groups. By splitting them out, you may find additional impacts that are only applicable to those sub-groups.</p>&#13;
			<p>One of the greatest benefits we see to the impact mapping exercise is all the conversation and shared understanding it generates. When naming actor groups, we find that different people can have different understandings or terms they use. In the preceding example, we may get a short conversation to differentiate between a <strong class="bold">casual viewer</strong> and an <strong class="bold">uploader</strong>. Some people may have just called these generic users. Having ubiquitous language from the outset can really help with the software development process. This is true for teams that focus on both the technical and business aspects of the product. Already, we are seeing the need to differentiate between different user groups in our software design.</p>&#13;
			<p>The next stage is<a id="_idIndexMarker1106"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1107"/> arguably the most important and key to the impact mapping practice – defining the measurable impacts we plan to have on each of the actor groups.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-174"><a id="_idTextAnchor201"/>HOW Should Our Actors’ Behaviors Change? The Impacts</h3>&#13;
			<p>What is the <a id="_idIndexMarker1108"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1109"/>measurable change in behavior our <a id="_idIndexMarker1110"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1111"/>actors need to exhibit to help drive our business results? What do we want our actors to start or stop doing that can take us to our goal?</p>&#13;
			<p>What could hinder us from achieving the goal?</p>&#13;
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor202"/>Let's look at the impacts considered for PetBattle.</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-175" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor203"/>PetBattle – the Impacts</h2>&#13;
			<p>For PetBattle, the team spent 30 minutes brainstorming all the impacts. It's ideal if they are measurable. The team came up with several impacts for each of the identified actors:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Uploaders:</strong> Increase site engagement and increase the sharing of wins with social networks.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Animal lovers</strong><strong class="bold">:</strong> We want to enhance ease of access to the site. </li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Advertisers:</strong> Increase the desirability of the site to advertisers and increase the number of sponsored competitions.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Families:</strong> Decrease site misuse (inappropriate content).</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Moving to the graphical Impact Map, we can visualize the impacts we want to have on each actor to help achieve the goal:</p>&#13;
			<div id="_idContainer223" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;
			<img src="../Images/B16297_08_10.jpg" alt=""/></div>&#13;
			<p>Figure 8.10: Goal, actors, and impacts</p>&#13;
			<p>Occasionally, you may discover an impact that applies to more than one actor group. For example, in PetBattle, an overarching impact for both animal lovers, uploaders, and casual viewers is to increase the follow-through to our advertisers' websites.</p>&#13;
			<p>An impact that spans many actors could be a good place to place a bet as you can have a greater impact across your groups with potentially less effort. It should be <a id="_idIndexMarker1112"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1113"/>noted that the deliverables for this impact could differ for each actor.</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>We have now <a id="_idIndexMarker1114"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1115"/>visualized the connection between the goal, all the actors that can achieve or impede it and the measurable impact we want to have on those actors.</p>&#13;
			<h4>Note </h4>&#13;
			<p class="callout">Always start an impact statement with the term <strong class="bold">Increase</strong> or <strong class="bold">Decrease</strong> (or <strong class="bold">Reduce</strong>). By doing this, we avoid accidentally slipping into the territory of capturing features or outputs when we want to focus on behavioral change on the actors. It also means the impact should be measurable. By thinking about how we want to increase or decrease something, we are quantifying it. We could apply a measure to the impact now (even an arbitrary measure) and come back in the future to see whether that impact has moved up or down.</p>&#13;
			<p>With the goals<a id="_idIndexMarker1116"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1117"/> and impacts defined, we are coming close to the aspects we are often most comfortable with – the deliverables. The deliverables could be features or groups of features where a feature is a slice of the functionality of the application. What are the tangible things we could do to create this impact? The temptation is to jump straight to features, but by describing impacts as a measurable change in human behavior, we are forced to ask why <em class="italics">feature X</em> is important and relate it back to our business goal.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's now look at the deliverables considered for PetBattle.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-176"><a id="_idTextAnchor204"/>WHAT Should We Build? The Deliverables</h3>&#13;
			<p>What are the things we <a id="_idIndexMarker1118"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1119"/>think we could build that would produce the desired impact for a given actor/set of actors? This is where all the things we'd like to implement can be added to the mind map and, more critically, tied back to the business value driving this feature.</p>&#13;
			<p>This part of the Impact Map is not really the focus of this particular practice and we've seen teams not complete this part. Impact mapping is all about capturing the impacts on actor groups through conversation and collaboration so that we can start to measure what <a id="_idIndexMarker1120"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1121"/>matters. We have other practices that we'll explore later in this chapter that are better at defining the <a id="_idIndexMarker1122"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1123"/>outputs and deliverables. That said, it's virtually impossible not to think about what you might build to achieve these impacts, so it's good to capture them during the conversation.</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-177" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor205"/>PetBattle – the Deliverables</h2>&#13;
			<p>From the outset, the PetBattle team were full of ideas on stuff they could do to build the PetBattle app and group the PetBattle business. They'd been written on sticky notes and placed on a <em class="italics">feature ideas</em> board. They included:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>Social media sharing links</li>&#13;
				<li>A loyalty scheme</li>&#13;
				<li>A scoreboard for players</li>&#13;
				<li>Different animal filters</li>&#13;
				<li>A daily tournament</li>&#13;
				<li>Discounts for sponsors</li>&#13;
				<li>Printing postcards from the site</li>&#13;
				<li>Search engine optimization</li>&#13;
				<li>Click counting and tracking</li>&#13;
				<li>Cross-platform</li>&#13;
				<li>A new cat battle notice</li>&#13;
				<li>Incentives, charity donations</li>&#13;
				<li>Breaking out into non-feline-based battles</li>&#13;
				<li>Social logins</li>&#13;
				<li>Personalization</li>&#13;
				<li>Targeting advertising</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>…and many more!</p>&#13;
			<p>Lots of great ideas for features. But can we connect them to having a measurable impact that will drive the overall goal? That's what this part of the impact mapping process will help us to achieve.</p>&#13;
			<p>Where we can identify an impact that we believe will trigger a defined impact, we place the deliverable and impact next to each other on the Impact Map. For example, the group thought having a daily tournament may well increase site engagement:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer224" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/B16297_08_11.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>Figure 8.11: First full impact statement</p>&#13;
			<p>We can translate this to a hypothesis statement:</p>&#13;
			<p><em class="italics">We hypothesize that if we run a daily tournament, it would increase the site engagement for our uploaders. This, in turn, would help us achieve our goal of growing our user base and raising $100K in revenue</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>A second hypothesis statement is generated from the idea of allowing additional advertising space for competition sponsors:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer225" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/B16297_08_12.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>Figure 8.12: Second full impact statement</p>&#13;
			<p><em class="italics">If we provide premium advertising space, we could increase the number of sponsored tournaments and turn advertisers into sponsors, thereby helping us to generate $100K in revenue</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Some features could not be connected to an impact statement and the team could not think of one. They therefore decided to de-prioritize the idea given there was not a traceable benefit.</p>&#13;
			<p>The resulting Impact Map was big. It was full of ideas for deliverables all lined up to anticipated measurable impacts:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer226" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/B16297_08_13.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;

			<p>Figure 8.13: The PetBattle Impact Map</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>Our Impact Map is <a id="_idIndexMarker1124"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1125"/>complete. It connects the <strong class="bold">deliverables</strong> (the <strong class="bold">What</strong>) to the <strong class="bold">impacts</strong> (the <strong class="bold">How</strong>) on the<a id="_idIndexMarker1126"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1127"/> <strong class="bold">actors</strong> (the <strong class="bold">Who</strong>), helping to achieve the overall <strong class="bold">goal</strong> (the <strong class="bold">Why</strong>):</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer227" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/B16297_08_14.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 8.14: Impact Map summary</p>&#13;
			<p>At this point, we can start to think about some prioritization – at least among the stakeholders who participated in the practice. Using the impact mapping practice, we have come up with a set of hypothesis statements. We don't know whether those statements will turn out to be true. They're just intelligent guesses at this point. To prove or disprove hypotheses, we need to run experiments. Each hypothesis statement can be turned into an experiment. But which experiment do we run first and what order do we run them in?</p>&#13;
			<p>Time to place your bets! An interesting way to approach this is to ask stakeholders where they want to place their bets. To simulate this, we can give each stakeholder some fake money. $10,000 Beattie Bucks or $10,000 Donal Dollars or $10,000 Mike Money. (Noel, the fourth author, decided he didn't want to enter the currency market!) This is a simple practice to simulate what it would be like if each person in the room was the owner of the company and it was their money.</p>&#13;
			<p>Attendees of the session now place a bet with their fake money. They bet on which impact statement they would like to invest in an experiment first. They may choose to invest in just one<a id="_idIndexMarker1128"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1129"/> impact or spread their bet across multiple impacts. This allows everyone to pick their top-priority deliverables, showing an aggregated view of what the team should focus on building first.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's look into an example to <a id="_idIndexMarker1130"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1131"/>understand this better:</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-178" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor206"/>PetBattle – Placing Bets</h2>&#13;
			<p>Each of the four stakeholders investing in PetBattle was given five Donal Dollars and asked to look at the Impact Map:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer228" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/B16297_08_15.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>Figure 8.15: Donal Dollars</p>&#13;
			<p>They were asked which impact statements they would like to invest in and were encouraged either to spread their money across different impacts or place multiple Donal Dollars on one impact if that was deemed of very high value to them.</p>&#13;
			<p>Some stakeholders chose to invest all their Donal Dollars on just one impact, while others spread them out. The Impact Map, with Donal Dollars attached, showed a clear winner:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer229" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/B16297_08_16.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>Figure 8.16: Donal Dollars – Impact Map</p>&#13;
			<p>It was clear that the investing stakeholders wanted to invest in increasing site engagement. The Impact Map <a id="_idIndexMarker1132"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1133"/>already had seven deliverables associated with this, so the team was ready to run some experiments to prove or disprove the associated hypothesis statements.</p>&#13;
			<p>The stakeholders looked forward to coming back to this Impact Map to see whether their investment had paid off (and maybe spend some more Donal Dollars!)</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>In the next section of the book, <em class="italics">Section 4, Prioritize it</em>, we'll look at how we prioritize all the learning and outputs from the practices we used on the Discovery Loop. One of the viewpoints will be the outcome of investment betting on the Impact Map.</p>&#13;
			<p>A final point before we share a couple of real-world stories about impact mapping is to mention the<a id="_idIndexMarker1134"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1135"/> fact that the Impact Map is never complete. It is not static. It is not a one-time thing. It will always evolve. Teams should regularly come back to their Impact Map after they deliver some features, run some experiments, and learn from their users. They should converse on the results of experiments and conclude whether existing hypotheses statements were proven or disproven.</p>&#13;
			<p>We introduced psychological safety in the previous section. A helpful test of the current psychological culture is to inspect what happens when a hypothesis statement from an Impact Map turns out to be wrong. A failed hypothesis could impact team morale and result in a lack of psychological safety. If the hypothesis succeeded and created room for further learning and improvisation, it could boost morale and establish an open culture in the team.</p>&#13;

			<p>Let's see how we used impact mapping at our Open Innovation Labs residency to help a global bank that was seeking to improve its HR system.</p>&#13;
			<p>The business goal was for HR to have an integrated workflow across HR systems, providing an improved colleague experience. Some metrics were identified at the goal level, including colleague satisfaction and the time to change a service lead.</p>&#13;
			<p>The brainstorming of actors identified colleagues, which the group agreed would be the ubiquitous term they would use for all employees, managers, second line managers, partners, and HR operations, as well as management and technology stakeholders.</p>&#13;
			<p>Measurable impact statements and possible deliverables were identified for each actor group, leading to a number of powerful hypothesis statements, including the following:</p>&#13;
			<p>We hypothesize that delivering a single sign-on solution will speed up the service, thereby helping colleagues and managers achieve the above goal.</p>&#13;
			<p>We hypothesize that integrating with a data hub will increase the quality of colleague data available to HR operators, thereby helping to achieve the above goal.</p>&#13;
			<p>We hypothesize that developing custom dashboard features will increase insights into the management information group.</p>&#13;
			<p>We hypothesize that designing a new governance model will help the HR specialist speed up the remodeling process.</p>&#13;
			<p>This is a great example for demonstrating how impact mapping can help drive much larger enterprise systems (well beyond standalone applications) and can also identify outputs beyond software (for example, the governance model is an organizational feature).</p>&#13;
			<p>Here is part of the Impact Map:</p>&#13;

			<p>One of my favorite moments of impact mapping came several weeks after the original Impact Map was produced.</p>&#13;
			<p>Working with a<a id="_idIndexMarker1138"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1139"/> European automotive company to help re-imagine and kick-start the development of their technical support knowledge management system, we used impact mapping to start discovery.</p>&#13;
			<p>Following three sprints of development, our sprint retrospective led the team to take some actions for the next sprint. The team decided it would be worth re-exploring the Impact Map now that they had done three iterations of development, as we had an app that was being tested with end users.</p>&#13;
			<p>We brought the big portable board out onto the balcony of the venue we were running the residency from. It was quite a windy day and one lesson I took away was not to bring boards of sticky notes outside when there's a bit of wind!</p>&#13;
			<p>The proud moment is from the following photo, where an engineer was leading the conversation about a feature he had developed. He was assessing whether the expected impact had been achieved and what they had collectively learned:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer233" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p>Figure 8.18: Revisiting the Impact Map</p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<p>I thought about the many development teams I'd worked with. It was refreshing to see technical staff so connected with the Why. They were engaged in ensuring that their outputs were delivering measurable outcomes.</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			&#13;

			<p>Impact mapping is, without doubt, one of the best practices to start your discovery conversations. What else could we do to enhance this? We're now going to focus on the actors' perspective, in other words, what the product could do for them, using Human-centered design.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-181"><a id="_idTextAnchor209"/>Human-Centered Design</h2>&#13;
			<p>Impact mapping identified all the different actors and groups of people that can help achieve our goal. It also identified the measurable impacts we would like to have on them. Wouldn't it be great if <a id="_idIndexMarker1142"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1143"/>we could actually meet and engage with some of these people? We could validate our Impact Map with them. We could check whether the deliverables we have in mind would be supported by them. We could learn from them before we write a line of code! We could build a trusted relationship with them whereby we regularly check in with them, test, measure, and learn from them as we start to build out applications.</p>&#13;
			<p>Human-centered design is an approach to system development that aims to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs, and requirements.</p>&#13;
			<p>There are several major topics that relate to <strong class="bold">User Experience</strong> (<strong class="bold">UX</strong>). Each of these is large enough to fill books of their own and include:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>Design thinking</li>&#13;
				<li>Human-centered design</li>&#13;
				<li>The Double Diamond process model</li>&#13;
				<li>Lean UX</li>&#13;

			<p>In the software <a id="_idIndexMarker1144"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1145"/>development world, we can start with people and end up with innovative applications that are tailor-made to suit our users' needs. By understanding our users and looking at things from their perspective, we can ultimately produce a product that they will love to use and engage with.</p>&#13;
			<p>People react to what they see – visual design. However, there are many layers below the visual that UX designers must consider in order to make an application engaging and useful:</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 8.19: The UX design iceberg</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's explore some of the different <a id="_idIndexMarker1146"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1147"/>components of UX design that should be considered in product development:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Facilitation of product discovery</strong> involves leading the process of finding a suitable product or service, focusing on product desirability, the viability of a business model, and the feasibility of technical possibilities.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Qualitative user research</strong> includes <a id="_idIndexMarker1148"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1149"/>running interviews with users and performing contextual inquiries and other observation studies whereby the designer learns by watching users carry out their current job.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Conceptual design</strong> facilitates and contributes to the creative work at the early stages of a product or service formulation.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Prototyping</strong> ranges from paper prototypes to low-fidelity prototypes, to higher-fidelity mockups that<a id="_idIndexMarker1150"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1151"/> can be used to test ideas with users and other stakeholders.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Interaction design</strong> starts to look at what the new experience could look like by using visual storyboards and wireframes.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Human-centered service design</strong> takes a wider, macro-based approach to performing customer journey<a id="_idIndexMarker1152"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1153"/> mapping, service blueprinting, and increasing the quality of all touchpoints within a service delivery.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Quantitative data analytics</strong> processes feedback from tools such as Google Analytics and A/B testing.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Visual design</strong> is the design of the visual elements that users will see and encompasses the learning from many of the above practices.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Accessibility of IT services</strong> considers web content accessibility guidelines and other non-functional aspects.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The common denominator of all of the above practices is learning through better information and understanding of the user stakeholder. This will validate and improve the predictions <a id="_idIndexMarker1154"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1155"/>made during, for example, finding the North Star and impact mapping.</p>&#13;
			<p>A popular practice that we use at many different stages<a id="_idIndexMarker1156"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1157"/> of UX design is empathy mapping. The empathy map is a visual canvas that captures what a stakeholder is seeing, thinking, doing, and feeling within a certain context. The empathy map can be used to surface out pain points and opportunities for improvement. These then become an important source of value propositions that we can consider in our product development.</p>&#13;
			<p>We use empathy maps during the facilitation of product discovery, user research (for example, to capture notes during a user interview), getting early feedback on conceptual design, prototypes, and <a id="_idIndexMarker1158"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1159"/>visual designs. It can also be used to capture feedback regarding the user testing of developed application features:</p>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 8.20: The empathy map</p>&#13;
			<p>One of the simplest human-centered design practices that employs rapid prototyping is called Think, Make, Check. This involves creating a rapid prototype and interviewing users about it. We use iterative steps to <a id="_idIndexMarker1160"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1161"/>get to a design. During the user interview, the team can listen in to help complete the empathy map:</p>&#13;

			<p>In <em class="italics">Section 2, Establishing the foundation</em>, we introduced Mary, and we explored how the PetBattle organization created autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Mary is a self-confessed cat lover who played PetBattle regularly when it was a simple hobbyist app. She connected with Ciarán (a member of the PetBattle engineering team) who observed her using the application. Let's now see how Ciarán used an empathy map to capture all his learnings.</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-182" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor210"/>UX Design and Empathy Mapping a PetBattle User</h2>&#13;
			<p>Ciarán met Mary after she shared on Twitter how much she was loving PetBattle. They exchanged a few direct messages where Mary alluded to not fully understanding some of the quirky user interface aspects. She also felt PetBattle has great potential to move to the next level in online time consumption!</p>&#13;
			<p>Ciarán thought Mary could really help shape the thinking of the next iteration of PetBattle and validate some of the team's early assumptions. So, in return for a $20 Starbucks voucher, Mary agreed to a user interview. The rest of the PetBattle engineering team and the product owner sat in on the interview. </p>&#13;
			<p>Ciarán opened the interview by asking a few simple questions:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">What is your name?</li>&#13;
				<li>What do you do for a living?</li>&#13;
				<li>Where do you live?</li>&#13;
				<li>Do you own a pet?</li>&#13;
				<li>How did you learn about PetBattle?</li>&#13;
				<li>How and where do you tend to play PetBattle?</li>&#13;
				<li>What pet would you like to use in PetBattle?</li>&#13;
				<li>When online, what do you do when you <em class="italics">like</em> something? (When Mary struggled to answer, Ciaran gave examples of a <em class="italics">thumbs up</em> or <em class="italics">like</em> button.)</li>&#13;
				<li>How would you like to battle against someone else's pet?</li>&#13;
				<li>What would make you use PetBattle more? </li>&#13;
				<li>Does the use of theming matter to you?</li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Ciarán then asked Mary to play the old version of PetBattle so the team could see her interact with the application.</p>&#13;
<p>She uploaded a photo of her cat she had on her phone. She then struggled to understand why her cat was not appearing immediately in the competition once she'd uploaded it. Ciarán and the team knew she had to vote for another cat before hers would appear on the list, which seemed obvious to him.</p>&#13;
<p>The team observed a few other surprising things about how Mary interacted with the application (and some of the things she didn't see!).</p>&#13;
<p>Ciarán and the team thanked Mary for her time and asked whether she would be interested in returning in a week or so to help with some prototyping. Mary was glad to help.</p>&#13;
<p>Meanwhile, the team had been building Mary's empathy map which they would evolve and later play back to her to confirm their understanding and learning.</p>&#13;
<div id="_idContainer237" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="../Images/B16297_08_22.jpg" alt=""/></div>&#13;
<p>Figure 8.22: PetBattle user's Empathy Map</p>&#13;
<p>A week later, Mary returned to PetBattle. The team had been busy and produced lots of paper prototypes of some of the ideas that had come out of the impact mapping session. This included a discussion forum, targeted advertisements, a deal of the day, the scoreboard feature, and a loyalty scheme.</p>&#13;
<p>The prototypes ranged from sticky notes with sketches on to higher-fidelity wireframes. The scoreboard feature had actually been mocked up using the Sketch visual design application.</p>&#13;
<p>Different members of the team explained each idea and the prototype. Mary entered into the conversation and plenty of time was given for her to comment, feedback, query, challenge, and add her own ideas. The team who was not sharing the prototype followed the conversation with a big portable board that had Mary's empathy map on. </p>&#13;
<p>Again, Mary had been immensely helpful. Ciarán reckoned the details she had shared were gold dust and they never would have considered some of the aspects she was challenging.</p>&#13;
<p>Mary agreed to revisit every two weeks going forward so she could be the first to see and test the new features developed. This would coincide with the end of each delivery iteration and the team decided they would continue to empathy map Mary to determine what she likes about new features and what doesn't work so well and should be changed.</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>Here's another case study of this very effective practice:</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-183" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor211"/>Users Do Strange and Unexpected Things </h2>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer238" class="IMG---Figure" style="float: right; margin: 6px; hight:6cm; width:6cm;">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>As a software developer, you may look at a practice such as empathy mapping and think it sounds kind of fluffy, so why should I care about it. The first time I heard about this practice being used, I was skeptical; I couldn't connect why I should care about it as a developer. But when I realized I was missing out on so much rich contextual information regarding what users do, I was completely sold. </p>&#13;
			<p>I worked with a Rockstar designer, Bríd, building out a replacement for an HR workflow engine that was coming to its end of support with a banking customer. We used this practice against the as-is application with Vijay, one of the HR Ops team members who was responsible for responding to tickets being raised and assigning them to his team. </p>&#13;
			<p>While Bríd interviewed Vijay, the rest of the team captured notes and put them on an empathy map. We captured what activities Vijay would do using the tool and how he felt about them. The key for us was identifying gaps in the current tool and some of the shortcuts he might take. Through this research, we discovered a massive gap in the solution they had been using up to this point. </p>&#13;
			<p>Vijay, in his day-to-day use of the current application, was cutting data out of the app and opening up an Excel spreadsheet. Here he would paste a big dataset to sort and manipulate it in batches before copying it back into the tool! We were all pretty surprised to see this and it showed us that there was a huge gap in our understanding of the type of activity the current tool was built for. Had we not run this exercise with Vijay, I don't think we'd ever have found this out. Vijay and his team were going out of the app as there was critical functionality that was required in order for them to be effective. </p>&#13;
			<p>When I saw this, it was definitely a turning point for me. I could see first-hand how getting into the mind of a user was just as important for designers as it was for the techies in my team.</p>&#13;
			<p>Later, when we were building out some functionality in the app for batch updates, I was thinking of Vijay in my head. I strongly believe that if we had not used this user-centric practice, which can help uncover genuine user behavior, we would not have discovered the new functionality we needed to design and build for.</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>While working for a Finnish telecoms company, our team used this practice to bridge the gap between the Dev and Ops teams:</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-184" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor212"/>Empathy Mapping an Organization — Dev versus Ops</h2>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer239" class="IMG---Figure" style="float: right; margin: 6px; hight:6cm; width:6cm;">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/Author_4.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>An empathy map is a great tool for identifying the pains and gains of an existing or newly built application, especially ones that have a user interface or some elements of human interaction. It really can help get into the mind of some users and how they're responding to new functionality. I have found another area where this can be used – empathy mapping silos within your organization.</p>&#13;
			<p>Dev and Ops were traditionally two silos within lots of organizations. Developers can be perceived as throwing their work over the fence where the Ops team is supposed to pick it up and run with it. Sometimes, this can create friction between the two sides of the wall, often creating a blame culture with each side pointing fingers at each other as things go wrong. While working for a Finnish telecoms company, I tried this practice out in conjunction with a demo the Ops and Dev teams gave me of how they build, deploy, and monitor their applications. It worked quite well and gave me some insight into how each team was judged by the other.</p>&#13;
			<p>The image here is the empathy map from Kalle – our developer. From our session, we discovered that he felt overworked and that he was unable to go fast because of the slowness of the other team. </p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer240" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>Figure 8.23: Creating an empathy map for a Finnish telecom company</p>&#13;
			<p>He would raise requests and the Ops team would be slow to respond, impacting his ability to progress with any agility. </p>&#13;
			<p>And of course, on the other side of the divide, we had Timo in Ops, and his view was different from that of Kalle, our developer. Timo's empathy map revealed that it was a challenge for him to have to keep repeating himself to the developers and that requests coming into him were never accurate, so he'd have to push back or do lots of reworking.</p>&#13;
			<p>We played both empathy maps back to each team to start to ideate how we can work together in solving this divide.</p>&#13;
			<p>It's a simple practice to use and the information it revealed could be viewed as predictable, but from here I could start to see where the pain points lay within the company structure. It became super clear that the teams were not sharing the responsibility of delivering new functionality or fixes, but instead blaming each other when things went wrong.</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>Empathy maps play a vital role in acquiring a deep understanding of end users. Through the following case study, we discuss our take on this practice.</p>&#13;

			<p>It's a misconception that UX design is for UX designers to run by themselves. It's also a misconception that UX design should be done as a standalone phase of a project.</p>&#13;
			<p>Some of the most powerful UX designs I've seen are where the engineering community, developers, and operators have been fully engaged in the process.</p>&#13;
			<p>One example occurred at our Open Innovation Labs at Red Hat in London. During this residency engagement, our UX designer led the interview in a nicely equipped interview room in the Red Hat building. With the interviewee's permission, the whole interview was screen-cast live to the Labs space, where all of the development team were watching and capturing vital information on an empathy map.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the following photograph, you'll see the team has split into two groups, each watching two different live user interviews and building their own empathy map:</p>&#13;

			<p>There are several practice pages in the Open Practice Library that relate to <a id="_idIndexMarker1162"/>human-centered design practices. These include:</p>&#13;

			<p>These pages provide an excellent overview and starting point to explore these practices in more detail. </p>&#13;
			<p>In the next chapter, we will take a look at a discovery practice that can help our team visualize the end-to-end business process in a way that everyone can understand – the Event Storm.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-186">Con<a id="_idTextAnchor214"/>clusion</h2>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, we have been on the Discovery Loop with a focus on discovering the Why and Who of the product - Why are we building this product and who are we building it for? We started by finding our North Star Metric - a crucial metric that would be an indicator of product success.</p>&#13;
			<p>We introduced the Impact Mapping practice which helps us converge on our overall goal and understand all the different Actors that will help or impede us reaching this goal. We also learned how to define and map measurable impacts and deliverables that we can work with our Actor groups to form hypotheses statements as a basis for experimentation.</p>&#13;
			<p>We explored the different human-centered design practices that can be used with the Actor groups to form empathy and support user experience design.</p>&#13;

To be specific, it focuses on how to start the architecture and the architecture will emerge over time. We'll be exploring domain driven design and event storming as practices that help us do this. We'll also look at practices that help with non-functional aspects of our architecture - the non-functional map and metrics-based-process-mapping.</p>&#13;
