    a team member can get their work done. Following some discussion on whether PetBattle

    PetBattle to the next level was the number of pet uploads. Most of the other metrics
    were inputs that could all help drive up the number of uploads. If there are more
    users, eventually more of them will engage. As more engage, eventually more will
    want to engage more and participate. The mid/long-term impact of participation
    would drive the impact of increasing the likelihood of advertising.

    we find that different people can have different understandings or terms they
    use. In the preceding example, we may get a short conversation to differentiate
    between a **casual viewer** and an **uploader**. Some people may have just called
    these generic users. Having ubiquitous language from the outset can really help
    with the software development process. This is true for teams that focus on both
    the technical and business aspects of the product. Already, we are seeing the
    need to differentiate between different user groups in our software design.

    of capturing features or outputs when we want to focus on behavioral change on
    the actors. It also means the impact should be measurable. By thinking about how

    mapping. The empathy map is a visual canvas that captures what a stakeholder is
    seeing, thinking, doing, and feeling within a certain context. The empathy map
    can be used to surface out pain points and opportunities for improvement. These
    then become an important source of value propositions that we can consider in
    our product development.

    workflow engine that was coming to its end of support with a banking customer.

    Ops team members who was responsible for responding to tickets being raised and
    assigning them to his team.

    on an empathy map. We captured what activities Vijay would do using the tool and

    a massive gap in the solution they had been using up to this point.

    were all pretty surprised to see this and it showed us that there was a huge gap
    in our understanding of the type of activity the current tool was built for. Had
    we not run this exercise with Vijay, I don't think we'd ever have found this out.
    Vijay and his team were going out of the app as there was critical functionality

- en: An empathy map is a great tool for identifying the pains and gains of an existing
    or newly built application, especially ones that have a user interface or some
    elements of human interaction. It really can help get into the mind of some users
    and how they're responding to new functionality. I have found another area where
    this can be used – empathy mapping silos within your organization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Dev and Ops were traditionally two silos within lots of organizations. Developers
    can be perceived as throwing their work over the fence where the Ops team is supposed
    to pick it up and run with it. Sometimes, this can create friction between the
    two sides of the wall, often creating a blame culture with each side pointing
    fingers at each other as things go wrong. While working for a Finnish telecoms
    company, I tried this practice out in conjunction with a demo the Ops and Dev
    teams gave me of how they build, deploy, and monitor their applications. It worked
    quite well and gave me some insight into how each team was judged by the other.
