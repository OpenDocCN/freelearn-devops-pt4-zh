			<p>In the previous chapter, we used practices to help extract lots of detail to confirm what problems we're going to solve, who we're solving them for, and our approach to solving them in an experimental and incremental way.</p>&#13;
			<p>By using practices such as Impact Mapping and human-centered design, we should now have a good understanding of the customer and business pain points. Before we dive into developing software solutions, we need to translate those problems into potential business and customer outcomes. And we need to use all the information captured from those artifacts and the information radiated from those practices to ensure we deliver outcomes that will really matter. </p>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to explore all the learning done in the <em class="italics">Discovery</em> section of the Mobius Loop so far to clearly define and articulate the goals and outcomes the team is striving to deliver to happy stakeholders and end users. This includes:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>Explaining the difference between outputs and outcomes</li>&#13;
				<li>Why we should have Target Outcomes</li>&#13;
				<li>How to capture Target Outcomes</li>&#13;
				<li>Some examples of Target Outcomes</li>&#13;
				<li>How to visualize Target Outcomes</li>&#13;
				<li>How to optimize and chain Target Outcomes with other practices</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Setting Target Outcomes can include end user (customer-)based outcomes as well as business- and capability-based outcomes. When using Mobius, outcomes should be measurable. We should always be able to assign a numerical value to the current state and the target state. By regularly inspecting these measures, we can establish whether we are moving toward the outcome, whether we've met it, or if we need to pivot and change our approach if we're not meeting them.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-207"><a id="_idTextAnchor236"/>What Is an Outcome?</h2>&#13;
			<p>As described in <em class="italics">Section 1, Practices Make Perfect</em>, the Mobius Loop encourages an iterative, experimental approach to <a id="_idIndexMarker1295"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1296"/>achieving outcomes through a continuous flow of innovation using continuous discovery and continuous delivery. An outcome is a result that occurs from doing something. In our case, the outcome is a change in human behavior that drives change in the culture, impacting long-term business results.</p>&#13;
			<p>The Target Outcomes practice helps teams<a id="_idIndexMarker1297"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1298"/> discover, write, align on, and share the desired behavioral change they would like to see achieved by application products. Sharing Target Outcomes helps the team deliver measurable results and align with stakeholders and team members. Referring to Target Outcomes can help prioritize and filter work so that we are always focused on delivering measurable impact.</p>&#13;
			<p>The Target Outcomes practice involves creating a canvas that summarizes anticipated and hopeful measurable change captured by the team and stakeholders. This artifact serves as an information radiator, reinforcing Target Outcomes used during other practices, activities, and discussions from other parts of the Mobius Loop. The Measure and Learn element of the Delivery Loop focuses on evaluating the outcomes. We'll explore that in <em class="italics">Section 5, Deliver It</em>.  This chapter is about setting the outcomes when in the Discovery Loop. </p>&#13;

			<p>In the previous chapter, we<a id="_idIndexMarker1299"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1300"/> introduced Impact Mapping and described the differences between Impacts, which are measurable changes we want to achieve on the Actors, and a Delivery, which comprises of implementable pieces of work. Let's dive deeper into the difference between outcomes and outputs because it is very important to get this understanding.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-208">O<a id="_idTextAnchor237"/>utcomes versus Outputs</h3>&#13;
			<p>An output is a piece of work <a id="_idIndexMarker1301"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1302"/>that has a defined scope that a team completes. For example, implementing a feature, executing an experiment or carrying out some research, a UI prototype, or a technical spike. Organizations sometimes push to increase outputs because they think more features mean an increase in value. But that is not always the case. In fact, more often than not, less is more, and not all outputs translate directly into value. For example, implementing a feature does not add value if customers do not ever use the feature or, for that matter, never requested it in the first place. Think of the systems you have used that are overloaded with features that are never used, but where one or two key features are used all the time. When a team emphasizes outcomes over outputs, the team can iterate to find the right features that deliver value.</p>&#13;
			<p>Teams sometimes have difficulty identifying shared outcomes because the differences between outcomes and outputs are unclear or they are unable to see the linkage between outputs they are proposing to deliver and the outcomes the organization wants them to achieve.</p>&#13;
			<p><em class="italics">Joshua Seiden</em> describes, in his <a id="_idIndexMarker1303"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1304"/>book Outcomes Over Output,<span id="footnote-043-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-043">1</a></span> how <strong class="bold">an outcome is a change in human behavior that drives business results</strong>. We can show the subtle but very important differences between outputs, outcomes, and impacts in the figure below.</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p>By switching the conversation to be focused on outcomes, we are thinking about the impact we want to have on users and other stakeholders as demonstrated by the Impact Map through the connection between the Impacts and Actors. From our Impact Map, we have identified the different Actor groups we can actively engage with to test our hypothesis and learn by <a id="_idIndexMarker1305"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1306"/>experimentation, delivery, and feedback.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-209">Wh<a id="_idTextAnchor238"/>y Have Target Outcomes?</h3>&#13;
			<p>The Target Outcomes practice <a id="_idIndexMarker1307"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1308"/>creates shared alignment and purpose with a team, their stakeholders, and their customers.</p>&#13;
			<p>By constantly displaying Target Outcomes on a big visible information radiator, the team can be reminded of the success criteria for the project. These reminders guide the team toward project success in day-to-day activities, such as:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>Evaluation and prioritization of work items</li>&#13;
				<li>Discussions that occur in other Mobius Loop practices</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Emphasizing outcomes over outputs is a fundamental concept in the Open Practice Library. Identify Target Outcomes early on in new projects to ensure alignment from the beginning. Existing projects can run the Target Outcomes practice to assess the team's alignment and verify that the project has shared outcomes.</p>&#13;
			<p>Any one of the following<a id="_idIndexMarker1309"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1310"/> scenarios might indicate that a team will benefit from establishing Target Outcomes:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>Your team receives praise for successfully delivering a new product or feature within a given time frame and budget. However, after delivery, the team is surprised to learn that customers do not use the new product. Because the project is finished, the team cannot quickly adapt the product or feature in response to the feedback.</li>&#13;
				<li>Daily team interactions focus on completing the feature instead of completing a version of the feature that achieves desired results.</li>&#13;
				<li>Over-engineering of a feature or solution such that it is gold plated and goes way beyond what was really needed.</li>&#13;
				<li>Your teams celebrate a successful delivery before customers interact with the product or provide product feedback.</li>&#13;
				<li>The final product deliverable fails in the marketplace, despite a considerable investment of people and adhering to agile delivery methods. The use of iterations during delivery did not result in the delivery of a successful product.</li>&#13;
				<li>The scope for a team deliverable changed unexpectedly.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Let's look at how we run a short workshop to capture Target Outcomes.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-210">Ho<a id="_idTextAnchor239"/>w to Capture Target Outcomes</h3>&#13;
			<p>We often run the Target <a id="_idIndexMarker1311"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1312"/>Outcomes practice immediately after running Discovery – Why and Who practices such as creating a North Star and/or an Impact Map. We often conclude these sessions with a confidence vote by everyone involved to establish a shared view on how aligned we, as a group, feel we are.</p>&#13;
			<p>This should have resulted in a shared understanding of context across the team. If this hasn't worked, consider some of the other practices in this part of the Open Practice Library, such as Start at the End,<span id="footnote-042-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-042">2</a></span> News Headlines,<span id="footnote-041-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-041">3</a></span> or Start with Why,<span id="footnote-040-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-040">4</a></span> to establish a shared team purpose or context. Remember, the Open Practice Library is a toolbox, so if the tools you've tried have not quite worked, try another one!</p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<p>Based on the group's learnings from these activities, use a silent collaboration technique, or another brainstorming technique, to create a collection of potential Target Outcomes.</p>&#13;
			<p>Use affinity mapping<span id="footnote-039-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-039">5</a></span> to identify patterns and groupings of potential outcomes. Use a group discussion, or another technique such as Dot Voting, to achieve consensus on a small set of potential outcomes.</p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<p>Review the potential outcomes and structure them to ensure they are measurable outcomes. Identify how to quantify and measure the outcomes. Identify a common structure to express the outcomes. Review the list of measurable outcomes. Discuss the outcomes with all the stakeholders to ensure that the outcomes are not too narrow in scope and are satisfactory to everyone. Ensure everyone in the meeting consents to the measurable outcomes.</p>&#13;
			<p>To help articulate valid outcomes and evaluate <a id="_idIndexMarker1313"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1314"/>proposed outcomes, the Mobius QuickStart Guide<span id="footnote-038-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-038">6</a></span> by <em class="italics">Gabrielle Benefield</em> and <em class="italics">Ryan Shriver</em> suggests focusing on the following five attributes:</p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Name</strong> provides a simple description statement such as <strong class="bold">Decrease Time-to-Checkout</strong>. The verb is typically the direction of improvement (increase or decrease) and the noun is the subject of improvement.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">What to Measure (Scale)</strong> provides a consistent unit of measurement. Examples could be seconds to complete checkout.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">How to Measure (Method)</strong> indicates how and when to measure, such as with a daily web analytics report including who is responsible for gathering and publishing the data and how frequently this is done.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Baseline Measure</strong> provides the<a id="_idIndexMarker1315"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1316"/> current level and the starting point for comparing future measurements against. Examples could be 200 seconds to check out.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Target Measure</strong> is the desired success level in absolute or relative terms. Examples could be checkout times of<a id="_idIndexMarker1317"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1318"/> 60 seconds or 75% improvement checkout speed by Q4. Target Measures can include a date clarifying by when the target is expected to be achieved. </li>&#13;

			<p>Representing these five attributes in an arrow diagram similar to <em class="italics">Figure 10.3</em> can help visualize the outcome.</p>&#13;

			<p>Alternative formats exist that can help define outcomes. Experiment with alternative formats to discover if the team creates outcomes more effectively using them. For example, the SMART criteria (introduced in the previous picture) and summarized again below define five characteristics for an outcome or goal: specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-based.</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure">Figure 10.4: SMART outcomes</p>&#13;
			<p>A stronger outcome <a id="_idIndexMarker1319"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1320"/>statement is one that is measurable or can be broken down into a number of measures. Our approach to delivery is centered around moving to an iterative approach with regular releases of incremental value. We want to measure the outcomes as of now and then be able to measure the outcomes as we start to run experiments with feature ideas.</p>&#13;
			<p>When starting our delivery, we should be able to regularly pause and measure the impact of the experiment or initiative to ensure that we learn from it and what we are doing is either taking us toward our target-measurable outcome or triggering a pivot or re-think. </p>&#13;
			<p>Let's look at some examples. </p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-211">Exam<a id="_idTextAnchor241"/>ples of Target Outcomes </h3>&#13;
			<p>To provide context for the Target <a id="_idIndexMarker1321"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1322"/>Outcome examples in this section, consider the scenario of Issue Resolution Time.</p>&#13;
			<p>During early Discovery Loop activities, a software product team uses affinity mapping to analyze customer feedback data. The analysis shows that many customers are unhappy with the time required to resolve issues with the software. The team believes that the dissatisfaction with response time is affecting customer retention.</p>&#13;
			<p>The team uses the <strong class="bold">Metrics-Based Process Mapping</strong> (<strong class="bold">MBPM</strong>) practice, as introduced in the previous chapter, to identify significant bottlenecks that are negatively impacting response times. The exercise identifies several inefficient process components.</p>&#13;
			<p>Other Discovery Loop activities reveal that operations stakeholders are nervous about more frequent product deployments. Frequent deployments cannot result in additional planned or unplanned work for operations personnel.</p>&#13;
			<p>The team uses the Target Outcomes practice to:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>Discuss the results of the MBPM practice and other Discovery practice findings.</li>&#13;
				<li>List potential goals of the team's project.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>As a result of the Target <a id="_idIndexMarker1323"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1324"/>Outcomes practice, the team creates the information radiator visualizing three Target Outcomes.</p>&#13;
			<p>In this example, the service provider previously had a service level agreement to always resolve a complex provisioning issue (including, if necessary, site visits) within 30 days. As a result of the upcoming product development, the target is to move that to 20 days. In doing this, the organization hopes to improve customer satisfaction survey scores (out of 5) from 3.2 to 3.5. They want to do this without creating any additional manual work performed by those who work on the operations.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer308" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/B16297_10_05.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">F<a id="_idTextAnchor242"/>igure 10.5: A Target Outcomes example</p>&#13;
			<p>The Target Outcomes<a id="_idIndexMarker1325"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1326"/> artifact reminds the team to:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>Focus on finding and designing solutions that reduce the resolution time for customer issues. Successful solutions reduce the average resolution time by at least 10 days and do not increase the operations personnel's workload.</li>&#13;
				<li>The team believes that a successful solution will also increase average customer satisfaction scores by at least 0.3.</li>&#13;
				<li>If the team can deliver a solution that achieves some (but not all) of the Target Outcomes, then the team uses practices in the Options Pivot to decide if a pivot is required. They may decide to do more delivery (another Delivery Loop) to try and move the measurement further toward the target. They may decide, following feedback, that the new measure is sufficient to move onto another Target Outcome. Or some reprioritization may take place. These options will be explored in detail in the next chapter.  </li>&#13;
				<li>The team might decide to:<ul style="list-style-type:disc;"><li>Revisit Discovery practices, and update the Target Outcomes for the next quarter based on what the team learned from the previous quarter of activity.</li>&#13;
<li>Pursue a different solution to achieve the same three Target Outcomes.</li>&#13;
</ul></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The best way to articulate and understand where a product is in relation to achieving target outcomes is to use visualization.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-212">Visua<a id="_idTextAnchor243"/>lizing Target Outcomes</h3>&#13;
			<p>A single visual <a id="_idIndexMarker1327"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1328"/>showing an outcome's key attributes helps everyone clearly understand the current state and desired future state. In Mobius, these are known as outcome trackers. As ideas are planned and implemented, these visuals are updated to show progress over time. Visualization in public spaces such as team rooms or community areas helps keep the outcomes omnipresent throughout planning and design activities. This gently reminds everyone of what success looks like in a way that is accessible and clear. Showing the progress achieved so far gives teams the satisfaction that they are moving forward in a positive way. Showing lack of progress or movement in the wrong direction can trigger a quicker reaction and could even be coupled with Realtime Retrospective updates or a Stop-the-World event – practices we introduced in <em class="italics">Section 2, Establishing the Foundation</em>, when building our Open Culture foundation.</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure<a id="_idTextAnchor244"/> 10.6: Visualizing Target Outcomes</p>&#13;
			<p>Visualizing target outcomes creates alignment, shared understanding and conversation about how they can be improved and optimized.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-213"><a id="_idTextAnchor245"/>Optimizing Target Outcomes</h3>&#13;
			<p>As with all of the artifacts we introduce from practices in this book, we are <strong class="bold">never done</strong> and can always improve as we learn more from subsequent delivery and (more) discovery activities. The Target Outcomes practice is intended to provide direction at the time of the practice. As we measure and learn from the outputs of our delivery cycles, we may well learn that some of the assumptions we made during the Discovery Loop are now invalid and we can<a id="_idIndexMarker1329"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1330"/> rerun Discovery practices with this additional learning to produce an improved set of Target Outcomes. </p>&#13;
			<p>Teams can refer back to the agreed Target Outcomes throughout the loops to guide their decisions. Use the Target Outcomes to prioritize work and reject unplanned work that does not contribute to outcomes.</p>&#13;
			<p>Target Outcomes must have a time frame. Measure each Target Outcome regularly to assess progress, including at the end of the designated time period. When the time period for each outcome ends, the team evaluates the situation and decides to add new outcomes, with corresponding time periods, if needed.</p>&#13;
			<p>As we gain more information from customers as they feed back on increments of the evolving product, it can lead to course direction changes and perhaps a need for new or revised Target Outcomes. We'll explore this in much more detail when we look at the Options Pivot coming out of Discovery (in the next chapter) and the Options Pivot coming out of Delivery in <em class="italics">Section 5, Deliver It</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Target Outcomes is not a practice that can be done alone. It needs to be fed by several other practices and the result of it drives inputs to several new practices. </p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-214">Chaini<a id="_idTextAnchor246"/>ng Target Outcomes with Other Practices</h3>&#13;
			<p>The Target Outcomes practice can be run as a standalone, but we strongly recommend running it after some of the other Discovery practices. Often stakeholders will say upfront that they categorically know what the Target Outcomes of a product or initiative should be. However, after articulating the North Star of the product or organization, running <a id="_idIndexMarker1331"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1332"/>an Impact Mapping session, using a human-centered design practice <a id="_idIndexMarker1333"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1334"/>such as Design Thinking, and considering a future state architecture using Event Storming or MBPM, their view may significantly change. Target outcomes that are backed by a deeper discovery of context and increased empathy with users and stakeholders allow for a far better view of what exactly is to be achieved and why.</p>&#13;
			<p>So, we're starting to see the impact of chaining these practices together. Having all of the artifacts from the practices clearly visible to the practitioners means they can keep one eye on all of the fantastic learning achieved from their practices, for when they come to distill all the learning down into a set of target-measurable outcomes.</p>&#13;
			<p>Another great example of a practice that should not be forgotten about is Priority Sliders. During this, we gained alignment and consensus of many stakeholders to agree on the priorities of the product or project. So, we should constantly remind everyone of what we agreed here when articulating Target Outcomes. </p>&#13;
			<p>This is where great facilitation really takes place. A great facilitator will not be central to the conversations about context and detail but they will ask open questions about the information radiated during previous practices. They will also keep in mind what the group should be targeting and trying to achieve. They want to achieve target-measurable outcomes.</p>&#13;
			<p>Having a well-prepared space with plenty of sticky notes and pens can help facilitate a great Target Outcomes session. This can also be achieved in a virtual environment by using a template such as the one below, which can be downloaded from the book's GitHub repository.</p>&#13;

			<p>Let's get back to our PetBattle team and explore the Target Outcomes that resulted from their trip around the Discovery Loop.</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-215" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor247"/>PetBattle Target Outcomes</h2>&#13;
			<p>The PetBattle team aligned on the following Target Outcomes:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">PetBattle is generating revenue from an increased active user base.</li>&#13;
				<li>PetBattle is always online.</li>&#13;
				<li>An enthusiastic team that is excited to build and run PetBattle.</li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>There are three distinct categories represented here. #1 – generate revenue – is clearly a business goal that is directly linked to increased user activity (an assumption we can test). Target Outcome #2 refers to the stability and availability of the product PetBattle – when the product went viral, which crashed the system, they had very poor user experience and no chance to potentially gain revenue as PetBattle was not online for users to access! Target Outcome #3 is a team culture-based outcome – by having an engaged team who have a real sense of product ownership, they will be happier in their workplace and be more responsive and motivated to grow and improve the product in the future (another assumption we can test!).</p>&#13;
<p>Let's take our first Target Outcome, which is that PetBattle is generating revenue from an increased active user base. This can easily be seen as a measurable outcome. We can quantify at any given time the number of users registered in our system, the number of visitors to our site, the number of engaged users, the amount of engaging activity users are doing, and, of course, revenue secured through advertisers.</p>&#13;
<p>We can nicely visualize the baseline metrics we have <a id="_idIndexMarker1335"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1336"/>at this point and the target metrics we want to get to from near future increments of the product.</p>&#13;
<div id="_idContainer311" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="../Images/B16297_10_08.jpg" alt=""/></div>&#13;
<p>Figure 10.8: Target outcome – Increased active user base (in thousands)</p>&#13;
<p>Let's look at our second Target Outcome: that PetBattle is always online. From the early version of the app, there have been stability issues due to the huge popularity. We can collect a metric now on what we believe represents the uptime of the existing site and visualize how we want to improve this to the target-measurable outcome of always being online. </p>&#13;

<p>Figure 10.9: Target outcome – Always online</p>&#13;
<p>Our third Target Outcome is that we have an enthusiastic team that is excited to build and run PetBattle is focused on employee engagement and satisfaction. This can also be measured and visualized through quantifying the level of happiness and engagement of the workforce. </p>&#13;
<div id="_idContainer313" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="../Images/B16297_10_10.jpg" alt=""/></div>&#13;
<p>Figure 10.10: Target outcome – Increased employee engagement and satisfaction</p>&#13;
<p>Lots of conversation and collaboration contributes to reaching this point of consensus around Target Outcomes. When we eventually reach consensus across all stakeholder groups that these are the outcomes we will be trying to reach, we like to keep them highly visible and accessible. They should be a reference point for everything we do from this point onwards. As we start to deliver features and increments of our product, they should be taking us toward the Target Outcomes we've agreed. Capturing measurements from our products to give us real-time data out of our iterative delivery enables us to inspect, assess, adapt, and refine previous decisions made.</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>In the example above, we saw three very different focuses on outcomes. They were not just about the application or business but spread between the application, what the platform enables, and the performance and motivation of the team. This is a pattern we have observed with many customers.</p>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>In our Open Innovation Labs residencies, we work in a time box of 4-12 weeks to immerse one of our customers' product teams into DevOps culture and practices using OpenShift.</p>&#13;
			<p>We start out these engagements using practices such as Impact Mapping and human-centered design practices and aim to establish a set of Target Outcomes for the residency engagement. </p>&#13;
			<p>We've noticed that where the outcomes are not just focused on technology or the application or the culture but a combination of all three of these, the eventual impact of the engagement is much stronger.</p>&#13;
			<p>One of our early engagements established these three outcomes:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>A new standard for working with DevOps has been set, including the skill set of the team.</li>&#13;
				<li>A new application is running in production.</li>&#13;
				<li>The team feels great, excited, and empowered when working with this product.&#13;
				</li>&#13;
	&#13;
	</ul>&#13;
	<p>One of the outcomes here is related to the technology and platform (DevOps). One is related to a revenue-generating application that we were to build during the residency. The final one is about the culture and the team.</p>&#13;
	<p>This is a great balance of Target Outcomes for a first team in an organization that might be moving toward DevOps.</p>&#13;
	<p>The outcomes above do lack measures and perhaps were not as SMART as they could have been. </p>&#13;
	<p>A more recent set of outcomes with a customer in the United Arab Emirates was as follows:</p>&#13;
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
	<li>[Customer] can seamlessly deploy workloads several times a day to prove self-service capabilities.</li>&#13;
				<li>[Application] is seamlessly deployed as an example to prove a repeatable pattern for deploying N other applications and to decrease the time to market for changes.</li>&#13;
				<li>Development is a first-class citizen. Multifunctional teams are empowered using Site Reliability Engineering best practices as a Product Team.&#13;
				</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
				<p>These outcomes start to introduce the idea of something measurable. The magic word in the second outcome is decrease. There is a measurable outcome here around decreasing time to market for changes. This is something that could be measured before, during, and after the engagements.</p>&#13;
				<p>The final example comes from a non-government organization focused on healthcare:</p>&#13;
				&#13;
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>Increased level of empowerment and skills such that the [application] can be confidently owned and managed.</li>&#13;
				<li>Create a more Open Data model for [application] for [users] to be increasingly attracted to our system.</li>&#13;
				<li>A clear development lifecycle on a scalable, secure, and stable platform as measured by increased security, automation, and monitoring (auditability)&#13;
				</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Again, we see the balance of team, application, and platform in these three outcomes. All three outcomes can also be measured.</p>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			<p>Let's now look at a simple example of how we have measured an outcome.</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-217" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor249"/>Target Outcomes from a Telecoms Product – Stopwatch at the Ready!</h2>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer315" class="IMG---Figure" style="float: right; margin: 6px; hight:6cm; width:6cm;">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/author_face_1.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>One of my favorite examples of Target Outcomes that were user-centered comes from a telecommunications company we worked with in Ireland.</p>&#13;
			<p>We were building a new enterprise portal for corporate customers to browse and buy their company mobile phones.</p>&#13;
			<p>The team <a id="_idIndexMarker1337"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1338"/>used design thinking practices to establish empathy with employees of the top three enterprise customers. Empathy mapping these users and visualizing their existing processes using a scenario mapping practice highlighted several pain points and opportunities for increased user experience in our new solution.</p>&#13;
			<p>The Target Outcomes were written in a format that encompassed a Who, What, and Wow – who was going to benefit from the outcomes, what was the outcome, and what was the Wow factor, or the measure.</p>&#13;
			<p>The three <a id="_idIndexMarker1339"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1340"/>outcomes that we distilled the learning of our Discovery practices were:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>An employee can search for, view, and select their desired phone in less than 30 seconds.</li>&#13;
				<li>An employee can place an order to upgrade their device and receive their new phone ready to use with their existing number in less than 48 hours.</li>&#13;
				<li>An employee can login to the portal using their company credentials, so they don't need to set up or remember another username and password.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>These outcomes are very micro-focused on a particular product. The first two are very measurable and you can imagine our team had the stopwatch out in user testing against the first of them!</p>&#13;
<p>I loved these outcomes because, written up on a big visible chart, it summarized for everyone walking by our team space what we were trying to achieve. We needed an app where time-constrained users could do what they needed to do quickly, they would receive their order quickly, and it would just work and they would not feel like they needed to engage with yet another company – their experience would remain aligned to their company employment.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
			<p>We've now seen a few different examples of Target Outcomes set during engagements with different customers. One thing you may have noticed is that Target Outcomes can range from being very end user-centric to being more about the technology, platform, and team being used to develop the application. This leads us to explore the idea of primary outcomes (more end user-centric) and enabling<a id="_idIndexMarker1341"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1342"/> outcomes (delivered by the platform and team).<a id="_idTextAnchor250"/></p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-218"><a id="_idTextAnchor251"/>Differentiating between Primary Outcomes and Enabling Outcomes</h2>&#13;
			<p>In the previous two chapters, we used several different practices to discover the Target Outcomes. Some of them are more functional-, application product-, and business-focused (the Why and Who), and some are more non-functional-focused (the How).</p>&#13;
			<p>As we discover these different types of outcomes, we can explore relationships between them and see whether a hierarchy exists or not. </p>&#13;
			<p><em class="italics">Gabrielle </em><em class="italics"><a id="_idIndexMarker1343"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1344"/></em><em class="italics">Benefield</em> and <em class="italics">Ryan Shriver</em> <a id="_idIndexMarker1345"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1346"/>explain<span id="footnote-037-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-037">7</a></span> that <em class="italics">Enabling Outcomes, such as decreasing time to onboard new developers, improving test automation and reducing the time to build and deploy code, will hopefully improve primary outcomes such as improve customer experience.</em></p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<p>This may just be<a id="_idIndexMarker1347"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1348"/> a hypothesis that needs validation through experimentation and delivery. </p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p>Let's look at some common<a id="_idIndexMarker1349"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1350"/> examples of outcomes that are a mix of primary and enabling outcomes.</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Increasing Speed and Quality with Customers</strong>:<ul style="list-style-type:disc;"><li><strong class="bold">Improve Customer Satisfaction</strong>: Measuring customer happiness using tools such as <strong class="bold">Net Promoter Score</strong> (<strong class="bold">NPS</strong>).</li>&#13;
<li><strong class="bold">Reduce Lead Time</strong>: Elapsed time from the initial customer request or contact to delivery triggering customer happiness.</li>&#13;
</ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Increasing Quality</strong>:<ul style="list-style-type:disc;"><li><strong class="bold">Reduce Outages</strong>: Number of operational incidents leaving customers with no service.</li>&#13;
<li><strong class="bold">Reduce Defects</strong>: Number of defects in the product that impact customers.</li>&#13;
</ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Sustainability</strong>: <ul style="list-style-type:disc;"><li><strong class="bold">Improve Team Satisfaction</strong>: A measurement of the happiness of a product team.</li>&#13;
<li><strong class="bold">Increase Employee Retention</strong>: Turnover rate of employees.</li>&#13;
</ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Working</strong>:<ul style="list-style-type:disc;"><li><strong class="bold">Increase Throughput</strong>: Total work items completed per unit of time.</li>&#13;
<li><strong class="bold">Improve Predictability</strong>: Percentage of time team delivers on their commitments. </li>&#13;
<li><strong class="bold">Increase Agility</strong>: Elapsed time to pivot to new priorities.</li>&#13;
</ul></li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Efficiency</strong>:<ul style="list-style-type:disc;"><li><strong class="bold">Reduce Cycle Time</strong>: The elapsed time to complete delivery activities such as build, test, and deployment of new features. </li>&#13;
<li><strong class="bold">Reduce Work in Progress (WIP)</strong>: Number of items a team is working on at any moment. </li>&#13;
<li><strong class="bold">Reduce Technical Debt</strong>: How much you're spending on reworking your codebase.</li>&#13;
</ul></li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The organization's specific context will drive whether they are more focused on one or two of these and set them as their primary Target Outcomes. If the motivation is more business-focused, their primary outcome is likely to be around the performance of their products with their customer, and their customer's satisfaction.</p>&#13;
			<p>Nearly all of the examples above can<a id="_idIndexMarker1351"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1352"/> also be enabling outcomes, and we can form hypotheses of how improving these can drive improvements in more business-focused outcomes. These examples also steer our focus toward exploring software delivery techniques (such as DevOps) and the platform (such as OpenShift).</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-219"><a id="_idTextAnchor252"/>Software Delivery Metrics</h3>&#13;
			<p>In 2018, the book <em class="italics">Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations</em>, written <a id="_idIndexMarker1353"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1354"/>by <em class="italics">Jez Humble, Gene Kim, and Nicole Forsgren</em>, was first <a id="_idIndexMarker1355"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1356"/>published. We<a id="_idIndexMarker1357"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1358"/> cannot recommend this book highly enough to explain how to effectively measure software delivery team performance and the science and statistics behind their extensive research. </p>&#13;
			<p>The book addresses four metrics that can be used to assess the health of any DevOps organization. Two of them are more development-centric and measure market agility, and two are more Operations focused and measures of reliability.</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Lead time for change</strong>: This is the time from code being committed to a source code repository to it being deployed to production. Shorter lead times for change is better because it enables faster feedback cycles and makes organizations better able to adjust to the marketplace.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Deployment frequency</strong>: This is how often an application is deployed to production and is an indicator of batch size. Smaller batch sizes mean deployments can be made more frequently, which also leads to more market agility. </li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Mean time to restore</strong>: This is how long it takes for systems to recover from failures in production. We want to reduce this which is important because we need to ensure we aren't speeding up delivery at the expense of poor customer experience from failures. </li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Change failure rate</strong>: This is the percentage of deployments requiring a rollback and/or fixes for a problem in production, which, again, we want to reduce as this is a secondary indicator of stability. </li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>When we consider all four of these as enabling outcomes for a software product, we can see the strong hypothesis on<a id="_idIndexMarker1359"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1360"/> how optimizing these will have a positive impact on the product's performance in the marketplace and overall customer satisfaction. Being able to have short lead times for change and a high frequency of deployments, while maintaining a low mean time to restore and low change failure rate, would suggest an overall high-performing product. That will eventually translate to a higher NPS, increased conversion rates, and even increased market share as customers tend to really like using fast-moving yet reliable software.</p>&#13;
			<p>As this book has started to demonstrate, teams that successfully adopt the practices being introduced will see a positive effect in these software delivery metrics. The cultural practices, along with other <a id="_idIndexMarker1361"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1362"/>practices such as metrics-based process mapping, identify the bottlenecks and handovers that, when removed, can speed lead times to change. The continuous integration and continuous delivery practices being used when we build pipelines allow us to increase deployments. And, with increasing levels of automation and continuous learning from practices such as retrospectives, we can keep <strong class="bold">Mean Time to Repair</strong> (<strong class="bold">MTTR</strong>) and <a id="_idIndexMarker1363"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1364"/>Change Failure Rates to a minimum.</p>&#13;
			<p>Platforms such as OpenShift provide an even further level of enablement. Without these platforms, we wouldn't be able to achieve market agility and reliability for the software products being deployed on the platform.</p>&#13;
			<p>So, if the platform is the lowest level of enablement, are there metrics we can baseline and regularly check to ensure this enablement is being passed up to software teams and eventually to the business? Let's look at <a id="_idIndexMarker1365"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1366"/>a few platform adoption metrics.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor253"/>Platform Adoption Metrics</h3>&#13;
			<p>Some of the metrics you might want to capture about the platform include:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Rate of Growth and Adoption:</strong> How much change is happening in products provisioned on the platform? How many services are running? </li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Lead Time to Onboard:</strong> How long does it take to onboard a new developer or operator on the platform such that they have everything they need to do their job?</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Lead Time to Provision Projects:</strong> How long does it take to provision a new project on the platform so it is running in production and usable?</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Platform Team Efficiency</strong><strong class="bold">:</strong> What is the number of full-time employees needed compared to the number of applications supported? Given that there should be huge economies of scale from platform adoption, we expect this ratio to substantially increase as platform adoption increases.</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">Site Reliability Engineering metrics:</strong> Given that the platform provides an enabler for the Site Reliability Engineering mindset, some of the metrics and associated practices can be radiated:<ul style="list-style-type:disc;"><li>Service availability/service level objectives</li>&#13;
<li>Remaining error budget</li>&#13;
<li>Development time versus issue/support time</li>&#13;
</ul></li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Again, we start to see the impact these measures can have on software delivery and operations of applications running on the platform, which, in turn, can be measured by the four software delivery metrics. And these metrics can generate a lagging effect on the quality of the software, the organization's products, and the happiness of their customer and employees. So, the value of capturing, measuring, visualizing, and sharing these metrics cannot be underestimated.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's look at our approach for growing this metric-centric mindset.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor254"/>Continuous Metrics Inspection</h3>&#13;
			<p>We start small and focus on just<a id="_idIndexMarker1367"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1368"/> one application, one team, one product. We do not want to boil the ocean by getting hundreds of metrics across an IT estate. Instead, we want to have a team that is empowered, enabled, and enthused by these metrics.</p>&#13;
			<p>First, we need to baseline what we can by running a Target Outcomes workshop. This should include capturing the key primary outcomes – ideally two or three that the team are laser-focused on achieving.</p>&#13;
			<p>Next, we look at what other metrics we know or can find out about existing software delivery and the platform. If we can get this information, let's make it visible. If not, let's commit to starting to capture it.</p>&#13;
			<p>We make these outcomes and known metrics about the product, software delivery, and platform very transparent and visible. The more transparent you can be about current performance, the easier it will be to demonstrate improvement. Using Big Visible Information Radiators, there's no end to improvement. Having the information continuously radiating will enable informed decision making that is data-driven. It's all part of an ongoing process. Once an organization has invested in collecting metrics, it's time to start continually improving on them. The key here is an experimentation model that could involve process changes and ways of working, new architecture, and changes to team composition or organization structure. We will be exploring this in the next chapter as we consider our options.</p>&#13;
			<p>Before that, we're going to create one final information radiator on this iteration of the Discovery Loop to provide a single-page summary of everything we have learned on this trip around the Discovery Loop.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-222"><a id="_idTextAnchor255"/>Creating a Discovery Map</h2>&#13;
			<p>The Discovery practices<a id="_idIndexMarker1369"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1370"/> described in this <a id="_idIndexMarker1371"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1372"/>section all revolve around facilitating great conversations across the many different roles and functions across the organization. If you've used the Discovery practices we described in <em class="italics">Chapter 8, Discovering the Why and Who</em>, and <em class="italics">Chapter 9, Discovering the How</em>, you'll already have a large number of information radiators – a North Star, an Impact Map, human-centered design artifacts such as Empathy Maps, an Event Storm, Non-Functional Maps, MBPMs, Target Outcome canvases, and baseline metrics. And of course, there are many other Discovery practices in the<a id="_idIndexMarker1373"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1374"/> Open Practice Library that you may have tried, and each tends to produce at least one information radiator canvas. </p>&#13;
			<p>Within each of these artifacts is very powerful and valuable information, which is why we want to keep them all visible and accessible to anyone who is interested – be it team members or stakeholders. There will no doubt be wrong information and incomplete artifacts – that's kind of the point of this process. We only <a id="_idIndexMarker1375"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1376"/>ever do just enough discovery to progress to the Options Pivot and start an iteration of delivery. By this, we mean there is a consensus across stakeholders, an alignment of shared understanding on product direction, and confidence in the delivery team that they have what they need to get started with delivery. As we learn more and more and get feedback and increase our number of measurements, we can improve and complete Discovery artifacts further (or maybe even try some new practices).</p>&#13;
			<p>We do find it helpful to distill and harness all the information from the Discovery practices into a single summary that can be publicly displayed and used as an information radiator for those who may not have the time or interest to get into the detail. Having a single page that describes the product discovery and Target Outcomes provides a great opportunity for alignment and agreement of product direction.</p>&#13;
			<p>There are many canvases openly available, including the Business Model canvas and the Lean canvas. The Mobius Loop has also <a id="_idIndexMarker1377"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1378"/>open-sourced a Discovery Map, which is a simple graphic used to summarize:</p>&#13;

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-223">Co<a id="_idTextAnchor256"/>nclusion</h2>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, we focused on setting Target Outcomes for the business problems and opportunities we uncovered in the previous chapters.</p>&#13;
			<p>We explained what an outcome is and how it is different from output, and how we capture them, write them, measure them, and visualize them.</p>&#13;
			<p>We dived deeper into measurable outcomes and metrics and explored the difference between primary outcomes and enabling <a id="_idIndexMarker1379"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1380"/>outcomes. Enabling outcomes in a DevOps world is heavily focused on software delivery metrics and platform metrics. </p>&#13;
			<p>You can read more and chat about the practice of setting Target Outcomes in the Open Practice Library at <a href="http://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/target-outcomes/">openpracticelibrary.com/practice/target-outcomes/</a>.</p>&#13;

We'll look at the trade-offs between feature delivery and non-functional work to improve software delivery and platform. And, we'll explore some of the advanced deployment capabilities offered by OpenShift and other platforms that will help us further decide on how to deliver the best value and products to customers.</p>&#13;
