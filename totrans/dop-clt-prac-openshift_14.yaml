    be measurable. We should always be able to assign a numerical value to the current

    an iterative, experimental approach to achieving outcomes through a continuous
    flow of innovation using continuous discovery and continuous delivery. An outcome
    is a result that occurs from doing something. In our case, the outcome is a change

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An output is a piece of work that has a defined scope that a team completes.
    For example, implementing a feature, executing an experiment or carrying out some
    research, a UI prototype, or a technical spike. Organizations sometimes push to
    increase outputs because they think more features mean an increase in value. But
    that is not always the case. In fact, more often than not, less is more, and not
    all outputs translate directly into value. For example, implementing a feature
    does not add value if customers do not ever use the feature or, for that matter,
    never requested it in the first place. Think of the systems you have used that
    are overloaded with features that are never used, but where one or two key features
    are used all the time. When a team emphasizes outcomes over outputs, the team
    can iterate to find the right features that deliver value.

    consensus around Target Outcomes. When we eventually reach consensus across all
    stakeholder groups that these are the outcomes we will be trying to reach, we
    like to keep them highly visible and accessible. They should be a reference point
    for everything we do from this point onwards. As we start to deliver features
    and increments of our product, they should be taking us toward the Target Outcomes
    we've agreed. Capturing measurements from our products to give us real-time data
    out of our iterative delivery enables us to inspect, assess, adapt, and refine
    previous decisions made.

    we can see the strong hypothesis on how optimizing these will have a positive
    impact on the product's performance in the marketplace and overall customer satisfaction.
    Being able to have short lead times for change and a high frequency of deployments,
    while maintaining a low mean time to restore and low change failure rate, would
    suggest an overall high-performing product. That will eventually translate to
    a higher NPS, increased conversion rates, and even increased market share as customers
    tend to really like using fast-moving yet reliable software.

    being introduced will see a positive effect in these software delivery metrics.
    The cultural practices, along with other practices such as metrics-based process
    mapping, identify the bottlenecks and handovers that, when removed, can speed
    lead times to change. The continuous integration and continuous delivery practices
    being used when we build pipelines allow us to increase deployments. And, with
    increasing levels of automation and continuous learning from practices such as
    retrospectives, we can keep **Mean Time to Repair** (**MTTR**) and Change Failure
    Rates to a minimum.

    a lagging effect on the quality of the software, the organization's products,
    and the happiness of their customer and employees. So, the value of capturing,

    continuously radiating will enable informed decision making that is data-driven.
    It's all part of an ongoing process. Once an organization has invested in collecting
    metrics, it's time to start continually improving on them. The key here is an
    experimentation model that could involve process changes and ways of working,
    new architecture, and changes to team composition or organization structure. We

    If you've used the Discovery practices we described in *Chapter 8, Discovering

    large number of information radiators – a North Star, an Impact Map, human-centered
    design artifacts such as Empathy Maps, an Event Storm, Non-Functional Maps, MBPMs,
    Target Outcome canvases, and baseline metrics. And of course, there are many other
    Discovery practices in the Open Practice Library that you may have tried, and
    each tends to produce at least one information radiator canvas.

    is why we want to keep them all visible and accessible to anyone who is interested
    – be it team members or stakeholders. There will no doubt be wrong information
    and incomplete artifacts – that's kind of the point of this process. We only ever
    do just enough discovery to progress to the Options Pivot and start an iteration
    of delivery. By this, we mean there is a consensus across stakeholders, an alignment
    of shared understanding on product direction, and confidence in the delivery team
    that they have what they need to get started with delivery. As we learn more and
    more and get feedback and increase our number of measurements, we can improve
    and complete Discovery artifacts further (or maybe even try some new practices).
