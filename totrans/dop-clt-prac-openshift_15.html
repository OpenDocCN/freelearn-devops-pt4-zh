			<p>In <em class="italics">Section 3, Discover It</em>, we worked our way around the Discovery Loop. We started with Why—why are we embarking on this initiative? What is our great idea? We used the North Star to help us frame this. We defined the problem and understood the context further by using the Impact Mapping practice to align on our strategic goal. Impact Mapping helped us converge on all the different actors involved that could help us achieve or impede our goal. Impact Mapping captures the measurable impacts we want to effect and the behavioral changes we would like to generate for those actors. From this, we form hypothesis statements <a id="_idIndexMarker1383"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1384"/>about how the different ideas for deliverables may help achieve these impacts.</p>
			<p>We refined this understanding further by using the human-centered design techniques and Design Thinking practices such as Empathy Mapping and Contextual Inquiry to observe and connect with our actors. We explored business processes and domain models using the Event Storming practice by generating a shared understanding of the event-driven process. Using the Event Storming notation, a microservices-based architecture started to emerge. We also discovered non-functional aspects of the design by using Non-Functional Maps and running Metrics-Based Process Mapping.</p>
			<p>The Discovery Loop presented <a id="_idIndexMarker1385"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1386"/>lots of ideas for things we can do in our delivery cycles—features we can implement; architectures that emerge as we refine and develop the solution by repeated playthroughs of the Event Storm; research that can be performed using user interface prototypes or technical spikes that test our ideas further; experiments that can be run with our users to help get an even better understanding of their motivations, pain points, and what value means to them; and processes we can put in place to gather data and optimize metrics.</p>

			<p>From just the first<a id="_idIndexMarker1387"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1388"/> iteration of the Discovery Loop, it would be very easy to come up with hundreds of different tasks we could do from all the conversations and engagement that those practices generate. It can be a minefield visualizing all these ideas and it can take weeks, if not months, to generate tasks for a small team just from a short iteration of the Discovery Loop! So, we need to be careful to ensure we remain focused on delivering value, outcomes that matter, and that we don't get bogged down in analysis-paralysis in a world filled purely with busyness!</p>
			<p>Before we left the Discovery Loop, we took time to translate all of this learning into measurable Target Outcomes. This started with the primary target outcomes associated with the business product, but we also took time to recognize some of the secondary targets and enabling outcomes that can help support development—especially those that can be enabled by software delivery processes and underlying platforms such as OpenShift.</p>
			<p>With these outcomes visualized and presented using big visible Information Radiators, supporting metrics can also be baselined and radiated. We can now think about all those tasks and ideas that resulted from the Discovery Loop. But we can only do so by keeping an eye on those outcomes at all times and ensuring everything we do is directly or indirectly going to take us toward achieving them. This is where the real fun begins, because we're going to explore <strong class="bold">how</strong> we're going to achieve those measurable outcomes.</p>
			<p>Mobius uses the word <strong class="bold">options</strong> instead of <strong class="bold">solutions</strong>, or the dreaded term <strong class="bold">requirements</strong>. Until we validate our ideas, they are simply wild guesses, so calling them solutions or saying they are required is not logical and there is no evidence to support them. Instead, we call them potential solutions, options, and we get to test them out in the Delivery Loop to prove or<a id="_idIndexMarker1389"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1390"/> disprove the hypothesis that we have formed around those options. This drives us to a more data-driven approach rather than just simply guessing.</p>

			<p>When we are on the <strong class="bold">Options Pivot</strong>, we decide which of the outcomes we are going to target next. We choose which ideas or hypotheses we need to build, test, validate, and learn from, as well as exploring how we might deliver the <strong class="bold">options</strong>. We also need to get a sense of priority. We never have the luxury of infinite time and resources, so prioritization is always going to be the key to achieving business value and fast learning. Learning fast is an important aspect here. We want to generate options that can validate, or invalidate, our ideas from the Discovery Loop so we can ultimately revisit and enhance them. Fast feedback is the key to connecting the Discovery artifacts with a validated prototype.</p>
			<p><em class="italics">Chapter 11, The Options Pivot</em>, will focus on the practices we use before we begin a Delivery Loop. We will return to the Options Pivot again after the Delivery Loop in <em class="italics">Section 7, Improve It, Sustain It</em>, when we take the learnings and measurements that have resulted from the latest Delivery Loop iteration and decide what to do next given these findings.</p>
