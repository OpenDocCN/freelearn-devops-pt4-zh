- en: In *Section 3, Discover It*, we worked our way around the Discovery Loop. We
    started with Why—why are we embarking on this initiative? What is our great idea?
    We used the North Star to help us frame this. We defined the problem and understood
    the context further by using the Impact Mapping practice to align on our strategic
    goal. Impact Mapping helped us converge on all the different actors involved that
    could help us achieve or impede our goal. Impact Mapping captures the measurable
    impacts we want to effect and the behavioral changes we would like to generate
    for those actors. From this, we form hypothesis statements about how the different
    ideas for deliverables may help achieve these impacts.

- en: We refined this understanding further by using the human-centered design techniques
    and Design Thinking practices such as Empathy Mapping and Contextual Inquiry to
    observe and connect with our actors. We explored business processes and domain
    models using the Event Storming practice by generating a shared understanding
    of the event-driven process. Using the Event Storming notation, a microservices-based
    architecture started to emerge. We also discovered non-functional aspects of the
    design by using Non-Functional Maps and running Metrics-Based Process Mapping.

- en: The Discovery Loop presented lots of ideas for things we can do in our delivery
    cycles—features we can implement; architectures that emerge as we refine and develop
    the solution by repeated playthroughs of the Event Storm; research that can be
    performed using user interface prototypes or technical spikes that test our ideas
    further; experiments that can be run with our users to help get an even better
    understanding of their motivations, pain points, and what value means to them;
    and processes we can put in place to gather data and optimize metrics.

- en: From just the first iteration of the Discovery Loop, it would be very easy to
    come up with hundreds of different tasks we could do from all the conversations
    and engagement that those practices generate. It can be a minefield visualizing
    all these ideas and it can take weeks, if not months, to generate tasks for a
    small team just from a short iteration of the Discovery Loop! So, we need to be
    careful to ensure we remain focused on delivering value, outcomes that matter,
    and that we don't get bogged down in analysis-paralysis in a world filled purely
    with busyness!

- en: Before we left the Discovery Loop, we took time to translate all of this learning
    into measurable Target Outcomes. This started with the primary target outcomes
    associated with the business product, but we also took time to recognize some
    of the secondary targets and enabling outcomes that can help support development—especially
    those that can be enabled by software delivery processes and underlying platforms
    such as OpenShift.

    supporting metrics can also be baselined and radiated. We can now think about
    all those tasks and ideas that resulted from the Discovery Loop. But we can only
    do so by keeping an eye on those outcomes at all times and ensuring everything
    we do is directly or indirectly going to take us toward achieving them. This is
    where the real fun begins, because we're going to explore **how** we're going
    to achieve those measurable outcomes.

- en: Mobius uses the word **options** instead of **solutions**, or the dreaded term
    **requirements**. Until we validate our ideas, they are simply wild guesses, so
    calling them solutions or saying they are required is not logical and there is
    no evidence to support them. Instead, we call them potential solutions, options,
    and we get to test them out in the Delivery Loop to prove or disprove the hypothesis
    that we have formed around those options. This drives us to a more data-driven
    approach rather than just simply guessing.

- en: When we are on the **Options Pivot**, we decide which of the outcomes we are
    going to target next. We choose which ideas or hypotheses we need to build, test,
    validate, and learn from, as well as exploring how we might deliver the **options**.
    We also need to get a sense of priority. We never have the luxury of infinite
    time and resources, so prioritization is always going to be the key to achieving
    business value and fast learning. Learning fast is an important aspect here. We
    want to generate options that can validate, or invalidate, our ideas from the
    Discovery Loop so we can ultimately revisit and enhance them. Fast feedback is
    the key to connecting the Discovery artifacts with a validated prototype.

    we begin a Delivery Loop. We will return to the Options Pivot again after the
    Delivery Loop in *Section 7, Improve It, Sustain It*, when we take the learnings
    and measurements that have resulted from the latest Delivery Loop iteration and
    decide what to do next given these findings.'
