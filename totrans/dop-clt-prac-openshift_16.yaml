    The Impact Map gave us deliverables that formed hypothesis statements. The human-centered
    design and Empathy Mapping practices gave us ideas directly from the user. The
    Event Storm gave us standalone features (triggered by commands) that can be implemented
    using standalone microservices (codifying the aggregate). The Metrics-Based Process
    Map and Non-Functional Map gave us ideas on how we can speed up the development
    cycle and improve security, maintainability, operability, scalability, auditability,
    traceability, reusability, and just about anything else that ends with ability!

- en: An iteration of the Delivery Loop is not prescribed in length. If you are using
    a popular iterative agile delivery framework such as Scrum, an iteration of the
    Delivery Loop translates well to one sprint (a fixed time-box between one and
    four weeks). If you are using a more continuous delivery approach such as Kanban
    to enable an ongoing flow of value, each Delivery Loop may simply represent the
    processing of one Product Backlog item and delivering it into the product. You
    may even be using a non-agile delivery methodology such as Waterfall whereby the
    Delivery Loop is more singular and slower to move around. The Mobius Loop is agnostic
    to the delivery approach. But what is consistent regardless of the delivery approach
    is the idea that we seek to deliver high-value work sooner, establish important
    learning more quickly, and work in small batch sizes of delivery effort so we
    can measure and learn the impact to inform our next set of decisions.

  zh: 交付循环的迭代没有规定具体的时长。如果你正在使用如 Scrum 这样的流行迭代敏捷交付框架，那么交付循环的迭代可以很好地转换为一个 sprint（一个固定的时间框，通常为一到四周）。如果你使用的是如
    Kanban 这样的更为持续的交付方式来支持价值的持续流动，那么每个交付循环可能仅代表处理一个产品待办事项并将其交付到产品中。你甚至可能使用非敏捷的交付方法，如瀑布模型，在这种情况下，交付循环可能更加单一且移动缓慢。Mobius
    循环对交付方法是中立的。但无论交付方法如何，一致的理念是：我们追求尽早交付高价值工作，更快地建立重要的学习，并以小批量交付的方式工作，这样我们可以衡量并学习影响，从而为下一轮决策提供参考。

    from the Discovery Loop and set them as the headings to categorize each item under.
    The reason we do this is that we want to work with an outcome-driven mindset.
    We have agreed on some Target Outcomes so, really, every work item we are considering
    should be taking us to one or more of those outcomes. If we pick any one of the
    items and can't easily see an outcome it will help achieve, we should be questioning
    the value of doing that thing at all. (There are cases where such items that don't

- en: One of the first times I ran it, we had organized all the work into columns
    linked to Target Outcomes and we progressed to the slicing part of the practice.
    I placed one slice of tape on the wall and asked the Product Owner and stakeholders
    to move the sticky notes they deemed the most valuable above that line of tape
    and the less valuable ones beneath that line.

  zh: 在我第一次进行这个活动时，我们将所有工作按照目标成果组织成了几列，并进入了切片环节。我把一条胶带放在墙上，要求产品负责人和利益相关者将他们认为最有价值的便利贴放在胶带线以上，将较不重要的便利贴放在胶带线以下。
- en: As I observed the team working through this process, I realized that the single
    line of tape had generated a misleading point of this practice. There was a reluctance
    to put anything beneath the line because there was a perception that this meant
    **out of scope**. I explained this was not the case and what I was trying to do
    was slice out the **Minimal Viable Product** or **MVP**. MVP defines the minimum
    number of features that could form the product that could be released to users
    to learn from and build upon. In reality, many stakeholders see defining the MVP
    as something negative as it's where they lose all the great innovative featuresthat
    they may want but are not collectively deemed important. I actually try to avoid
    using the term MVP, as it is often greeted with some negative emotion.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 当我观察团队在这个过程中工作的时，我意识到那一条胶带线产生了一个误导性的实践观点。大家不愿意将任何东西放在那条线以下，因为有一种误解认为这意味着**超出范围**。我解释说情况并非如此，我试图做的是划分出**最小可行产品**（**MVP**）。MVP定义了可以构成产品的最小特性集，这个产品可以发布给用户，从中学习并进行迭代。实际上，许多利益相关者将定义MVP视为一种负面事情，因为这是他们失去所有创新性特性的时候，这些特性他们可能希望拥有，但并没有被认为是重要的。我实际上尽量避免使用MVP这个术语，因为它通常会引发一些负面情绪。

    not defining things as in or out of scope and we are not defining just the MVP.

  zh: 我从这次引导中学到，切片永远不应该只使用一条，因为我们并不是在定义哪些内容是“在范围内”或“超出范围”，也不是仅仅定义MVP。
- en: Working with another customer in Finland, I took this learning and adapted my
    facilitation approach. With all the items that had been captured from the Discovery
    Loop on the map, I produced three slices of tape. Hopefully now the Product Owner
    and stakeholders would not fall into the in-scope/out-of-scope trap. However,
    now there was a new misunderstanding! For this particular engagement, which was
    an immersive four-week Open Innovation Labs residency focused on improved operations,
    we had planned three one-week sprints. By coincidence, I had produced three slices
    of tape for Value Slicing. So, the stakeholders and Product Owner assumed that
    whatever we put in the first slice would form the scope for Sprint 1, the second
    slice would be Sprint 2, and the third slice would be Sprint 3.

  zh: 在与芬兰的另一位客户合作时，我将这些经验教训应用到我的引导方式中。对于所有从发现循环中捕获的项，我在地图上制作了三条胶带切片。希望现在产品负责人和相关方不会再掉入范围内/范围外的陷阱。然而，现在出现了一个新的误解！对于这次特定的合作，这是一场为期四周的沉浸式开放创新实验室驻场，专注于改进运营，我们计划了三次为期一周的冲刺。巧合的是，我制作了三条胶带进行价值切片。因此，相关方和产品负责人认为，我们在第一条切片中放入的内容将形成冲刺
    1 的范围，第二条切片是冲刺 2，第三条切片是冲刺 3。

    take the team to deliver each item in each slice. We will use other practices
    in the Delivery Loop to help us understand that. We could end up delivering more
    than one slice in one sprint. Or, it may take more than one sprint to deliver
    one slice. We just don't know yet.

- en: Since then, I have tweaked my facilitation further. When making the slices available,
    I now produce lots of them – at least 10, sometimes more than 20\. I also make
    the roll of tape accessible and tell the Product Owner to use as many slices as
    they would like – the more the better, in fact! I've found Value Slice Maps now
    often have many more slices.

  zh: 从那时起，我进一步调整了我的引导方式。当制作切片时，我现在会产生大量的切片——至少 10 个，有时会超过 20 个。我还会让胶带卷易于获取，并告诉产品负责人使用他们想要的任意数量的切片——事实上，越多越好！我发现现在的价值切片图通常会有更多的切片。
- en: A Product Owner from a UK defensecompany once remarked to me that you could
    argue that each item on the Value Slice board could be its own slice of value.

    release plans that can drive iterative and incremental delivery practices. We
    highly recommend reading Patton's book and trying out the exercise he describes
    in his fifth chapter about visualizing and slicing out the value of something
    very simple, like everything you do in the morning to get up, get ready, and travel

    and the subject of his book *The Principles of Product Development Flow – Second
    Generation Lean Product Development*. Reinertsen famously said, *If you quantify
    one thing, quantify the cost of delay.* Josh Arnold explains how the *Cost of
    Delay is calculated by assessing the impact of not having something when you need
    it. As a typical example this might be the cost incurred while waiting to deliver
    a solution that improves efficiency. It is the opportunity cost between having
    the same thing now, or getting it later.*[4](#footnote-049)

    Arnold解释了如何通过评估在需要时没有某个东西所带来的影响来计算*延迟成本。举一个典型的例子，可能就是等待交付一项提高效率的解决方案所产生的成本。它是现在拥有同样东西和稍后获得它之间的机会成本*。[4](#footnote-049)

    not saving by not implementing this feature? If the value of the item is revenue-related,

    for example, shipping in retail can be very time-sensitive around, say, the holiday
    season. Changes may be needed for legislation and compliance. The cost can be

    the amazing work of Henrik Kniberg. If you have not seen his 15-minute video on
    YouTube entitled *Product Ownership in a Nutshell*,[8](#footnote-045) please put
    this book down, go and get a cup of tea, and watch the video now. Maybe even watch

    no prior history or engagement with the organization. We quickly learned that
    he had no empowerment to make decisions as he constantly had to assemble meetings
    with stakeholders any time a Scrum team needed clarification or asked to do some
    Product Backlog refinement. Product Owners need to be empowered.

    senior business-focused person who was a direct report of the CIO. This was better
    as he certainly was empowered to make fast decisions and prioritization choices.
    The challenge this time was getting access to him regularly. He promised us one
    hour per week. With a Product Backlog that needed a lot of refinement and a lot
    of clarification to development teams, this was nowhere near enough. Product Owners
    need to be available to their team(s).

    about the traffic, interaction, time spent, and other relevant metrics, which

    the change in user behavior. The test determines which version is performing better

    two productive environments being available to the team. One of them, let's call
    it **green**, is operational and takes load from the reverse proxy (load balancer/router).
    The other environment, let's call it **blue**, is a copy upgraded to a new version.
    It is disconnected from the load balancing while this upgrade is completed.

    safety for performing complex releases. It removes the time pressure and reduces
    the downtime to practically zero. This is beneficial for both technical teams
    and end users who will not notice glitches or unavailability of the service/product,
    provided that the new version is performing at par. In case of adverse effects,
    it allows the teams to have an instant roll-back alternative and limit the negative
    impact on customers.

    a small number of the real users of a product will be exposed to the new version

- en: The canary release provides continuous delivery teams with safety by enabling
    them to perform a phased rollout, gradually increasing the number of users on
    a new version of a product. While rolling out the new version, the team will be
    closely monitoring the performance of the platform, trying to understand the impacts
    of the new version, and assessing the risks of adverse effects such as regressions,
    performance issues, and even downtime. This approach allows the team to **roll
    back** the release as soon as such adverse effects are observed without the majority
    of the customers being impacted even for a limited amount of time.

    a part of the population to the new feature, but unlike A/B Testing, the new feature
    can and is typically a completely new feature and not just a small tweak of an
    existing one. The purpose is different too. A/B Testing looks to improve the product
    performance in terms of getting business outcomes, while the Canary Release is
    focused entirely on technical performance.

    to a subset of end users and then captures their behaviors and feedback. They
    enable the team to understand the real-life impact of these new features, which
    may be unexpected for users in the sense that no users asked for them. It is one
    of the last steps for validating a product/market fit for new features. Rather
    than launching the features to your entire group of users at once, this method
    allows you to test the waters to make sure your application works as planned before
    you go live.

    a subset of the users. They allow the team to build a better understanding of
    the impact created by the new feature and the ways the users would interact with
    it. Often novel ways of interaction can surface, ways that were not initially
    envisioned by the team. This can be both positive and negative, and the limited
    availability allows the team to draw conclusions from the real-life use and decide
    if the feature will be made widely available, further developed, or discontinued.

    borrow from them. There was no ability to add a deposit or specify a term length
    to see how it would reflect repayment rates or lending criteria. The calculator
    was also very slow and clunky, not mobile-friendly or responsive. The quick solution
    for the bank was to just reskin it to make these cosmetic fixes, but this didn''t
    really help answer the question of why were they getting hundreds of people doing
    the calculation but only a tiny percentage of those people continuing to apply
    for a loan.'

    and a Product Owner. As a small co-located team, buried in the heart of the bank,
    we were able to move fast! We interviewed people who had recently purchased mortgages
    with the bank to get insight into their motivations for using the tool. We did
    a load of research by going into the bank branches and asking people open-ended
    questions while they used the existing tool. We collated this information along
    with how they were accessing the calculator and if they were to complete an application,
    what device they would use,that is, their phone or their laptop.

    interested in *How much could I borrow* but *How much house can I afford.* This
    simple difference might seem inconsequential but it massively affected how we
    rebuilt the bank's online mortgage calculator. It meant people wanted to be able
    to tailor their calculation to see how their rates and lending criteria could
    be affected by, for example, having more income. Or, if they were to continue
    to save for another year and have more of a deposit saved, could they get a better
    rate? This flip meant people were using the tool to not see if they could afford
    a given home but how much of a home could they afford and by when.

    with a new skin that ran on a mobile – but this would not have addressed the core
    problem. By reframing the question, we were now in a position to create a simple
    calculator tailored to the needs of the bank's first-time buyers.

    all of the information captured in Discovery practices and push it through these
    tools. We also showed how using some helpful practices to look at the same information
    with slightly different lenses –Impact versus Effort Prioritization and How/Now/Wow
    Prioritization – can help improve Value Slicing. Where proposed feature areas
    would benefit from a deeper dive to understand the value, we recommended the Design
    Sprint as an option.

    by value and how this produces a living, breathing artifact that will be subject
    to continuous Product Backlog Refinement as we gather more learning, feedback,
    and metrics for our delivery. The economic prioritization model WSJF, which is
    based on Cost of Delay, provides a repeatable and quantifiable tool to drive this.
    It's one of many prioritization tools that can help the Product Ownership function
    work smoothly and effectively.

    taken when designing experiments and how platforms such as OpenShift enable powerful
    evidence-based testing to be conducted in production with users. A/B Testing,
    Blue/Green Deployments, Canary Releases, Dark Launches, and Feature Flags were
    all introduced from a business perspective. We will return to the implementation
    details of these in *Section 6, Build It, Run It, Own It* and explore how we interpret
    the measures from them in *Section 7, Improve It, Sustain It.*

    delivery and where and when it is applicable according to levels of complexity
    and simplicity. We'll also look at Waterfall and the relative merits and where
    it might be appropriate. We'll explore different agile frameworks out there and
    how all of them relate to the Open Practice Library and Mobius Loop. We'll explore
    the importance of visualization and of capturing measurements and learning during
    our iterations of the Delivery Loop.
