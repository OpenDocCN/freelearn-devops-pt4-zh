			<p>In <em class="italics">Section 4</em>, <em class="italics">Prioritize It</em>, we moved through the Options Pivot for the first time. We took all of the learning and ideas that can come out of the practices used on the Discovery Loop and applied more practices to organize them according to their value. We used prioritization techniques to help us slice value and considered how to plan and design experiments that could be run by making use of advanced deployment capabilities offered by the OpenShift platform.</p>
			<p>As outlined in the <em class="italics">Mobius Outcome Delivery QuickStart Guide</em> by Gabrielle Benefield and <a id="_idIndexMarker1614"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1615"/>Ryan Shriver (freely available to download from <a href="http://mobiusloop.com">mobiusloop.com</a>), Mobius encourages product development through the use of continuous discovery, validation, and learning. Building products this way requires a strong foundation of culture and technical practices that enable an ongoing experimental fast release and fast feedback approach. Indeed, ongoing research and experiments are just as much part of product development as feature delivery.</p>
			<p>The key differences between research, experimentation, and implementation are the investments in time and money required to steer a team toward building the right thing that is aligned with the target outcomes. Mobius encourages the idea of delivering maximum value from the least amount of investment.</p>

			<p>As we move onto the Delivery Loop, we're going to carry out research, execute experiments, and implement features. How are we going to do this? Are we going to use a framework like Scrum, or <strong class="bold">Scaled Agile Framework</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAFe</strong>), or <strong class="bold">Large-Scale Scrum Framework</strong> (<strong class="bold">LeSS</strong>), or Lean? Are we going to follow a prescriptive approach or methodology? No, we are not! As has been the case throughout this book—indeed, as is the mindset behind Mobius and the Open Practice Library—we are going to offer a toolbox of practices that will help you work your way around the Delivery Loop. We will not say there is one right way to do things because it does not exist. Our approach is to adapt based on context, learning, and experience. We will look at some of the popular practices that we have found to be very effective and share some stories and tips behind them.</p>
			<p>Which practices you choose is up to you but, in nearly all cases, we strongly recommend using practices that allow fast delivery, rapid feedback, and continuous learning throughout. </p>
			<p>To this effect, this section is divided into two chapters. <em class="italics">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italics">Doing Delivery</em>, is all about Doing Delivery—the difference between Waterfall and Agile approaches and popular Agile practices to incrementally and iteratively deliver. <em class="italics">Chapter 13</em>, <em class="italics">Measure and Learn</em>, is all about measuring metrics and learning about what they tell us. We can use the many different flavors of metrics, applied to the small incremental deliveries, to continually improve.</p>
