    first time. We took all of the learning and ideas that can come out of the practices
    used on the Discovery Loop and applied more practices to organize them according
    to their value. We used prioritization techniques to help us slice value and considered
    how to plan and design experiments that could be run by making use of advanced
    deployment capabilities offered by the OpenShift platform.

- en: As outlined in the *Mobius Outcome Delivery QuickStart Guide* by Gabrielle Benefield
    and Ryan Shriver (freely available to download from [mobiusloop.com](http://mobiusloop.com)),
    Mobius encourages product development through the use of continuous discovery,
    validation, and learning. Building products this way requires a strong foundation
    of culture and technical practices that enable an ongoing experimental fast release
    and fast feedback approach. Indeed, ongoing research and experiments are just
    as much part of product development as feature delivery.

    the investments in time and money required to steer a team toward building the
    right thing that is aligned with the target outcomes. Mobius encourages the idea
    of delivering maximum value from the least amount of investment.

- en: As we move onto the Delivery Loop, we're going to carry out research, execute
    experiments, and implement features. How are we going to do this? Are we going
    to use a framework like Scrum, or **Scaled Agile Framework** (**SAFe**), or **Large-Scale
    Scrum Framework** (**LeSS**), or Lean? Are we going to follow a prescriptive approach
    or methodology? No, we are not! As has been the case throughout this book—indeed,
    as is the mindset behind Mobius and the Open Practice Library—we are going to
    offer a toolbox of practices that will help you work your way around the Delivery
    Loop. We will not say there is one right way to do things because it does not
    exist. Our approach is to adapt based on context, learning, and experience. We
    will look at some of the popular practices that we have found to be very effective
    and share some stories and tips behind them.

    recommend using practices that allow fast delivery, rapid feedback, and continuous
    learning throughout.

    Delivery*, is all about Doing Delivery—the difference between Waterfall and Agile
    approaches and popular Agile practices to incrementally and iteratively deliver.
    *Chapter 13*, *Measure and Learn*, is all about measuring metrics and learning
    about what they tell us. We can use the many different flavors of metrics, applied
    to the small incremental deliveries, to continually improve.
