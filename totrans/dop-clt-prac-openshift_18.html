			<p>Ultimately, code has no value until it is delivered to production and its associated functionalities are in use. It's time to connect all our learning to date to delivery.</p>&#13;
			<p>We are well into the second half of this book and other than setting up a technical foundation, as we did in <em class="italics">Section 3</em>, <em class="italics">Discover It</em>. we haven't written any application code, nor have we delivered anything yet. What we have done is go through a tremendous set of practices to help discover, set outcomes, assess and prioritize options, and decide what we are going to deliver next. Now, we have reached the point where we will write some code, deliver features, execute experiments, and learn from further research.</p>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, we are going to look at different delivery approaches. Your immediate expectation might be that this chapter is going to be all about <strong class="bold">Agile</strong> and that using Agile methodologies is now the only way to deliver working software. However, in addition to taking a look at Agile, where it came from, and different ways we can use it, we will highlight that it is not the only option. There is still a place for more traditional approaches to delivery, such as <strong class="bold">Waterfall</strong>. In this chapter, we will:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>Explain the Waterfall and Agile methodologies.</li>&#13;
				<li>Look at the difference between complicated, complex, and clear systems and how we can use them to drive the applicability of Agile.</li>&#13;
				<li>Explore how the Mobius Loop is framework-agnostic and, through different perspectives, speed, and frequency of iterations, can be used to explain delivery of every type.</li>&#13;
				<li>Share some tools and tips about getting <strong class="bold">ready</strong> for Delivery Iterations.</li>&#13;
				<li>Describe the practices with examples we often use to help with Delivery Iterations; including, for example, Iteration (or Sprint) Planning, Daily Stand-Ups, Showcases, and Retrospectives. </li>&#13;
				<li>See how, as teams mature and continuously improve, they can adapt their working practices and approaches.</li>&#13;
				<li>Share some tools and tips about getting working software features <strong class="bold">done</strong> with a focus on both functional and non-functional acceptance.</li>&#13;
				<li>See, for the first time, how all of our practices blend together to give us a continuous delivery engine.</li>&#13;

			<p class="figure">Figure 12.1: Waterfall and Agile teams</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's start by having a look at those two phenomena—Waterfall and Agile. As depicted in <em class="italics">Figure 12.1</em>, Waterfall is often associated with Gantt charts, dependencies, and hand-offs and hand-overs from one part of the organization to another. Agile takes a different mindset and is more cross-functional. Some may say Waterfall is old and dying. We'll see later in this chapter that there remain valid use cases for taking a Waterfall approach.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-259">W<a id="_idTextAnchor295"/><a id="_idTextAnchor296"/>aterfall</h2>&#13;
			<p>Waterfall projects are broken <a id="_idIndexMarker1616"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1617"/>down into linear steps; each step relies on the previous one being completed before starting the next. The first step is to gather user requirements, followed by designing and planning, and then finally software development. Once testing and deployment are done, we enter the maintenance and operation mode.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer379" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 12.2: Waterfall process</p>&#13;
			<p>This type of delivery methodology has a long history outside of software development, especially in traditional engineering. When building a bridge or a factory, the <em class="italics">project plan</em> lays out the requirement of all the people, resources, tasks, and timelines for the overall project of work. The Waterfall approach can be described as a <em class="italics">plan-driven</em> engineering process where success is measured according to how well development is able to keep up with the plan.</p>&#13;
			<p>By following a plan, individual variations are minimized. In the industrial world, this helps make both delivery and cost predictable. Because the traditional Waterfall model does not allow for looping, requirements and design are gathered in vast documents to begin planning. Changing and understanding the documents becomes very tricky for teams because there are no mechanisms for getting a shared understanding other than reading all the documents over again. Have you ever participated in a book review session? How many <a id="_idIndexMarker1618"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1619"/>different points of view do you get when a group of people reads the same book? Coupling this with the likeliness of an organization to raise expensive change requests and making changes to the documentation can quickly show how disastrous this approach can be for a company. So how does this method fare in the world of software?</p>&#13;
			<p>Often, we find that in the software realm the requirements do not match what the end users expect. This is because as we develop the software, questions and misunderstandings about the original requirements and design become hard to address. As design and business requirement teams are not heavily involved in the development phase, there is no opportunity to refresh the designs or ideas.</p>&#13;
			<p>Delivering customer and business value through working software takes a lot longer using Waterfall—as working software is only delivered toward the end of a Waterfall process. Think of how much time is lost while you're waiting for your great application to arrive. What if it never arrives? Or worse, arrives too late and you've missed your market?</p>&#13;
			<p>Changing requirements during a Waterfall execution is often left to another Waterfall phase. If changes are urgent, then they may be handled through some form of change request mechanism. However, this is really a form of loop—leading us to a more iterative approach. In Waterfall, these loops can still be very time-consuming and costly. If only there was a quicker way!</p>&#13;
			<p>Winston Walker Royce was an American computer scientist and director at Lockheed Software Technology Center in Austin, Texas. He was a pioneer in the field of software development, known for his 1970 paper from which the idea of the single-pass Waterfall model for software development was mistakenly drawn. That's right, Waterfall was misunderstood and mistaken!</p>&#13;

			<p>Ba<a id="_idTextAnchor297"/><a id="_idTextAnchor298"/>rry Boehm wrote in 1987: "<em class="italics">Royce's 1970 paper is generally considered to be the paper which defined the </em><em class="italics"><a id="_idIndexMarker1620"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1621"/></em><em class="italics">stagewise Waterfall model of the software process. But it is surprising to see that both the earlier Benington </em><em class="italics"><a id="_idIndexMarker1622"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1623"/></em><em class="italics">and Hosier papers had good approximations to the Waterfall model, and that Royce's paper already incorporates prototyping as an essential step compatible with the Waterfall model</em>."<span id="footnote-071-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-071">1</a></span></p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<p>Roy<a id="_idTextAnchor299"/><a id="_idTextAnchor300"/>ce demonstrated <a id="_idIndexMarker1624"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1625"/>that while the development of large software systems required a more thorough approach, there was an inherent risk in the single-pass sequential approach. He proposed an iterative approach and advocated that projects should pass through this at least twice. But many Waterfall projects started and have continued to follow just a single-pass flow, left to right, with just a single iteration, which was not intended or recommended by Royce—Waterfall plans were never supposed to be executed just once. </p>&#13;
			<p>The Waterfall model did help in the innovation of other approaches and the focus on iteration was corrected in Agile models.</p>&#13;

			<p>Agile development methods have been talked about and practiced for over two decades now. The <em class="italics">Agile Manifesto</em> came<a id="_idIndexMarker1626"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1627"/> about when a<a id="_idIndexMarker1628"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1629"/> bunch of men, all prominent in software development, got together at a ski retreat in Utah to do some critical analysis on why IT projects were getting such a bad name. They looked back at the previous 10 years of software delivery throughout the '90s and concluded IT projects were taking too long to execute, coming over budget, and often not delivering value to end users. So these men sat down at the end of their trip and wrote the <em class="italics">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>We know what you're thinking: this manifesto thing must have been a massive document! A huge book filled with detailed instructions on how to write software as well as how to manage requirements and costs. In fact, it was much simpler than this—so simple you could almost fit it in a tweet!</p>&#13;

			<p>The Agile Manifesto<span id="footnote-070-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-070">2</a></span> is a simple set of values, highlighting the importance of some values over others.</p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<p><em class="italics">Working software over comprehensive documentation</em>—<em class="italics">This sounds great, I don't have to write any documentation</em> is what some are probably thinking. But they would be wrong. The values are not saying things on the right are not important, but that there is higher value in the items on the left. This is the bit people tend to forget when quoting the manifesto.</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			&#13;
			<p>In addition to this set of values, this group came up with a set of 12 principles<span id="footnote-069-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-069">3</a></span> to support them. </p>&#13;

			<p>These principles<a id="_idIndexMarker1630"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1631"/> provide more detail about the kind of behaviors they foresaw as <em class="italics">being agile</em>. Read together, the principles provide an incredibly useful resource when having conversations about what it means to be <em class="italics">agile</em>. Agile these days has really become an overused buzzword and is frequently injected into sentences. Examples include—"<em class="italics">We're going to use Agile to deliver this project</em>" or "<em class="italics">We're going to install Agile</em>." Reading through and having a conversation about the 12 statements can provide clarity and alignment on what we mean by Agile.</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p>The Agile Manifesto contrasts with the plan-driven <a id="_idIndexMarker1632"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1633"/>Waterfall approach in that it:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>Is more <em class="italics">adaptive</em>, rather than <em class="italics">prescriptive</em>.</li>&#13;
				<li>Is more <em class="italics">people-oriented</em>, rather than <em class="italics">process-oriented</em>.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>At the beginning of the industrial age, people working on the factory floor were described by Frederick Taylor, an American <a id="_idIndexMarker1634"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1635"/>mechanical engineer widely known for his methods to improve industrial efficiency, as being <em class="italics">lazy</em>, <em class="italics">venal</em>, and <em class="italics">stupid</em>. A factory was built and designed by architects and engineers who did not work on the factory floor. One of the tenets of Agile is that the people and teams who do the work decide on how it gets done.</p>&#13;
			<p>An important part of<a id="_idIndexMarker1636"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1637"/> Agile is its focus on cross-functional teams delivering working software. The designers and business stakeholders are continuously involved in this process. Unlike Waterfall, when questions arise about the end user experience, these can be researched and answered based on the most up-to-date information available to the team.</p>&#13;
			<p>Agile methodologies focus on simultaneous workflows that form a baseline to help us control change. Plans are constantly revised to reflect the learnings during a product's development. Success is based on the value delivered by the working software.</p>&#13;
			<p>Agile is focused around products that are directly connected to the end user as opposed to effort and output that may not be directly connected. The team comes together to drive successful delivery where processes and tools are used to optimize product delivery.</p>&#13;
			<p>One of the most noticeable traits of Agile is its <a id="_idIndexMarker1638"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1639"/>breaking down of project delivery into smaller iterative phases. This works really well for software products that require regular revisions and testing. Because the work is done incrementally, teams can easily adjust what is being worked on. They can pivot to work on high-value features and deliver those to customers early and fast.</p>&#13;
			<p>Some critics of Agile methods quite rightly point out that Agile projects also fail. However, it is not methodologies that fail, it is teams and organizations that fail. Often the reasons can be clearly articulated as the team taking on too much <em class="italics">technical debt</em>—adding new<a id="_idIndexMarker1640"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1641"/> features or changing existing software is just too hard to do quickly because the code base is a mess, or the architecture is just plain wrong.</p>&#13;
			<p>Fundamentally, Agile is an ideology or a philosophy—a way of thinking. It is articulated by the four value statements in the Agile Manifesto and defined further by the twelve principles. Agile is instantiated and brought to life by a series of practices, many of which are in the Open Practice Library. Practices have been grouped together to form popular Agile <a id="_idIndexMarker1642"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1643"/>frameworks such as Scrum, Kanban, and <strong class="bold">SAFe</strong> (<strong class="bold">Scaled Agile Framework</strong>). All of these make up the Agile ecosystem.</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure">Figure 12.6: Decomposing the Agile mindset into values, principles, practices, and frameworks</p>&#13;
			<p>Before we get into the detail of Agile, let's <a id="_idIndexMarker1644"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1645"/>consider how OpenShift complements Agile and promotes business agility.</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;
						<h2 id="_idParaDest-261" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor304"/>How Does OpenShift Help?</h2>&#13;
			<p>Technology is one of the foundational pillars that makes Agile productive and responsive to change. OpenShift <a id="_idIndexMarker1646"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1647"/>is the collaborative platform that allows team members with diverse sets of skills to come together to securely write, test, deliver, and operate their application software. The platform enhances team dynamics, as team members can quickly and easily work in a homogenous environment—they are not forced to work in isolation. The ability to run simultaneous workflow streams in separate OpenShift projects fits extremely well with Agile delivery. Different clusters can be used to isolate production from non-production workloads. While each environment may be sized differently, they are identical in their software makeup. This drives up quality by eliminating version and configuration drift across environments.</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>As we mentioned in the introduction, we still see a place for less Agile approaches to delivery (including the use of Waterfall). Let us now look at the characteristics of different projects that can determine what approach is best.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-262"><a id="_idTextAnchor305"/>Decision-Making Contexts</h2>&#13;
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor306"/>In 2020, Red Hat produced an eBook entitled <em class="italics">Transformation takes practice</em>.<span id="footnote-068-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-068">4</a></span> This was written in response to a question asked time and again by business leaders: Why are so many digital transformation <a id="_idIndexMarker1648"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1649"/>efforts failing? In the eBook, Mike Walker, Global Director of Red Hat Open Innovation Labs explains: "<em class="italics">In complex sociotechnical systems, it is a group of people, not individuals or managers, who can create innovative change. These groups must tune the system through a perpetual cycle of probing, sensing, and responding to outcomes</em>."</p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<p>To explore that cycle of <strong class="bold">probing, sensing, and responding </strong>to outcomes, let's introduce a very helpful framework that compares this approach to alternative approaches used in different systems.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-263"><a id="_idTextAnchor307"/><a id="_idTextAnchor308"/>The Cynefin Framework</h3>&#13;
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Cynefin framework</strong> was <a id="_idIndexMarker1650"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1651"/>created in 1999 by Dave Snowden when he worked for IBM Global Services. <em class="italics">Cynefin</em> is the Welsh word for <em class="italics">habitat</em>, and the framework offers five decision-making contexts or <a id="_idIndexMarker1652"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1653"/><em class="italics">domains</em>:</p>&#13;

			<p>The <em class="italics">complicated</em> domain consists of the <em class="italics">known unknowns</em>.

			&#13;
			<p>M<a id="_idTextAnchor309"/>ost of the work we do with our customers sits in the complex and complicated domains.

For organizations pursuing digital transformation, one key step is recognizing the difference between complicated and complex systems. Think of a Ferrari. It is made of thousands of components, but their sum and how each interacts with the other to create the whole are fundamentally knowable. Diagnosing and repairing a malfunctioning Ferrari requires you to sense, analyze, and respond to feedback and learning. A Ferrari is a complicated system.</p>&#13;

			<p>Now think of a rainforest. It is a dynamic ecosystem with billions of interacting organisms and elements. We understand those dynamics at some level, but they are essentially unpredictable, with cause and effect only evident in hindsight. The problems threatening rainforests would be best addressed through probing, sensing, and responding. In other words, it requires continuous cycles of hypotheses, experimentation, and measurement to arrive at desired outcomes. A rainforest is a complex system.</p>&#13;
			<p>Today's large organizations behave <a id="_idIndexMarker1660"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1661"/>more like rainforests, not Ferraris. It is a complex sociotechnical system with many dynamics—both human and technical—at play, that resist quantification. This distinction is important because many enterprise leaders assume organizations are complicated systems in which analysis is the key to arriving at the best solution. But in complex systems, probing and sensing, or hypothesis and experimentation, in rapid and iterative cycles, are more effective in identifying the best solutions and ideas.</p>&#13;
			<p>What has all this got to do with the delivery of applications such as the case study used throughout this book, PetBattle? There is a lot of terminology attached to delivery methodologies. When do we use Scrum versus Kanban? Is a Burndown chart just a reverse Gantt chart? How can we show value being delivered when using Waterfall? Ultimately, each method or approach is trying to achieve a similar goal: the completion of a feature set in any given product that can be released to our end users.</p>&#13;
			<p>Some good starting guidelines when trying to understand which methodology to use include the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>Waterfall <a id="_idIndexMarker1662"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1663"/>works best for projects that are completed in a linear fashion, where it is clear to <em class="italics">sense-categorize-respond</em> as best practice. So, following a standard operating procedure to install and test a software product will be a one-time-only piece of work and will not benefit from agility or iteration. There will be no need to go back to prior phases of work. This is often seen as a traditional way of working. </li>&#13;
				<li>An iterative Agile framework <a id="_idIndexMarker1664"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1665"/>such as Scrum is concerned with getting work done by completing and showing small increments of work and inspecting and adapting to feedback. In other words, we are taking the <em class="italics">probe-sense-respond</em> approach articulated in the complex domain of Cynefin. Other <a id="_idIndexMarker1666"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1667"/>Agile frameworks such as Kanban are primarily concerned with continuous delivery. The highest priority item is done next, and a fixed chunk of work is pulled off the backlog into a smaller stream of work. This also supports the <em class="italics">probe-sense-respond</em> mindset.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Let's get back to our visualization and mental model that we have been using throughout the book using the Mobius Loop.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-265">W<a id="_idTextAnchor313"/><a id="_idTextAnchor314"/>hen Does a Mobius Loop Mindset Make Sense?</h3>&#13;
			<p>One of the reasons we love the Mobius Loop is because we can use it to explain any project, program, or work we've ever been involved in.</p>&#13;
			<p>As it is framework-agnostic, it does <a id="_idIndexMarker1668"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1669"/>not demand Scrum or Kanban. It does not stipulate how many iterations a team or organization should go through, around one or both of the loops. It complies with any of the four established domains of Cynefin.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 12.8: The Cynefin framework and Mobius Loop</p>&#13;
			<p>Projects in the <strong class="bold">complex</strong> domain fit well with an Agile approach. Visualized on the Mobius Loop, this means starting on the Discovery Loop and establishing the first set of Target Outcomes. The Options Pivot involves refining what to discover or deliver next and deciding on which options to deliver. The Delivery Loop creates a design and build for a small increment, runs that increment in production to collect data, and takes measurements before learning and reflecting on the outcomes achieved. There is then an adaption point to either go through another loop of Discovery, do another loop of Delivery, or return to the Options Pivot to reprioritize and pivot. This cycle will continue indefinitely as long as there are product delivery and/or operations ongoing. There will be a growing desire, through continuous improvement, to speed up the iterations of Discovery and Delivery.</p>&#13;
			<p>Projects in the <strong class="bold">complicated</strong> domain fit well with an <strong class="bold">Agile</strong> approach. Visualized on the Mobius Loop, this means starting on the Discovery Loop and establishing Target Outcomes. This may be slower and more detailed, given projects in the complicated domain benefit from sense and analysis before a response. A similar pattern will be experienced for complex projects through Options into Delivery and then either a return to Discovery, Delivery, or Options. </p>&#13;
			<p>Finally, projects in the <strong class="bold">chaos</strong><strong class="bold"><a id="_idIndexMarker1670"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1671"/></strong> domain need to act quickly and move out of that domain as quickly as possible. That <a id="_idIndexMarker1672"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1673"/>may mean starting on the Delivery Loop with the urgent act and, as the level of chaos reduces, start to re-group and organize options and a loop of Discovery. Once the shift to the Discovery Loop is completed, the project moves from one of chaos to more of a complex project. Most application development these days would be considered complex.</p>&#13;
			<p>So<a id="_idTextAnchor315"/><a id="_idTextAnchor316"/>, where does an application like PetBattle sit in the Cynefin framework, and what is the best delivery approach to consider?</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-266" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor317"/>PetBattle—Complex, Complicated, or Clear?</h2>&#13;
			<p>Our PetBattle customers cannot use any of our innovative feature ideas until we build, test, and deploy our code into a production environment. The old hobbyist application was built all in one go and one release. Should the new PetBattle organization continue this approach?</p>&#13;
			<p>The team walked the walls of all the artifacts produced during their Discovery Loop and options. They talked about what might be the best way to deliver all these great ideas. Some of the comments made during this session include:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>During the Discovery Loop explained in <em class="italics">Section 3, Discover It</em>, we only really explored in any depth a small subset of feature ideas, that is, those connected to the <em class="italics">Increase Site Engagement for Uploaders</em> part of the Impact Map. That was where the investors invested most of their Donal Dollars! We'll eventually need to consider other impacts or dive deeper into this one when we see what happens with our early feature builds. </li>&#13;
				<li>There are a lot of pink sticky notes on the Event Storm—these represent questions, assumptions, and other unknowns that we'll need to get answers to and eventually remove.</li>&#13;
				<li>The Event Storming done to date has focused on <em class="italics">the one where Mary enters the daily tournament and wins a prize</em>. We'll need to do more Event Storming as we <a id="_idIndexMarker1674"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1675"/>consider new features and/or answers to the unknowns.</li>&#13;
				<li>We have some good target outcomes and some great hypothesis statements behind all the options. But what if the needle doesn't shift and those hypotheses are proven false? We'll be back to the drawing board.</li>&#13;
				<li>When we refined our options in <em class="italics">Section 4, Prioritize It</em>, on the Value Slice board, we identified several experiments we need to run. Some will be run as A/B tests, feature toggles, and canary launches, while some require UI prototyping and technical spikes to run before we can progress.</li>&#13;
				<li>The Empathy Map we produced from interviewing Mary was great. But it showed how many things we hadn't thought of about our users. What will happen when we Empathy Map other users? Or, when we start to meet advertisers and partners and capture Empathy Maps on them? What will they say?</li>&#13;
				<li>There remain a lot of technical unknowns and learning to be done on the platform.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>There are many known unknowns and probably even more unknown unknowns! With so many unknowns, how do we deliver these changes in a way that ensures quality (no breakages to a PetBattle Tournament!), speed (can the team deliver changes quickly and on time?), and efficiency (can the team repeatedly deploy changes cheaply and easily)?</p>&#13;
<p>PetBattle, like most user-centric applications, is a complex sociotechnical system with many dynamics, both human and technical. With continued emergent practice, we can now move to a <em class="italics">probe-sense-respond</em> mindset as we approach our first (of many) iterations of delivery.</p>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
				&#13;
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor318"/>Taking a complex product into the first iteration of delivery means we have to decide what, from our list of options, we are going to deliver first. We also need to check whether the team are ready to work on the selected items and are confident they have the right amount of information and understanding to deliver them. This leads to another foundational practice to define and assess readiness to deliver.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-267"><a id="_idTextAnchor319"/>The Definition of Ready</h2>&#13;
			<p>Jeff Sutherland, co-creator of the <a id="_idIndexMarker1676"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1677"/>Scrum framework, called out that one of the main reasons that many <a id="_idIndexMarker1678"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1679"/>Scrum projects fail is due to teams working on items that are simply not ready to be worked on. They are either too ambiguous, not understood by business and technical stakeholders, too big, or they lack ambiguity as to the scope of the item in question.</p>&#13;
			<p>Many teams have chosen to adopt the practice of having a <strong class="bold">Definition of Ready</strong> to mitigate this risk. The Definition of Done practice has been popular with Agile teams for many years—we will explore that later in this chapter. The Definition of Ready has been less utilized. A good way to look at this, like every practice in the Open Practice Library, is as a tool that can be taken out of the toolbox to address a problem. If a team is struggling to get work done because of ambiguity and a lack of shared understanding before even starting it, adding a Definition of Ready may improve the team's success in the future.</p>&#13;
			<p>The Definition of Ready is a practice used by a team to set their criteria and expectations with others as to what constitutes a Product Backlog item that is ready to be worked on. The resulting artifact is collaboratively created, maintained, and enforced by the team, and publicly displayed for the team members and others to easily reference. It is often informed by experience, like all other artifacts generated from the practices in this book. It is a living, breathing artifact that will improve over time with learning and experience. We often find discussions that happen during Retrospectives lead to improvements being made to the Definition of Ready. For example, when a team gets blocked and does not manage to deliver the items they pulled into their sprint, they might ask themselves what they could have done differently to prevent the items from getting blocked in the sprint. If there is a common pattern emerging and an improvement process that can be put in place to prepare future items ready for delivery sprints, the criteria can be written as a Definition of Ready criteria.</p>&#13;
			<p>The Definition of Ready often starts with the act of writing user stories and/or acceptance criteria. When we look at Product Backlog items, they are often quite high-level, for example, <strong class="bold">Log In</strong>, <strong class="bold">Choose Item</strong>, <strong class="bold">Submit Order.</strong> At first glance, you might think these items are clear in scope and could be delivered according to expectation. However, a few simple <a id="_idIndexMarker1680"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1681"/>questions from a Development Team member opens up the world of ambiguity that exists:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>When you say log in, do you mean log in with a username and password?</li>&#13;
				<li>What happens if I don't have a username registered?</li>&#13;
				<li>What happens if I put in the wrong password?</li>&#13;
				<li>What should happen immediately after I log in?</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The practice of writing user stories has become very popular with Agile teams because it turns a feature idea into a conversation (or, at least, a promise to create a conversation).</p>&#13;
			<p>Mike Cohn of Mountain Goat Software has driven the popularity of user stories and explains how the practice helps us <em class="italics">shift the focus from writing about requirements to talking about them. All Agile user stories include a written sentence or two and, more importantly, a series of conversations about the desired functionality</em>.<span id="footnote-059-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-059">13</a></span></p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<p>User stories tend to follow the template: as a &lt;type of user&gt;, I want &lt;some goal&gt; so that &lt;some reason&gt;.</p>&#13;
			<p>So, after some brief conversation <a id="_idIndexMarker1682"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1683"/>between the Development Team members, business stakeholders, and the Product Ownership, the <strong class="bold">Log In</strong> feature could be re-written as, "<em class="italics">as a retail banking customer, I want to log in with my username and correct password so that I can be presented with my latest bank balance.</em>" The conversation may also have driven the splitting of this feature into several other user stories that focus on how to get a username/password, what should happen if incorrect credentials are supplied, other information and options available after logging in, what other types of customers should be able to see and do, and so on.</p>&#13;
			<p>The user story practice facilitates three outcomes, also known as the three Cs:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li>It generates a <strong class="bold">Card</strong>—the user story is short enough that it can be written on a small index card (or a digital equivalent).</li>&#13;
				<li>It generates a <strong class="bold">Conversation</strong>—both in writing this user story and capturing unknowns or further clarifications needed, yet provides enough direction for working on the item.</li>&#13;
				<li>It provides <strong class="bold">Confirmation</strong> of the scope and expectation of this individual item that will deliver a small piece of value to the end user.</li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div id="footnote-059" class="_idFootnote" epub:type="footnote">&#13;
				<p class="FootNote"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-059-backlink">13</a>	<a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories">https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories</a></p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>The INVEST criteria is a good pattern to check against user stories.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer386" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/B16297_12_09.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 12.9: INVEST criteria</p>&#13;
			<p>You'll notice that the act of re-writing a feature as a user story helped answer some of the example questions, but not all of them. While we could write many user stories simply to answer every <a id="_idIndexMarker1684"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1685"/>question a developer might have, this may result in them being too granular and developers grouping them together to write code. So, a second popular practice to prepare items for delivery is the act <a id="_idIndexMarker1686"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1687"/>of writing acceptance criteria.</p>&#13;
			<p>Acceptance criteria is a further elaboration of understanding and often written on the back of the index card holding a user story. Acceptance criteria are the conditions of satisfaction a Product Owner and stakeholders will have when the item has been completed. These are low-level binary points of clarification — basically, a checkbox list that the Product Owner may go through to convince themselves that a feature has been delivered to meet business expectations. So, some <a id="_idIndexMarker1688"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1689"/>acceptance criteria for our <strong class="bold">Log In</strong> feature may include the following:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>There is a textbox for username and password.</li>&#13;
				<li>Beneath, there is a hyperlink to create a new username.</li>&#13;
				<li>The username will be displayed in plain text when typed in.</li>&#13;
				<li>The password will be masked with asterisks when typed in.</li>&#13;
				<li>If the username/password is correct, the Customer Details page will be presented with the bank balance at the top of the page.</li>&#13;
				<li>If the username/password is incorrect, an error message will appear.</li>&#13;
				<li>If an incorrect password is entered three times in a 15-minute period, the session will be locked out for a further 15 minutes.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			&#13;
			<p>Each of these items represents small, standalone tests (which can be automated). They are specific to the functionality being built. Later in this chapter, we'll show how another practice, the Definition of Done, is used to drive other types of testing.</p>&#13;
			<p>The act of writing <a id="_idIndexMarker1690"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1691"/>user stories and acceptance criteria helps generate shared understanding across all team <a id="_idIndexMarker1692"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1693"/>members, Product Owners, and stakeholders. They are often practices used in Product Backlog Refinement sessions, which were discussed in the previous chapter.</p>&#13;
			<p>If a team sees the value in these practices, they may choose to add them to their Definition of Ready so that they always go through the motions of writing user stories and acceptance criteria for a Product Backlog item, so that it will be ready to be worked on. If an item does not have acceptance criteria, it is NOT ready and the team either needs to do some refinement and write the acceptance criteria, or demote the item on the Product Backlog and find alternative items that are ready.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now, it's important to call out some misuses and problems that can come about through having a Definition of Ready. First, this is not an opportunity to introduce lots of pre-development phase gates. Definitions of Ready should not be about writing long specifications, having design documents signed off, having architectural review board approvals, and so on. The Definition of Ready is about giving the team the confidence that, if they take some work into a Delivery Iteration, they will get it done.</p>&#13;
			<p>Secondly, the Definition of Ready is not a mandatory practice for teams. Like all practices in this book, it is a tool that is useful to try and, if the team does experience problems with getting work out of the Delivery Iterations they take in, it would be recommended to try using the Definition of Ready practice.</p>&#13;
			<p>When we look at a team's Definition of Ready, we look for statements that are focused on the team and their comfort or confidence, as these are clearly the criteria that bring the team to the fore.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's look at the Definition of Ready criteria our PetBattle team put in place.</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-268" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor320"/>PetBattle – Definition of Ready</h2>&#13;
			<p>The PetBattle team met a few days before their first Delivery Iteration. They looked at the Product Backlog that had emerged from Value Slice and Discovery Loop practices. There was clearly some discomfort and misalignment in exactly what the feature was going to deliver and involve. So, the team booked a series of 40-minute Product Backlog Refinement sessions.</p>&#13;
			<p>During the first session, they brainstormed their Definition of Ready and agreed this would be used in all future Product Backlog Refinement sessions to validate and assure that they would be ready to work on an item.</p>&#13;
			<p>The Definition of Ready included:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">The team has written and agreed on acceptance criteria with the Product Owner and, where it makes sense, business or technical stakeholders.</li>&#13;
				<li>The team feels the item can be delivered within a few days of development.</li>&#13;
				<li>The team has collectively sized the item using a relative sizing technique.</li>&#13;
				<li>The team understands where the item fits into the existing or emergent architecture.</li>&#13;
				<li>The team has seen and has access to UI and technical research.</li>&#13;
				<li>Any dependencies identified by the team to complete the item have been satisfied or the team is confident that they can be satisfied within the iteration.</li>&#13;
				<li>The team sees the value in doing this work.</li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>The team agreed that they would regularly use the Fist of Five confidence vote or Roman vote to assess their comfort and confidence levels for the seven points above. They were unified in that they should never take items into a Delivery Iteration that were not ready. They would need lots of short Product Backlog Refinement sessions to keep the top backlog items ready.</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>To discuss the Definition of <a id="_idIndexMarker1694"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1695"/>Ready with the wider community or to read more information or even improve the practice, have a look at the Open Practice Library page at <a href="https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/definition-of-ready/">https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/definition-of-ready/</a>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now we have some items <strong class="bold">ready</strong> to be delivered, let's look at the most popular Agile framework used for iterative delivery, Scrum. </p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-269"><a id="_idTextAnchor321"/><a id="_idTextAnchor322"/>Scrum</h2>&#13;
			<p>When you hear someone say that they are now doing agile, their team is using agile, or their organization has adopted agile, there's a very strong chance that what they are actually doing is some form of Scrum.</p>&#13;
			<p>Scrum is not the <a id="_idIndexMarker1696"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1697"/>same as agile. As mentioned earlier, Agile is an ideology. It is underpinned by those values and principles set out in the Agile Manifesto. Scrum is one of several frameworks that<a id="_idIndexMarker1698"/> instantiates Agile and makes the principles a reality through a group of practices. It is also, by far, the most popular Agile framework.</p>&#13;
			<p>It was created by Jeff Sutherland<a id="_idIndexMarker1699"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1700"/> and Ken <a id="_idIndexMarker1701"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1702"/>Shwaber in the 1990s and was inspired by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro<a id="_idIndexMarker1703"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1704"/> Nonaka when<a id="_idIndexMarker1705"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1706"/> they published <em class="italics">The New New Product Development Game</em>.<span id="footnote-058-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-058">14</a></span></p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<p>There have been numerous books written about Scrum and, as with any good framework, it has evolved and continuously improved with learning and experience. We would strongly recommend reading the latest <a id="_idIndexMarker1707"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1708"/>version of the Scrum Guide as presented by Sutherland and Schwaber at <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">https://scrumguides.org/</a>. It is an artifact we recommend re-reading every now and again to refresh your memory and knowledge of this very powerful framework. This is especially true when updates are made and there are new releases of the framework.</p>&#13;
			<p>We're not going to teach Scrum in this book as there are many better articles and books and, most importantly, the Scrum Guide can do that much better. What we are going to do is demonstrate how we have used Scrum in our engagements, how it fits into the Mobius Loop, and share some stories of good and bad Scrum adoptions.</p>&#13;
			<p>One of the reasons we love Scrum is because of its simplicity. Often people confuse the many (now hundreds) of practices associated with Agile as being Scrum. In fact, Scrum has very few practices. We tend to describe them as 3-5-3 (which sounds a bit like a formation for a sports team!).</p>&#13;

			<p>This Scrum picture can be<a id="_idIndexMarker1709"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1710"/> best described by grouping the roles, events, and artifacts.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-270"><a id="_idTextAnchor324"/>The 3-5-3 Formation</h3>&#13;
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker1711"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1712"/> 3-5-3 formation represents <a id="_idIndexMarker1713"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1714"/>3 roles, 5 events (previously known as ceremonies), and 3 artifacts. The three roles are the Product Owner, the <a id="_idIndexMarker1715"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1716"/>ScrumMaster, and the Development Team. The five <a id="_idIndexMarker1717"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1718"/>events are<a id="_idIndexMarker1719"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1720"/> Sprint Planning, the Daily Scrum (often known as the Daily Stand-Up), the <a id="_idIndexMarker1721"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1722"/>Sprint <a id="_idIndexMarker1723"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1724"/>Review (sometimes called the Showcase), the Sprint Retrospective, and <a id="_idIndexMarker1725"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1726"/>the Sprint itself as a fixed time-box container. The three artifacts are the Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Product Increment. That's it! That's all there is to Scrum. Those three roles, five events, and<a id="_idIndexMarker1727"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1728"/> three artifacts. All those other things you hear and read about, like Definitions of Ready and Definitions of Done, Burndown and Burnup, User Stories and Story Points, and so on are all great supporting practices, but not a part of the Scrum framework. Let's share a few recommendations and examples about each component of the Scrum framework, starting with the roles.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-271">T<a id="_idTextAnchor325"/><a id="_idTextAnchor326"/>he Product Owner Role</h3>&#13;
			<p>In <em class="italics">Chapter 11,</em> <em class="italics">The Options Pivot</em>, we introduced the idea of Product Ownership, and strongly recommended watching Henrik Kniberg's <em class="italics">Product Ownership in a Nutshell</em> video<span id="footnote-057-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-057">15</a></span>. If you haven't watched it yet, then please put this book down and go and watch it now. Even if you did watch it then, we'd suggest watching it again. It's 15 minutes of information that is pure gold.</p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<p>"<em class="italics">The Product Owner should have been a key contributor and supporter throughout the Discovery Loop and Options Pivot,</em>" explains Kniberg, their big focus being on enabling communication and <a id="_idIndexMarker1729"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1730"/>collaboration between Development Team members and stakeholders. They convey the message of envisioned products and set priorities for the team by utilizing many of the Options Pivot practices.</p>&#13;
			<p>In a Delivery Iteration, this communication is even more important. Having a Product Owner that can be the voice of the business, the voice of the user (even the voice of technology stakeholders), and be able to regularly converse with developers is a key ingredient in enabling high performance in Scrum teams. That means face-to-face interaction, negotiations, alignment, and driving shared understanding between the Development Team and the Product Owner.</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p>The Product Owner needs to be regularly available to the Development Team, especially during Product Backlog Refinement to, for example, write and agree on acceptance criteria, and during Scrum events, such <a id="_idIndexMarker1731"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1732"/>as Sprint Planning.</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure">F<a id="_idTextAnchor327"/><a id="_idTextAnchor328"/>igure 12.12: Development Team member clarifying his understanding with his Product Owner and Business experts</p>&#13;
			<p>In the case study story in <em class="italics">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italics">The Options Pivot</em>, <em class="italics">Experimenting with different Product Owners</em>, we <a id="_idIndexMarker1733"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1734"/>mentioned that Product Owners should see their current role as one to self-destruct and not be needed long-term. They can make themselves obsolete by successfully facilitating the Development Team members, directly connecting them with stakeholders and users, and building those relationships to a level so that their facilitative role is no longer needed.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-272">The<a id="_idTextAnchor329"/><a id="_idTextAnchor330"/> ScrumMaster Role</h3>&#13;
			<p>We have not included a<a id="_idIndexMarker1735"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1736"/> photo of a ScrumMaster in action because the ScrumMaster arguably should not ever be seen to be in too much frontline action. Their role is an enabling one. ScrumMasters should create an environment and a safe space that enables the Development Team to see all the action. Of course, this does not happen immediately, especially with a newly formed team or a team unfamiliar with Agile or Scrum. In these cases, they have to coach the team on the Scrum process and help move them towards a more productive environment.</p>&#13;
			<p>Through great facilitation, great preparation of practices, and effective coaching of practices, the ScrumMaster should promote autonomy in the team, self-correction and continuous improvement, and self-organization. It is another role where the person in it should be trying to remove the need for themself. The ultimate autonomous, self-organizing, self-correcting team should no longer need to be facilitated or led. </p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-273">The<a id="_idTextAnchor331"/><a id="_idTextAnchor332"/> Development Team Role</h3>&#13;
			<p>As we have already seen, the <a id="_idIndexMarker1737"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1738"/>Product Owner should aspire to remove the need for themselves because the Development Team is so well connected to users and stakeholders with strong psychological safety for two-way feedback and conversation between the two parties. The ScrumMaster should aspire to remove the need for themselves because they have facilitated an environment that is full of information radiation, very strong adoption of practices by a team that is fully autonomous, self-correcting, self-organizing, and continuously improving all the time. </p>&#13;
			<p>That just leaves one role in Scrum that doesn't remove the need for themselves, the Development Team. The term <em class="italics">Development Team</em> may be a little confusing. Firstly, as we've mentioned several times in this book already, DevOps is about bringing down the wall between Development and Operations, yet the Scrum terminology seems to still lean heavily towards Development. In reality, this team should include T-shaped people with breadth and depth and, between all its members, should be able to design, build, test, deploy, operate, and maintain features from the Product Backlog all the way to production.</p>&#13;
			<p>A great Development Team will most likely have been set up for success by a great ScrumMaster. Their workspace will be full of information radiators and artifacts generated by the Discovery Loop, Options Pivot, Delivery Loop, and foundational practices. Lots of care and attention will have gone into their surroundings, ensuring that the Development Team has been enabled and set up for the best possible success with as many foreseen and unforeseen obstacles removed. They will have organized time away from the computer, fed and watered the team, organized socials, and continuously monitored and improved the open culture and psychological safety of the team. The motivation levels, mood, and feeling of empowerment, autonomy, mastery, and purpose should be assessed and measured regularly (using practices such as the Social Contract, Stop-the-World events, Mood Marbles, and Real-Time Retrospective all introduced in <em class="italics">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italics">Open Culture</em>).</p>&#13;

			<p>Later in the book, in <em class="italics">Chapter 18</em>, <em class="italics">Sustain It</em>, we will look at larger multi-team organizations and some of the new patterns that help collaboration between the teams. But first, let's look at the artifacts that every team using Scrum should always have.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-274">The <a id="_idTextAnchor333"/><a id="_idTextAnchor334"/>Product Backlog Artifact</h3>&#13;
			<p>The term "backlog" is used frequently in <a id="_idIndexMarker1739"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1740"/>Agile. If the team is using Scrum, it's important to recognize that there are different types of backlogs and they serve very different purposes. The Product Backlog shows all the work and ideas of the whole product, prioritized according to value by the Product Owner and available for the stakeholders to see; for example, the most prioritized features to be built into the product next.</p>&#13;
			<p>In <em class="italics">Chapter 11, The Options Pivot</em>, we introduced the Product Backlog and showed how it emerged from Value Slicing and User Story mapping and was prioritized using practices such as Impact and Effort Prioritization, How-Now-Wow Prioritization, the Cost of Delay, and Weighted-Shortest-Job-First. From earlier chapters, we know that the Product Backlog items are all generated from practices and conversations on the Discovery Loop such as Impact Mapping, Event Storming, Human-Centered Design, Non-Functional Mapping, and Metrics-Based Process Mapping.</p>&#13;
			<p>The Product Backlog is such an important artifact that it should be displayed prominently, accessible to everyone, and should regularly be used by Product Owners, Development Team members, and ScrumMasters—as well as other stakeholders, and anyone else interested in the next steps of this product.</p>&#13;
			<p>The Product Backlog is <a id="_idIndexMarker1741"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1742"/>living and breathing and can be updated at any time. All the practices that lead to Product Backlog items also have artifacts that are living and breathing at any time. So, a stakeholder at any time might have a new impact or deliverable idea that can go straight onto the Impact Map. The Development Team may gather for a time-boxed Event Storming session <a id="_idIndexMarker1743"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1744"/>during their sprint to refine and answer some unanswered questions on the existing Event Storm, or they may start an Event Storm on a whole new area of the business. More user interviews, Human-Centered Design, and Empathy Mapping should continue. All of this will result in refined, improved, and new ideas that can be processed through Value Slicing, prioritized, and ending up on the Product Backlog.</p>&#13;

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-275">The S<a id="_idTextAnchor335"/><a id="_idTextAnchor336"/>print Backlog Artifact</h3>&#13;
			<p>The Sprint Backlog is <a id="_idIndexMarker1747"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1748"/>created during the Sprint Planning Event and shows all of the items the team has pulled from the Product Backlog into the Sprint Backlog (having assessed they are ready, according to their Definition of Ready). What results from a Sprint Planning session is a Sprint Backlog on a highly utilized and very important information radiator—the Sprint Board.</p>&#13;

			<p>The Sprint Board is one of the artifacts that sees the most use during a Delivery Loop iteration and one <a id="_idIndexMarker1749"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1750"/>of our favorite information radiators. In the preceding example, the following information is shown:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">The Sprint number.</li>&#13;
				<li>The Sprint Goal—a one- or two-sentence description of what the product should do in the next increment that it does not currently do. Ideally, this should link to the overall Target Outcomes agreed in the Discovery Loop.</li>&#13;
				<li>Key dates—the Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, and <a id="_idIndexMarker1751"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1752"/>Sprint Retrospective day, and the time required for this sprint.</li>&#13;
				<li>The Sprint Backlog items that have been pulled from the Product Backlog. There is a one-to-one matching and should be easily traceable from Product Backlog to Sprint Backlog.</li>&#13;
				<li>The Acceptance Criteria that have been agreed for each Sprint Backlog item.</li>&#13;
				<li>The low-level tasks that are needed to deliver the features according to agreed acceptance criteria. These are color-coded to radiate the cross-functional aspect of feature development, with different colors representing frontend and backend development, data, infrastructure, operations, and design.</li>&#13;
				<li>Columns to represent the flow of work on each task—Sprint Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Ready for Review, and Done.</li>&#13;
				<li>Avatars to show which pairs or mobs are working on a given task in the In Progress column.</li>&#13;

			<p>One of the most impressive<a id="_idIndexMarker1753"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1754"/> and powerful aspects of the Sprint Board is that it provides the (almost) final piece of traceability in the life of developing a given feature. If you walk-the-walls with all Discovery, Options, and Delivery artifacts available, you should be able to see a low-level task (typically a development activity performed by a pair of Development Team members that takes a few hours) and see its connection to:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">The overall feature/user story and the acceptance criteria <a id="_idIndexMarker1755"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1756"/>on the Sprint Backlog.</li>&#13;
				<li>Where that feature sits on the Product Backlog.</li>&#13;
				<li>How that feature was prioritized using Value Slicing and other prioritization tools.</li>&#13;
				<li>How that feature fits into the event-driven system and overall business process on the Event Storm.</li>&#13;
				<li>The measurable impact that was hypothesized with the feature on the Impact Map.</li>&#13;
				<li>The actors captured on the Impact Map the features can be user-tested with.</li>&#13;
				<li>The overall goal captured on the Impact Map and in Target Outcomes that this feature should be aiming to achieve.</li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>The final piece of traceability is the working software, which is the third increment of the Scrum framework.</p>&#13;

			<p>The seventh principle <a id="_idIndexMarker1757"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1758"/>of the Agile Manifesto states that working software is the primary<a id="_idIndexMarker1759"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1760"/> measure of progress. When the original writers of the Agile Manifesto met approximately ten years after the original manifesto was written, they ran a Retrospective event to see if their learning and experience would drive any updates to the values or principles. The <a id="_idIndexMarker1761"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1762"/>general consensus was that it still held true, and nothing needed to change other than, in some cases, underlining the importance of working software.</p>&#13;
			<p>Many Scrum teams fall down at this point and cannot show working software at the Sprint Review event. Even if they <a id="_idIndexMarker1763"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1764"/>do have partially built software to show at this event, that is not enough. There should ALWAYS be working software to show.</p>&#13;

			<p>One of the many techniques we use to create awareness and share ways of working between our staff at Red Hat Open Innovation Labs is to share short write-up summaries during a residency engagement.</p>&#13;
			<p>Often a similar summary is shared with customers with links to artifacts, photos of practices in action, and feedback captured or actioned.</p>&#13;
			<p>Mark O'Callaghan is an Open Innovation Labs Engagement Lead based in New York. In January 2018, he was leading an engagement <a id="_idIndexMarker1765"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1766"/>for UNICEF<span id="footnote-054-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-054">18</a></span> focused on data science with an emphasis on visualizing data from a couple of legacy applications to support UNICEF in Columbia.</p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<p>Mark would share weekly email updates of this engagement with a Red Hat community of Labs strategy and other interested parties. In his weekly summary, he would always include a link to the latest version of the application. This was working software running on OpenShift.</p>&#13;
			<p>This is an awesome example: it is always a good idea to have a Product Increment, a link to an app that people can click on — to look at, use, and provide feedback on.</p>&#13;

			<p>The final installation of our tour around the Scrum framework and how we use it is to explore five Scrum events – Sprint Planning, the Daily Scrum, the Sprint Review, the Sprint Retrospective, and the <a id="_idIndexMarker1767"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1768"/>Sprint itself.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-278"><a id="_idTextAnchor342"/><a id="_idTextAnchor343"/>The Sprint Planning Event</h3>&#13;
			<p>In the previous part <a id="_idIndexMarker1769"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1770"/>of this chapter, we showed the Sprint Board, an amazing information radiator that has a great amount of rich information about what the teams are currently doing and will be doing in this iteration of the Delivery Loop. The Sprint Planning Event is the event that generates this artifact. The Scrum Guide details how a Sprint Planning event should be run, who should attend, how long it should take, and so on. The following is how we tend to run it.</p>&#13;
			<p>First, we establish a goal. This should be a one- or two-sentence summary of what the focus of the sprint is. What will the product do in a week's time that it does not do now? What outcome might it achieve? This is often a great conversation to have with the Product Owner holding <a id="_idIndexMarker1771"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1772"/>the pen by the whiteboard ready to articulate his or her motivations in writing. But he or she always has tremendous support from the Development Team and a huge number of artifacts. It's useful to reflect on the Target Outcomes we established on the Discovery Loop, which should be nearby and visible. It's useful to look at the Product Backlog. If it has been well refined and prioritized, the items at the top should offer some clues as to what we might work on in this next iteration. Of course, it's useful to reflect and be reminded of all the wonderful information on other artifacts, Empathy Maps, and other user research, Impact Maps, Event Storms, Retrospective feedback, actions, and so on. Sometimes, we will draft the goal, then clarify and confirm it later on in the Sprint Planning event.</p>&#13;
			<p>Next, the team will start to pull items from the Product Backlog working from the top – the Product Owner or Project Manager does not do this. It's important to move away from a push phenomenon associated with traditional delivery models and for the team to be engaged in pulling the items needed to achieve the goal.</p>&#13;
			<p>When pulling items and adding them into the <a id="_idIndexMarker1773"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1774"/>Sprint Backlog, the team should confirm that the items are indeed ready to be worked on by consulting their Definition of Ready. If, like us, you work in short one-week sprints, it can be difficult to find enough time in the week to do enough refinement to have all Definition of Ready criteria satisfied before Sprint Planning. So we often will take some time to ensure items are ready, acceptance criteria are written and <a id="_idIndexMarker1775"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1776"/>understood, and the team is generally feeling comfortable and confident about the item in question.</p>&#13;
			<p>The third step is to decompose the items into low-level tasks. We capture all the things we need to do to deliver this feature to satisfy the acceptance criteria and to meet the Definition of Done (which we'll cover shortly). This is a great opportunity to follow another diverge-converge pattern or liberating structure as introduced in <em class="italics">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italics">Open Culture</em>, like 1-2-4-all. Getting everyone thinking about the work needed to deliver this increment and visualizing this is a really powerful aspect of this approach. This is detailed design on steroids! This is fixing bugs before we even write any code! As we saw in the example <a id="_idIndexMarker1777"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1778"/>Sprint Board, using different-color sticky notes to reflect different types of tasks such as frontend, backend, data, design, infrastructure, operations, and so on, visualizes the cross-functional nature of the team.</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 12.17: Product Owner Paul continues to iterate on his goal while a MakMakMakMak Development Team member pulls items from the Product Backlog into the Sprint Backlog</p>&#13;
			<p>After much collaboration, merging together of individual ideas for tasks into pairs, and then into pairs of pairs, and finally into a full group, we should have a Sprint Board, a complete visualization of the week ahead. The team should be fully aligned on the work that needs to be done. Now, can we achieve this? We finish the Sprint Planning event with a Confidence Vote – how confident are we? Can we meet the Sprint Goal by delivering the features in the Sprint Backlog? Can we <a id="_idIndexMarker1779"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1780"/>satisfy all the Acceptance Criteria agreed and complete all tasks by the date of the Sprint Review on the board? Team members vote with their fingers—0 or 1 means very low confidence and we need to re-scope or discuss what it will take to increase confidence. A group consensus of 4 or 5 is what we want, and this indicates confidence from the outset.</p>&#13;

			<p>As you can see from the photographs, those big 8-foot by 4-foot foam boards, which we explained in <em class="italics">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italics">Open Environment and Open Leadership</em>, are incredibly powerful as Sprint Boards. They are light and portable and can easily be transported to different areas of the build, for example, to the Daily Scrum or to a Daily Stand-Up event.</p>&#13;
			<p>Iteration or Sprint <a id="_idIndexMarker1781"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1782"/>Planning has its own entry in the Open Practice Library and is an excellent resource to find out more, contribute improvements, and discuss with the wider community the use of this practice.

			<p>This event is the most popular<a id="_idIndexMarker1783"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1784"/> Agile practice and is often how Agile teams start adopting Agile <a id="_idIndexMarker1785"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1786"/>practices. Just meeting for 15 minutes each day to synchronize activities can be so valuable in keeping the team connected and driving autonomy.</p>&#13;
			<p>We tend to find the team <strong class="bold">talking to the board</strong> works well. As each member summarizes what they worked on yesterday (to take the team towards its sprint goal), what they're planning to work on today (to take the team to its sprint goal), and any blockers or impediments (preventing the team from meeting its sprint goal), the board can be updated to ensure it is radiating the same information as what the team members are saying. Are the avatars of individuals showing the task they're working on? Have we agreed on what pairs or mobs are going to form for upcoming tasks? Are blockers clearly radiated in the Blocked column?</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure">Figure 12.19: Daily Scrum practice</p>&#13;
			<p>The Daily Scrum<a id="_idIndexMarker1787"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1788"/> is often an <a id="_idIndexMarker1789"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1790"/>event where <strong class="bold">Scrum-but </strong>antipatterns start to emerge. Scrum-but represents activities or behaviors that the Scrum team exhibit that do not conform to the Scrum framework. For example:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>We use Scrum but all of our management shows up to Daily Scrums to get status updates.</li>&#13;
				<li>We use Scrum but our Daily Scrums tend to run to between 30 and 60 minutes.</li>&#13;
				<li>We use Scrum but we vary the time of our Daily Scrums and who attends.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>These are all anti-patterns to an incredibly simple practice that is purely for the Development Team to synchronize with each other and highlight any blockers. Jeff Sutherland often <a id="_idIndexMarker1791"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1792"/>says if your Daily Scrum takes more than 15 minutes, you're doing it wrong.</p>&#13;

			<p>Let's fast-forward to the end of the Sprint and look at a very valuable practice, the Sprint Review Event or Showcase.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-280">The<a id="_idTextAnchor350"/><a id="_idTextAnchor351"/> Sprint Review Event</h3>&#13;
			<p>The<a id="_idTextAnchor352"/><a id="_idTextAnchor353"/> Scrum framework calls this <a id="_idIndexMarker1793"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1794"/>event the Sprint Review and provides an opportunity to show the new Product Increment and invites feedback. This Open Practice Library entry is called the Showcase.</p>&#13;
			<p>Some hints and tips we've picked up on the Showcase are as follows:</p>&#13;
			<p>First, invite the world! This is such a wonderful opportunity to showcase the product increment to valuable stakeholders and users. It's helpful to schedule this event at the same time and place as every iteration and also make it accessible to join remotely – investing in good video conferencing systems can really improve engagement.</p>&#13;
			<p>This is a great opportunity to reconnect with existing stakeholders and contributors to the Discovery Loop practices. Look at the actors on your Impact Map. Look at the people for whom we produced an Empathy Map. Can we get those folks back in to see the emerging product and provide further feedback?</p>&#13;
			<p>The Showcase should not just be a showcase of shiny new functional features, but of everything the team has worked on and wants to show off to the wider stakeholder community. Often our Showcases will include:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>CI/CD infrastructure (and perhaps a demonstration of delivering a small code feature and how<a id="_idIndexMarker1795"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1796"/> that triggers the CI/CD pipeline).</li>&#13;
				<li>An update on UI/UX including any new user research <a id="_idIndexMarker1797"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1798"/>or user testing performed, the evolution of prototypes, and the learning that has emerged.</li>&#13;
				<li>The latest iterations of the Big Picture and emerging architecture.</li>&#13;
				<li>Showing how the teams have worked and the practices they have used. This often includes what we call the Practice Corner—an information radiator made up of the Mobius Loop and Foundation, with all the practices that the team have been using.</li>&#13;
				<li>An updated Product Backlog with words <a id="_idIndexMarker1799"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1800"/>from the Product Owner about what to expect next.</li>&#13;
				<li>A review of the overall Target Outcomes and Enabling Outcomes and whether this latest Product Increment has shifted the needle on the measures.</li>&#13;
				<li>Running the Showcase in the same physical workspace as where the team normally works, opening the options for a walk-the-walls and inspection of all Discovery, Options, Delivery, and Foundation artifacts and information radiators.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;

			<p class="figure">Figure 12.20: Sprint Review/Showcase</p>&#13;
			<p>We will explore much more about the measurements and learnings, including those captured from Showcase events, in the next chapter. The Showcase should not just be limited to an event. We need to <a id="_idIndexMarker1801"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1802"/>seek other creative ways to show the world what we've delivered and how we've delivered it in this latest iteration of the Delivery Loop.</p>&#13;
			<p>As mentioned earlier, our Engagement Leads tend to do a short write-up to summarize progress and share the latest Product Increment and other artifacts. They send this via email to all stakeholders and anyone interested in the product and/or team. Visually, this can be enhanced by including a few photos of the event, or a short video montage of the team in action and the product evolving from the last sprint. Our engagement nearly always produces a series of weekly videos, which, when watched one after the other, produces an amazing story.</p>&#13;
			<p>As we explained with the Product Increment Artifact, having working software is the most important ingredient of the showcase. Being able to provide a link to the application and inviting the Showcase audience to touch and feel the user interface is very engaging. Having a laptop in the workspace that always has the latest increment of the working software product running is great for stakeholders visiting the workspace, walking the walls, tracing feature <a id="_idIndexMarker1803"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1804"/>history through all the practices, and seeing them for real in the product.</p>&#13;
			<p>Finally, Showcases are limited in value if we do not get feedback from them. Great ScrumMasters and Engagement Leads will be creative around ways to do this. Don't just limit this to an <em class="italics">any questions or feedback</em> session at the end. Allow online feedback in a Google document, or open a feedback channel on Slack or via SMS. Invite<a id="_idIndexMarker1805"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1806"/> value voting from stakeholders or use Net Promoter Score to capture fresh metric-based feedback on how likely stakeholders are to recommend the product and/or team.</p>&#13;

			<p>I was working with a team a few years ago to build a new shopping portal for a telecom company in Ireland. We used a Design Thinking framework to gather a list of features to develop a product based on Empathy Mapping, scenario maps, pain points, and opportunities captured. Getting information directly from users was gold, and we distilled all of our learning from them into three Target Outcomes for the initial release of the product. We built up a Product Backlog of features to build up our portal product.</p>&#13;
			<p>Then, after five weeks of Discovery, we adopted Scrum. Two-week sprints each delivered an increment of the product. Each Sprint included a Sprint Planning event, Daily Scrums, a Sprint Review, and a<a id="_idIndexMarker1807"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1808"/> Sprint Retrospective. </p>&#13;
			<p>If you look at the photograph, it is actually from the Sprint 2 Review! I chose this photo because seconds after I took it, the lady just out of the shot called out how we'd completely missed some key complexity in pricing administration. It was something we had not considered until this moment.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			<p>Figure 12.21: Sprint 2 Review</p>&#13;
			<p>This incident highlights the positives of early and regular feedback on an evolving product. When would this have been caught if we were not attempting Scrum?</p>&#13;
			<p>It also highlighted that such feedback triggers the need for some further discovery (for example, through Design Thinking).</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>This example frames<a id="_idIndexMarker1809"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1810"/> nicely where the learning and feedback from a Delivery Loop can trigger the need to return to the Discovery Loop. We'll be exploring this and other patterns when we return to the Options Pivot in <em class="italics">Chapter 18</em>, <em class="italics">Sustain It</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>To share experiences, learning, contribute improvements to this practice, or simply read more about it, take a look at <a href="https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/showcase/">https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/showcase/</a>. We'll also return to other ways to capture metric-based feedback in the next chapter. The Showcase is one of the main forums for collecting this. Another one is the Sprint Retrospective Event.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-282"><a id="_idTextAnchor355"/><a id="_idTextAnchor356"/>The Sprint Retrospective Event</h3>&#13;
			<p>This is by far the most <a id="_idIndexMarker1811"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1812"/>important practice in this book. If we don't do Retrospectives, we don't learn. If we don't learn, we don't improve. If we don't improve, what's the point of all of this?</p>&#13;
			<p>In <em class="italics">Chapter 4, Open Culture</em>, we <a id="_idIndexMarker1813"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1814"/>introduced Retrospectives as a feedback mechanism and, in particular, we introduced the Real-Time Retrospective practice as a great way to build an open culture into the team's foundation. Hopefully, the Real-Time Retrospective practice has worked well and continued to be used during the journey through the Discovery Loop, the Options Pivot, and the Delivery Loop. It offers an immediate place to add feedback in reaction to something happening in real time.</p>&#13;
			<p>Retrospectives are short events where the team can take a break from what they are doing, take some time out to inspect how they have been working, and reflect on what has been working well, what hasn't, and what can be adapted and improved.</p>&#13;
			<p>If you were involved in a long traditional Waterfall program, you may have done some kind of <strong class="bold">Lessons Learned</strong> exercise at the very end. This is where everyone sits down and captures all the things they might have done differently if they were to start over again now. It all gets written up and filed away in some shared drive. If we're lucky, some other team or project might benefit from this learning but, often, it never gets looked at again. Well, Retrospectives are just like this BUT they happen much more regularly and the team in question gets to benefit from the learning as they go along!</p>&#13;
			<p>Retrospectives can happen at any time. In fact, you may well want to schedule a Retrospective after a long Event Storming session or after a first Product Backlog prioritization meeting. It is a foundational concept in the Open Practice Library as it is a tool that can be used at any time. A Sprint Retrospective is an event we run at the end of the Sprint or Delivery <a id="_idIndexMarker1815"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1816"/>Loop. The Scrum framework states that it should happen immediately after the Sprint Review.</p>&#13;
			<p>There are hundreds of different formats, styles, and themes of Retrospectives. People are coming up with new, fun, creative, and energetic ways to run Retrospectives all the time. Check out the Retrospective page of the Open Practice Library<span id="footnote-053-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-053">19</a></span>, which has links to many of these. If you have a link to your own personal favorite or have run your own, you could submit a pull request and add it!</p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<p>We're going to share a few different ways we have run Retrospectives and differentiate between <em class="italics">Retrospectives of breadth</em> and <em class="italics">Retrospectives of depth</em>.</p>&#13;
			<p>A Retrospective of breadth essentially inspects the time period that the event is focused on and asks what worked well, what did not, and what could be done to be better next time so as to address the things that did not work so well.</p>&#13;
			<p>Our recommended approach to a Retrospective is to use a <em class="italics">diverge-converge</em> technique or liberating structure to ensure everyone has an opportunity to contribute their feedback. So, start by allowing a few minutes for everyone to silently write down their feedback on what worked well, what didn't, and corrective action that could be taken.</p>&#13;
			<p>Then we converge and merge everyone's ideas together on an information radiator. We cluster common themes and have short discussions to achieve alignment. Finally, we agree on a set of corrective actions to come out of the Retrospective, prioritize them, and agree on owners to take them forward.</p>&#13;
			<div id="footnote-053" class="_idFootnote" epub:type="footnote">&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p>The next Retrospective should always open by reviewing the previous Retrospective's actions. The following are a few alternative ways to ask those questions and provide headings on the Retrospective's information<a id="_idIndexMarker1817"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1818"/> radiator:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>What should we START in the next sprint that we're not currently doing? What should we STOP in the next sprint that we are currently doing? What should we CONTINUE doing? What should we do MORE OF? What should we do LESS OF?</li>&#13;
				<li>What should we ADD? What should we DROP? What should we KEEP? What should we IMPROVE?</li>&#13;
				<li>What made us GLAD in the last sprint? What made us MAD? What made us SAD?</li>&#13;
				<li>What did we LIKE in the last sprint? What did we LEARN? What did we LACK? What did we LONG FOR? This format is known as the <strong class="bold">4Ls</strong>.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Preparing a simple canvas for one of these approaches will allow the team to collect and organize their feedback and radiate the resulting learning and actions for all to see.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer401" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 12.22: Popular Retrospective formats</p>&#13;
			<p>A slightly more creative and fun approach that has become popular is to use analogies to reflect and inspect the previous sprint. Canvases can be prepared with a theme such as:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">The Sailboat</strong>: What is our island—the goal or target we are aiming for? What is the wind—the things that will take us there? What things represent the anchor dragging us back and slowing us? What are the rocks or the risks that we might be overlooking?</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">The Hot Air Balloon</strong>: The hot air represents the things that are helping us rise up. What represents the weights that might be dragging us down? What is the sun that we want to steer towards for a smooth ride? What is the bad weather that might give us a bumpy ride?</li>&#13;
				<li><strong class="bold">The Motor Racing Car</strong>: What is the engine moving us forward? What is the parachute slowing us down?</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>There are many other similar <a id="_idIndexMarker1819"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1820"/>formats: the <em class="italics">Three Little Pigs</em> Retrospective with the houses made of straw, sticks, and bricks; the Star Wars Retrospective with the light side and the dark side. We've even followed musically themed Retrospectives such as Elvis and ABBA, where song titles represent the different inspection aspects.</p>&#13;
			<p>Some of the common pitfalls of Retrospectives include focusing far too much on the negative and not enough on what has worked well. A good way to look at this is if something has been working really well, how might we <strong class="bold">turn up</strong> this behavior and do even more of it? Another common pitfall is failing to capture Retrospective items. It's very easy to whine for an hour about all the things that have annoyed us. But what tangible thing can we do to fix it or at least make it better?</p>&#13;
			<p>On the other hand, sometimes we come up with too many things we want to fix and too many ideas for improvement. Use a prioritization practice (such as those outlined in the previous chapter) and radiate the actions on its own backlog, for everyone to see and help with.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 12.23: Example Retrospective canvas and actions list</p>&#13;
			<p>Retrospectives should be fun and engaging. They should be something the team looks forward to and has everyone motivated to inject energy into. This is an opportunity for the team to continuously improve.</p>&#13;
			<p>To help keep them engaged, especially<a id="_idIndexMarker1821"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1822"/> for long-lived product teams, it really helps to mix up the format. Try new ideas out for Retrospectives. Rotate the facilitator around the team so they can share the ownership of this practice, figuring out what works well with Retrospectives and what we should do more of, and what doesn't. In other words, sometimes we should run Retrospectives on our Retrospectives!</p>&#13;
			<p>A final tip comes from years of experience running Retrospectives away from the normal place of work and what we infamously<a id="_idIndexMarker1823"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1824"/> call <strong class="bold">The Pub Retro</strong>.</p>&#13;

			<p>Back in 2007, I was experiencing a great Scrum team for the first time. I had dipped my toe into Agile in the previous couple of years, but it was <a id="_idIndexMarker1825"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1826"/>really a mismatch of practices with a lot of Scrum-buts! One suggestion from a team member (who had come from a high-performing software house and was very skilled in Scrum) was to take our Retrospectives off-site and run them down at a local pub. He felt that removing people from their day-to-day workspace enabled them to look back and reflect on how the previous sprint had gone.</p>&#13;
			<p>We also recognized that, in traditional projects, after many months of effort, the software would go live, and we would usually celebrate that with some kind of event. With Scrum, we should potentially ship our software at the end of every sprint and we should strive to go live with every sprint as we steer towards continuous delivery. Therefore, it's right to celebrate, and what better place to do that than down at the local pub?</p>&#13;
			<p>A final point to make is that people can be a little more honest in a relaxed pub atmosphere, and more creative with their ideas. I must say, over the years, some of the very best ideas for improvement have come out of pub Retrospectives!</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p>Figure 12.24: Pub Retrospective</p>&#13;
			<p>Of course, it's important to bring all the artifacts and learning captured back to the physical workspace and that the Retrospective actions are included in backlogs, so they are prioritized and actioned.</p>&#13;
			<p>Experiment with the location on Retrospectives. My teams have gone beyond pubs by doing things like ten-pin bowling, urban golf, and meeting at a nice café and having a <em class="italics">retro</em>-<em class="italics">breakfast</em> together!</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor358"/><a id="_idTextAnchor359"/>There is so much to share <a id="_idIndexMarker1827"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1828"/>about Retrospectives.

			<p>Now that we have been through the 3-5-3 of Scrum <a id="_idIndexMarker1829"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1830"/>and got some anecdotes and learnings from our use of it, let's see Scrum in action with the PetBattle team.</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-284" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor360"/>A Sprint in the Life of PetBattle: Getting Ready</h2>&#13;
			<p>The PetBattle team decided to work on a one-week sprint cadence. Aidan, Emma, and Jen had used Scrum previously, but always with two-week sprints; they saw this as an opportunity to tighten the feedback loop and deliver outcomes quicker.</p>&#13;
			<p>Reminding themselves of the Scrum values and framework, the team drew up who was in the Scrum team on one of the unused whiteboards. There would be a single Scrum team (for now). Valerie would, of course, be the Product Owner. The<a id="_idIndexMarker1831"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1832"/> cross-functional Development Team would be made up of four engineers (Ciaran, Aidan, Emma, and Jen), the UX Designer (Dave), and the Quality Assurance expert (Susan). Eoin would be the ScrumMaster.</p>&#13;
			<p>Valerie was very proud of her Product Backlog. She felt, through using all the Discovery Loop and Options Pivot practices, it was well understood by her stakeholders and had been well prioritized using the WSJF economic prioritization model.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer405" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/B16297_12_25.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>Figure 12.25: PetBattle Product Backlog</p>&#13;
			<p>The team had their Definition of Ready up on the wall and had been running short Product Backlog Refinement sessions to get the top ten items of the Product Backlog ready according to the Definition of Ready. This meant talking through the items with Valerie (who occasionally would bring in a stakeholder or two to support the conversation), writing acceptance criteria.</p>&#13;
			<p>The team used the Confidence Voting practice to assess whether they felt the item could be delivered within a few days of development. They would also talk through and update the emerging Logical Architecture diagram to ensure they had a collective understanding as to how the feature would be built. Dave had been doing lots of sketches and wireframes for the UI and would add these to the conversation at the appropriate point.</p>&#13;
			<p>The Sprint cadence was set. Sprint Planning would take place between 10:00 and 12:00 every Thursday morning. Daily Scrum meetings would be scheduled between 09:30 and 09:45 every morning. The Sprint Review showcase would take <a id="_idIndexMarker1833"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1834"/>place on Wednesday afternoons at 15:00, immediately followed by the Sprint Retrospective, which would be held off-site at 16:30.</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-285" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor361"/>A Sprint in the Life of PetBattle: Sprint 1 Planning</h2>&#13;
			<p>The first Sprint Planning meeting was excellently facilitated by Eoin, who had the agenda up on the wall and managed the time effectively. The team spent 15 minutes talking about the Sprint 1 Goal. Valerie wanted to see the PetBattle app up and running so that she could share a link to it with Mary and a few others who volunteered to be user testers. For her to do this, she reckoned a great place to start would be by being able to add her pet and starting a competition. If the app could do this in a week, she'd be happy. Jen was super keen to use all the green from go work they'd done when establishing the technical foundation and ensuring that all components were being built using CI/CD with automated deployment and tracking. The four engineers were really keen to take an Ops-first mindset approach and ensure, from the offset, that they had a good, automated recovery framework in place as well as configurable logging.</p>&#13;
			<p>Bringing all these thoughts together, the team agreed on the Sprint 1 Goal to build the walking skeleton of PetBattle, connecting f/e to API to database underpinned by CI/CD, and provide the foundation for operations.</p>&#13;
			<p>Next up on the agenda was to pull items from the Product Backlog, do a final check that they were ready, and place them in the <a id="_idIndexMarker1835"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1836"/>Sprint Backlog. Eoin suggested the team copy the sticky notes and leave the Product Backlog information radiator complete. He would mark the items on the Product Backlog as they were added to the Sprint 1 Backlog. Eoin also had the idea to show on the Sprint Backlog what outcome the item was linked to. This was easy to see by referring to the Value Slice board. Overall, this simply meant that we had a great information radiator showing how outcome-focused the team was.</p>&#13;
			<p>The team pulled the top ten items on the Product Backlog into the Sprint Backlog. They talked through and made some final edits to the acceptance criteria. Valerie was excited because this would deliver the entire top slice of value from her Value Slicing in just one week! Aidan and Ciaran started to get a bit nervous as the sprint backlog filled up. They were really pleased that the sprint balanced functional development versus non-functional and work focused on operations. The team also loved that they could do some educational workshops on CI/CD and put the long-awaited breakfast and lunch planning in place to help improve the culture. But there was some nervousness around the TLS security and ensuring the performance. This would need some technical spikes and research and, with just four working days until the first Showcase, Aidan and Ciaran were worried that they would not have the time to do everything.</p>&#13;
			<p>They still proceeded to the second part of the Sprint Planning event and decomposed all the items into tasks. They decided to color-code their tasks, which would all be written on square sticky notes. Pink stickies would represent application development. Blue stickies would represent UI/UX and frontend development. Light green tasks would be focused on data configuration. Purple stickies would be automation. Dark green stickies would be infrastructure and platform work. Yellow stickies would be testing. There were some other tasks that were focused on culture, team building, and other squishy/fluffy stuff! They decided to call these squishy tasks, and these would be on the orange stickies.</p>&#13;
			<p>The team divided into pairs and each pair focused on two features. Every 5 minutes, they rotated the story so every pair could think about tasks for every feature. All tasks were then added to the Sprint Board, duplicates were removed, and a discussion took place on each task, until the teams were confident they had all the low-level details to deliver regarding each item on the Sprint Backlog as per the agreed acceptance criteria.</p>&#13;
			<p>Finally, Eoin facilitated a confidence vote using the Fist of Five. After a count of three, everyone displayed with their fingers (one to five) how confident they were that they would achieve the Sprint Goal, by delivering the sprint backlog according to the acceptance criteria and tasks set out by next Wednesday at 15:00. The votes ranged from two to four with Ciaran, Aidan, Emma, and Jen all voting <a id="_idIndexMarker1837"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1838"/>with just two fingers. The nervousness around getting all ten features done was growing. After some discussion, Valerie suggested removing the security- and performance-related items and putting them back on the Product Backlog. A second confidence vote now had everyone voting either four or five and there were many more smiles around the team!</p>&#13;
			<p>The Sprint Board was ready, which included a Burndown chart to visualize the progress of the 26 tasks on the board.</p>&#13;

			<p>Now we've seen Sprint 1 Planning complete, let's see how the team got on with its delivery.</p>&#13;

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-286" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor362"/>A Sprint in the Life of PetBattle: Sprint 1 Delivery</h2>&#13;
			<p>Sprint 1 got underway. True to their social contract, the team worked as a mob when learning something for the first time and in pairs for all other tasks. They had their Daily Scrum every morning, not always at 09:30, and sometimes it ran over 15 minutes. This is something that would end up being discussed at the <a id="_idIndexMarker1839"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1840"/>Sprint Retrospective.</p>&#13;
			<p>Following constant nagging by Eoin, the team started to get better at updating the Sprint Board, with their avatars showing more clearly who was working on what. They also became more familiar with the Burndown chart, which showed how many tasks had been moved to Done at different points in time during the sprint. There was some confusion as to when the team could say a feature or task was done. Again, this would come up in the Sprint Retrospective.</p>&#13;
			<p>Before that, at 15:00 on Wednesday, the team had been working frantically to get their final tasks done; they were nearly done, but a few remained in progress. The CI/CD had been working well and there was a version of the app promoted to their testing environment during the<a id="_idIndexMarker1841"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1842"/> morning of their Sprint Review.</p>&#13;

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-287" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor363"/>A Sprint in the Life of PetBattle: Sprint 1 Review And Retrospective</h2>&#13;
			<p>A few stakeholders showed up to the Sprint Review, but not as many as Valerie had hoped for. They had to think about how best to share the updates. The Sprint Review had <a id="_idIndexMarker1843"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1844"/>a few glitches here and there but, on the whole, did not go badly for a first sprint. Valerie explained the goal she'd set for the team and Eoin ran through the Sprint Board. The team, one by one, showed the features they had been working on. Some were shown using the app's new frontend. Some were more technically involved and the demonstration consisted of walking through config files and running some tests. They even showed the breakfast and lunch rota and how they had set up a working relationship with Deliveroo! Dave shared a UX update and his plans to run some more user tests in the next sprint. Susan showed the automated testing framework up and running and even ran the automated tests during the demo.</p>&#13;
			<p>The showcase closed with Ciaran showing the updated big picture with the latest CI/CD infrastructure that this demo had been based on. Eoin brought out a new Information Radiator called <strong class="bold">The Practice Corner</strong>. This was a big Mobius Loop and Foundation that showed all the practices the team had used to date to build their Foundation, to get them round the Discovery Loop, through to the Options Pivot, and now completing the first Delivery Loop iteration. This really brought home how all the practices they had used fitted together. Stakeholders were invited to walk the walls to explore them in a bit more detail.</p>&#13;
			<p>The Development Team adjourned with Eoin to the local pub where they brought a load of sticky notes. They ran their Sprint 1 Retrospective, which was run using the simple <em class="italics">Start-Stop-Continue</em> format. The team collectively came up with a great summary of the sprint and they agreed that they should:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>CONTINUE pairing and mobbing</li>&#13;
				<li>STOP being late for Daily Scrums</li>&#13;
				<li>START holding free weights during Daily Scrum updates to stop updates from going on so long</li>&#13;
				<li>START a social playlist to have some music in the afternoon</li>&#13;
				<li>START using the Definition of Done practice (including writing the Definition of Done in Sprint 2)</li>&#13;
				<li>CONTINUE using and improving the CI/CD solution</li>&#13;
				<li>START having more information radiators such as build monitors and test scores</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The team raised their glasses and toasted SPRINT ONE DONE! The next morning, they'd start all over again with Sprint 2 planning.</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>These PetBattle stories provide an example of the full Scrum delivery cycle. As the team choose to do more delivery loops, the same processes are repeated.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-288"><a id="_idTextAnchor364"/><a id="_idTextAnchor365"/><a id="_idTextAnchor366"/>Using Scrum with distributed people</h3>&#13;
			<p>As with earlier practices<a id="_idIndexMarker1845"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1846"/> introduced in this book, the practices introduced in this chapter and on the Delivery Loop are highly collaborative and visual. A strong success factor is having Scrum teams co-located and being able to use physical artifacts like Product Backlogs and Sprint Backlogs.</p>&#13;
			<p>But many Scrum teams have succeeded with using Scrum with the people distributed, especially when they have invested in strong digital collaboration and video conferencing tools. The importance of culture and psychological safety introduced in <em class="italics">Chapter 4</em>,<em class="italics"> Open Culture</em>, is even more significant here and, crucially, the ability to learn and continuously improve. This is key to the success of Scrum teams, so investing the time to facilitate that environment of continuous learning can set up distributed Scrum teams for success.</p>&#13;
			<p>There are many tools that will emulate every practice and the way of working used physically in the room. We look to replicate every practice we would use in a room to work online and in real time. So, if a team used sticky notes and whiteboards to collaborate during Sprint Planning, they <a id="_idIndexMarker1847"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1848"/>need to be able to do that using a tool. If they use a big board for the Product Backlog, they need a tool to host that online. If they used Confidence Voting or planning poker for relative estimation, they need a tool to allow them to continue to do that. If they use a Burndown chart in the room, they need to find a way to keep doing that online.</p>&#13;
			<p>To help you get started, we have provided a simple Sprint Board that can be used to build Sprint Backlogs<a id="_idIndexMarker1849"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1850"/> during Sprint Planning, plan for feature demos during Sprint Reviews, and radiate the learnings <a id="_idIndexMarker1851"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1852"/>during Sprint Retrospectives.

			<p>To complete this section about Scrum, we're going to drop a bit of a bombshell. Scrum is sub-optimal. Scrum does not comply with Continuous Delivery. Scrum can actually create bottlenecks in delivery rather than removing them!</p>&#13;
			<p>You might now be wondering why we have spent so much time and pages explaining Scrum, sharing stories and learnings from using Scrum, and having our PetBattle team adopt Scrum. Well, Scrum provides a much-needed cadence and set of guardrails to start working in a more agile manner. Often, new or immature teams need these guardrails and frameworks to stay on the right path and ensure value is being delivered. But, as teams mature and get better, there may be a time when we can remove some or all of those guardrails.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-289">W<a id="_idTextAnchor367"/><a id="_idTextAnchor368"/>hen should we stop Scrumming?</h3>&#13;
			<p>Many teams love Scrum, as do stakeholders. The rhythm of being able to see outcomes delivered earlier more frequently is very satisfying and it corrects many of the problems experienced with the traditional Waterfall development of complex systems.</p>&#13;
			<p>In <em class="italics">Chapter 11,</em> <em class="italics">The Options Pivot</em>, we talked about how the Product Owner should aspire to remove the need for themselves because the Development Team is so well connected to users and stakeholders, with strong psychological safety for two-way feedback and conversation. Earlier in this chapter, we talked about how the ScrumMaster should aspire to remove the need for themselves because they have facilitated an environment that is full of information radiation and very strong adoption of practices by a team that is fully autonomous, self-correcting, self-organizing, and continuously improving. The Product Owner and ScrumMaster have two very strong guardrails that facilitate the Scrum framework. They <a id="_idIndexMarker1853"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1854"/>may never come down, but we should aspire.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's look at some other examples of guardrails that we might wish to remove.</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-290" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor369"/>Teams asking questions that suggest we've matured out of Scrum</h2>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer409" class="IMG---Figure" style="float: right; margin: 6px; hight:6cm; width:6cm;">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/Noel.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>Having worked with long-lived Scrum teams for several months, it's incredibly pleasing to see them continuously improve and become more autonomous with time. A pattern I've noticed with high-performing teams is that, after a while, they start to ask some very good questions about the processes and practices they are using. Some examples of questions I've had from ScrumMasters, Product Owners, and Development Team members include:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>Why are we waiting X days to demo/release? Scrum has the Sprint Review event <a id="_idIndexMarker1855"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1856"/>scheduled on the last day of every sprint. But sometimes a team will complete a feature and be ready to demo it and release it on the first day of the sprint!</li>&#13;
				<li>Why don't we continuously run Retrospectives? The Real-Time Retrospective is an awesome practice at capturing retrospective feedback and actions in more of a real-time manner rather than waiting until the end of the sprint. If this is being used effectively by the team, maybe there is less of a need to wait until the end of the sprint to agree on improvement actions.</li>&#13;
				<li>Why are we doing these 15-minute daily standups when we already know what everyone is doing? This holds particularly true when the team is <a id="_idIndexMarker1857"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1858"/>using mob programming more and more. The team members are so connected with each other and collaborate so closely that there is less of a need to formally synchronize every day.&#13;
				</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>A Product Owner I worked with at a European automotive company had a big <em class="italics">A</em>-<em class="italics">ha</em> moment in his fifth sprint when he asked, "<em class="italics">Why am I waiting till the end of the sprint to see feature X</em>?" He wanted to steer the team into a mindset whereby, "<em class="italics">When you've done a feature</em>, <em class="italics">show it to me and</em>, <em class="italics">if I'm happy with it</em>, <em class="italics">let's just ship it then and there.</em>" </p>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor370"/><a id="_idTextAnchor371"/>The examples above show how <a id="_idIndexMarker1859"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1860"/>Scrum might actually inhibit continuous delivery. They can, of course, release more frequently than just once in the sprint. The Scrum framework does not say that you can or should only release once.</p>&#13;
			<p>Teams may also feel, when they reach these points of realization and maturity, that they would be able to deliver more continuously if they moved to a different approach, to deliver and adopt Kanban.<a id="_idTextAnchor372"/></p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-291"><a id="_idTextAnchor373"/><a id="_idTextAnchor374"/>Kanban</h3>&#13;
			<p>Kanban is Japanese for <em class="italics">signboard</em>. Kanban<a id="_idIndexMarker1861"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1862"/> has its roots as a scheduling system used in <em class="italics">lean</em> manufacturing in the car industry and, in particular, Toyota cars.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the context of Agile, Kanban is another methodology. It specifically strives to better coordinate and balance work amongst team members. Most famously, it employs a <em class="italics">Kanban</em> to help visualize the process. The board is split into categories of <em class="italics">work to be done</em>, <em class="italics">work in progress</em>, and <em class="italics">completed work</em>. Each task is written onto a card that moves from column to column as it progresses through the team's process. Tasks are prioritized. The board keeps everyone on the same page and is highly visible, so it allows corrections to be made easily.</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-292" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor375"/>Kanban Board!</h2>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer410" class="IMG---Figure" style="float: right; margin: 6px; hight:6cm; width:6cm;">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>When running our <a id="_idIndexMarker1863"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1864"/>DevOps Culture and Practice Enablement workshop with members of our Open Innovation Labs team in 2018, we had the pleasure of meeting our colleagues in Japan. A lot of the lean culture and processes we describe in this book originate from Japan, so we always learn a lot from collaborating with our peers there.</p>&#13;
			<p>During the course, we referred to the Kanban board many times, which seemed to generate some laughter! Our Japanese colleagues eventually told us not to say, <strong class="bold">Kanban board </strong>as we were really saying <strong class="bold">signboard board</strong>. That's why we now refer to the artifact as the Kanban.</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>Kanban requires strict <a id="_idIndexMarker1865"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1866"/>limits on the number of tasks in progress at any given time. This is called the <em class="italics">Work In Progress,</em> or WIP limit. No new work can enter the column once the WIP limit is reached. Teams need to work collaboratively to fix issues, identify bottlenecks, and get tasks Done. This collaborative work style leads to continual improvement of the team's processes. The team can meet periodically to discuss changes that are needed, and these are displayed on the Kanban.</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 12.29: Example Kanban</p>&#13;
			<p>Scrum and Kanban are <a id="_idIndexMarker1867"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1868"/>not mutually exclusive. In fact, in our PetBattle example, we walked through the team using Scrum but, in the Sprint Board, they were using Kanban to visualize and track work.</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;

			<p>Implementing and delivering the<a id="_idIndexMarker1869"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1870"/> PetBattle Tournament feature needed to be done quickly. The existing hobbyist application was developed in a very ad hoc manner, so there<a id="_idIndexMarker1871"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1872"/> is little current process. Adopting Agile Scrum or Kanban looked like a great <a id="_idIndexMarker1873"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1874"/>place to start for the cross-functional team.</p>&#13;
			<p>Can the team decide when the <em class="italics">PetBattle Tournament Feature</em> gets deployed to production? YES! Can the team decide how to build, test, and deploy the <em class="italics">PetBattle Tournament Feature</em>? YES! By allowing the team to be autonomous, decision-making happens wherever the information is within the team. This trust and delegation of the PetBattle app delivery by the founders to the team is crucial to the product's future success.</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>Kanban has its own page<a id="_idIndexMarker1875"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1876"/> in the Open Practice Library, which can be used for more information, discussion, and improvement, at <a href="https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/kanban/">https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/kanban/</a>.</p>&#13;
			<p>An important practice that we have not yet introduced and that applies to teams using both Scrum and Kanban is the Definition of Done.</p>&#13;
			&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-294"><a id="_idTextAnchor377"/><a id="_idTextAnchor378"/>The Definition of Done</h2>&#13;
			<p>What does Done mean in the <a id="_idIndexMarker1877"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1878"/>context of writing software features? Does it mean your code builds and runs on your computer? Does it mean testing has been performed? Does it mean the code has been checked in? What about documentation? What about operational readiness? These are all good questions, and the chances are that if you ask these questions to different people, you will get very different answers.</p>&#13;
			<p>When we use a Kanban and/or a Sprint Board in Scrum, there is a column on the right with the title DONE. So, what does Done mean here? This is why we use a Definition of Done practice. The Definition of Done is a criterion agreed across the team and shared with others that should be met before any work items are considered complete by any team member. It is <em class="italics">collaboratively created, maintained, and enforced by the team</em> where non-functional and functional work that should be performed for each and every work item can be managed.</p>&#13;
			<p>Earlier in this chapter, we talked about how we write Acceptance Criteria against features or stories on the Product Backlog. This is a specific criterion that applies to the context of the feature in question and only that feature. The Definition of Done criteria is additional criteria that also needs to be considered in the planning and delivery of every feature.</p>&#13;
			<p>So, if we say that we are always going to check code into a source-code control system to trigger a CI build and a feature should not be considered done unless this has been done, we can add this to the Definition of Done. If a team agrees that we should always have a percentage of the code covered by automated tests and we should never fall below that given <a id="_idIndexMarker1879"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1880"/>percentage, we can write Definition of Done criteria to manage this.</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-295" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor379"/><a id="_idTextAnchor380"/>PetBattle – Definition of Done</h2>&#13;
			<p>In Sprint 1, the PetBattle team had a Definition of Ready in place and it worked effectively in ensuring that items they accepted into the Sprint were well understood and the team had confidence they would complete them in the sprint.</p>&#13;
			<p>However, they did not write a Definition of Done. This led to some challenges during the sprint as there was ambiguity as to what should happen before a feature is considered Done. It came up in the Sprint Retrospective discussion and the team agreed to run a Definition of Done workshop during Sprint 2.</p>&#13;
			<p>Eoin facilitated this and asked the question of what should always be done when working on a Sprint Backlog item, regardless of what it is. The team came back with several suggestions:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>The code and any other artifacts must always have been committed to a feature branch in Git.</li>&#13;
				<li>The feature branch should have been merged into the master.</li>&#13;
				<li>The CI build should always have run with all tests passing.</li>&#13;
				<li>We will have checked the documentation folder and made any updates to product documents to support the work being done.</li>&#13;
				<li>The Product Owner should have seen the feature working and the acceptance criteria satisfied.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>This provided a great starting point and, in particular, Aidan and Emma recognized that the Definition of Done was a great tool for ensuring the non-functional aspects that they had brainstormed using the Non-Functional Wheel could be considered for each and every item.</p>&#13;
<p>Some of those items had ended up on the Value Slicing board because there was specific work involved in configuring them. But many of them needed team behaviors or some automation to be focused on continuously addressing the <strong class="bold">non-functional requirements</strong> (<strong class="bold">NFRs</strong>).</p>&#13;
<p>The team revisited all of the items on the Non-Functional Wheel and categorized each item into one of three lists:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Requires platform setup/config/spike</li>&#13;
				<li>Comes for free with platform</li>&#13;
				<li>Team behavior/principle</li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<div id="_idContainer412" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="../Images/B16297_12_30.jpg" alt=""/></div>&#13;
				<p>Figure 12.30: Transferring non-functional requirements to Definition of Done criteria</p>&#13;
				<p>Items in the first column were seen as features to be included on the Product Backlog, as they needed specific work to be done to enable them in a sprint. Items in the third column were all items that should be considered as a part of the Definition of Done. However, given they were so low-level and detailed, the team decided to add a few more items to their Definition of Done that would mean they were duly considered:</p>&#13;
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>There must be at least one automated integration test covering acceptance criteria.</li>&#13;
				<li>Checks will be run (automated where possible) to ensure that all non-functional principles remain upheld.</li>&#13;
				<li>The feature is running on the demonstration laptop and ready for the stakeholders to see demonstrated at any time.</li>&#13;
				</ul>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			<p>The Definition of <a id="_idIndexMarker1881"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1882"/>Done provides a place for non-functional requirements and quality to be managed effectively. While it starts as a big visual information radiator, it drives more and more quality into the product. It also provides many opportunities for automation. Given the Definition of Done criteria is something that will be tested for each and every backlog item accepted into a sprint, the same tests to meet the criteria should be run over and over again. So, automation is certainly our friend here. To explore the Definition of Done practice further, visit the Open Practice Library page at <a href="https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/definition-of-done/">https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/definition-of-done/</a>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now that we have introduced the<a id="_idIndexMarker1883"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1884"/> Definition of Done, when we plan sprints or the tasks to deliver a specific feature, we can improve the questions that teams should ask about each backlog item. What tasks are needed to deliver this feature to satisfy the agreed acceptance criteria and comply with the Definition of Done? And, as Retrospectives continue to inspect how to improve, the team should consider what they can add to their Definition of Done to improve the overall product and what to automate to make Done a part of CI/CD.</p>&#13;
			<p>When a team does not have a Definition of Done visible or they are failing to follow it or build it into their CI/CD pipeline, it is a Bad Agile Smell that tends to result in the rise of technical debt and the <a id="_idIndexMarker1885"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1886"/>slowdown of team velocity. Let's look at a few other Bad Agile Smells we've seen.</p>&#13;
			<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; display:block; overflow-x:auto; padding:.5em;margin: 5px;">&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-296"><a id="_idTextAnchor381"/>Bad Agile Smells</h2>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>Over the years, we have spotted several anti-patterns in Agile teams and things we look out for and test early in our engagements with customers. Here are our top ten:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">There is no Product Owner or there is a Product Owner who lacks the three important attributes—empowered, available to the team, and understands the business.</li>&#13;
				<li>No working software: Either CI/CD is not working sufficiently (or not in place at all) or automated testing is not sufficient. There should always be a working version of the product that can be demonstrated or released at any time. It may not do very much, and the business may want more features before the release, but this has to always be a business decision rather than a technical constraint.</li>&#13;
				<li>Sprints are pre-planned in advance. With variable scope, we need to let the teams control what they load into their sprints. Over time, they will establish metrics on their velocity and predictability—both should get better and there are powerful tools to help them size and forecast accurately.</li>&#13;
				<li>Retrospectives don't happen or don't result in actions. Continuous improvement should be a part of the DNA of everyone involved in this system of work. The Retrospective is the fundamental building block to enable this.</li>&#13;
				<li>Stand-ups take over 30 minutes and lots of meetings. For Agile delivery to be effective, we have to allow the teams to get on with the work and figure out the solutions themselves. Overloading them with meetings will only slow them down. Let's keep the meetings to the basic events of Scrum and Product Backlog Refinement.</li>&#13;
				<li>Water-Scrum-Fall: Upfront planning and design, delivery of features in iterations, but only to pre-production because a tail-end operational readiness phase is needed. This removes all the benefits of Agile and does not provide continuous delivery. Think about using the Mobius Loop to articulate how quickly and frequently we're really traveling round these loops.</li>&#13;
				<li>Teams are not cross-functional. This results in dependencies, blockers, and an inability to deliver continuously.</li>&#13;
				<li>Lack of empowerment in teams to say no to items that are not ready. Using tools like the Definition of Ready and empowering teams to be autonomous drives up the culture, motivation, and ability to deliver continuously.</li>&#13;
				<li>Imbalance of functional versus non-functional features work pulled into sprints. We need to continuously balance the needs and feedback from the team (for example, Retrospectives), including the need to continuously improve architecture and CI/CD and keep the team filled with autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Otherwise, technical debt rises, motivation declines, and continuous delivery slows or stops.</li>&#13;
				<li>Push not pull. The systems we put in place are to empower teams to pull work rather than have it planned for them and pushed upon them.</li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>These Bad Agile Smells should be kept in mind and, if they start to appear, we recommend using the Retrospective event as a starting point to discuss and course-correct.</p>&#13;

			<p>In this chapter, we progressed from the Discovery Loop and Options Pivot and focused on how we deliver features into products using practices on the Delivery Loop. We explored different domains of delivery using the Cynefin framework and saw how Waterfall remains effective for work in the <em class="italics">clear</em> domain, whereas Agile is more suitable for work in the <em class="italics">complex</em> and <em class="italics">complicated</em> domains.</p>&#13;
			<p>We explored where Agile came from, the Agile Manifesto, and took a detailed look into Scrum and Kanban methods, the practices they use, as well as supporting practices such as the Definition of Ready and the Definition of Done.</p>&#13;

			<p>We can now see how Agile frameworks and practices help achieve continuous delivery when using platforms such as OpenShift and, when coupled with high-performing teams and an autonomous culture, we can deliver outcomes that matter earlier and much more frequently.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the next chapter, we're going to dive deeper into the Measure and Learn part of the Delivery Loop and look at different mechanisms and tools that facilitate measurement and learning.</p>&#13;
