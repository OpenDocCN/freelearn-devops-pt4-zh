		</div>
		<div id="_idContainer447" class="Content">
			<p>In previous sections, we've been discussing the approach we're taking in discovering and prioritizing work to deliver applications such as PetBattle. This includes the many aspects we need to consider when building the solution's components. Now it's time to actually deliver working software:</p>

			<p class="figure">Figure 14.0.1: Focusing on the How</p>
			<p>This section is where we do the following:</p>
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
				<li>Build the solution components (the API, frontend, and so on) using our preferred automation stack.</li>
				<li>Deploy these components onto the OpenShift Container Platform in a repeatable way.</li>
				<li>Own and manage them so that we can watch the site grow and thrive in a culture that empowers our community of motivated developers.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once our master cat plan is complete, we will become filthy rich in the process! As PetBattle investors, we can then buy islands, invest in space engineering, or just sip martinis by the pool all day until it becomes so boring that we start a new cryptocurrency named <em class="italics">Pet-Coin</em> and lose it all.</p>
			<p>To set expectations correctly, we're not really going into detail about all of the application code itself. All the source code is available (in the Git repositories for the book) and you can go through it at your own pace. There is a lot of value going through the code, in particular the Helm, Quarkus, and AI code.</p>
			<p>Our focus is on how to use the tooling provided within OpenShift to build, deploy, and run the applications. We will go into certain advanced features, such as Operators, Serverless, Service Mesh, and CI/CD tooling examples and techniques. Our intention is to provide examples and advice around why we choose to use certain tools or techniques and approaches and how all of them fit together in a cohesive approach specific to PetBattle. You can then pick and choose which ones you want to use in your own projects. </p>
			<p>The section is broken down into three parts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em class="italics">Chapter 14</em>, <em class="italics">Build It</em>: This is where we introduce how we will use Git as the single source of truth. We will cover taking our source code and packaging it using either Tekton or Jenkins.</li>
				<li><em class="italics">Chapter 15</em>, <em class="italics">Run It</em>: This section covers testing, introducing a new <a id="_idIndexMarker2080"/><a id="_idIndexMarker2081"/>component to our app with Knative, running A/B tests, and capturing user metrics using some of the advanced deployment capabilities within OpenShift.</li>
				<li><em class="italics">Chapter 16</em>, <em class="italics">Own It</em>: This section covers keeping the lights on with monitoring and alerting feedback loops. We will also touch upon the importance of Operators in Kubernetes.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Throughout these chapters, we cover a core belief that all teams should want to take pride in their code. A team member should want to Build It, Run It, and ultimately OwnÂ It.</p>

			<p>If you feel like the low-level technical details are a bit too much for you or not something you're super interested in, that's OK! The next three chapters may seem like a change in gear, but we'd recommend against skipping over the chapters completely. </p>
			<p>Don't worry too much about the low-level details, code snippets, and screenshots, it's important for everyone to grasp the value of the concepts in this book. That includes the value of any technical improvements the team wants to make. The following chapters should help articulate that.</p>
