    As PetBattle investors, we can then buy islands, invest in space engineering,
    or just sip martinis by the pool all day until it becomes so boring that we start
    a new cryptocurrency named *Pet-Coin* and lose it all.

- en: To set expectations correctly, we're not really going into detail about all
    of the application code itself. All the source code is available (in the Git repositories
    for the book) and you can go through it at your own pace. There is a lot of value
    going through the code, in particular the Helm, Quarkus, and AI code.

- en: Our focus is on how to use the tooling provided within OpenShift to build, deploy,
    and run the applications. We will go into certain advanced features, such as Operators,
    Serverless, Service Mesh, and CI/CD tooling examples and techniques. Our intention
    is to provide examples and advice around why we choose to use certain tools or
    techniques and approaches and how all of them fit together in a cohesive approach
    specific to PetBattle. You can then pick and choose which ones you want to use
    in your own projects.

    the single source of truth. We will cover taking our source code and packaging
    it using either Tekton or Jenkins.'

    of the advanced deployment capabilities within OpenShift.'

    to take pride in their code. A team member should want to Build It, Run It, and
    ultimately OwnÂ It.

    or not something you're super interested in, that's OK! The next three chapters
    may seem like a change in gear, but we'd recommend against skipping over the chapters
    completely.

    it's important for everyone to grasp the value of the concepts in this book. That
    includes the value of any technical improvements the team wants to make. The following
    chapters should help articulate that.
