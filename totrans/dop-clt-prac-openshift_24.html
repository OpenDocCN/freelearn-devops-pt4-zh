			<p>This book has been a journey. We established the foundation in <em class="italics">Section 2, Establishing the Foundation</em>, to support our Application Product team. We moved that team onto the Discovery Loop portion of the Mobius Loop in <em class="italics">Section 3, Discover It</em>. They then progressed into the Options Pivot in <em class="italics">Section 4, Prioritize It</em>, before moving onto their first iteration of the Delivery Loop in <em class="italics">Section 5, Deliver It</em>.</p>
			<p>We then dove deep into building applications with the PetBattle product team in <em class="italics">Section 6, Build It, Run It, Own It</em>.</p>
			<p>In the last segment of the Mobius Loop journey, we return to the Options Pivot and ask ourselves what we learned from the Delivery Loop.</p>

			<p>What should we do next? Should we go around the Delivery Loop again or should we return to the Discovery Loop? What about revisiting our options? These will be the questions we answer in <em class="italics">Chapter 17, Improve It</em>.</p>

			<p>In <em class="italics">Chapter 18, Sustain It</em>, we will revisit the entire journey we've been on and explore what it takes to sustain this way of working, including how to sustain the people, processes, and technology improvements we have been making throughout this book. We can then start to scale and spread these ways of working to other teams throughout the organization.</p>
