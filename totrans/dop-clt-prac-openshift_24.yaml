- en: This book has been a journey. We established the foundation in *Section 2, Establishing
    the Foundation*, to support our Application Product team. We moved that team onto
    the Discovery Loop portion of the Mobius Loop in *Section 3, Discover It*. They
    then progressed into the Options Pivot in *Section 4, Prioritize It*, before moving
    onto their first iteration of the Delivery Loop in *Section 5, Deliver It*.

    in *Section 6, Build It, Run It, Own It*.

    and ask ourselves what we learned from the Delivery Loop.

    we return to the Discovery Loop? What about revisiting our options? These will
    be the questions we answer in *Chapter 17, Improve It*.

- en: In *Chapter 18, Sustain It*, we will revisit the entire journey we've been on
    and explore what it takes to sustain this way of working, including how to sustain
    the people, processes, and technology improvements we have been making throughout
    this book. We can then start to scale and spread these ways of working to other
    teams throughout the organization.
