			<p>In the previous chapter, we transitioned from a single trip around the Mobius Loop, covered from <em class="italics">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italics">Discovering the Why and Who</em>, through <em class="italics">Chapter 13</em>, <em class="italics">Measure and Learn</em>, into an ongoing, never-ending, continuous journey of learning and improvement informed by metric-based outcomes.</p>&#13;
			<p>This book has focused on how a team can travel round the Mobius Loop from Discovery through Options and Delivery and back to Discovery again. The Open Practice Library has helped instantiate Mobius into a true outcome-based delivery built on a foundation of open culture <a id="_idIndexMarker3265"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3266"/>and open technology.</p>&#13;
			<p>The PetBattle case study was all about one team achieving one dream to be a high-performing, cross-functional, long-lived unit, delivering an awesome product and getting the very best out of the underlying technology, including OpenShift. Through the use of people, processes, and technology, they are a seed of inspiration and a trigger of infectious enthusiasm.</p>&#13;
			<p>Mobius is more than just a map for a team to follow; it is the navigator for the whole system of working.</p>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, we are going to ask, <em class="italics">how can we use Mobius and </em><em class="italics"><a id="_idIndexMarker3267"/></em><em class="italics">open practices to drive this </em><em class="italics"><a id="_idIndexMarker3268"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3269"/></em><em class="italics">mindset of continuous discovery, continuous delivery, and Options Pivoting on a foundation of culture and technology throughout a much larger organization</em>? In other words, how can we get 50 teams working together like the PetBattle team? We will explore how we can enable more Application Product Teams to work the same way, what it means for the platform, and what it means for the leadership and organizational strategy.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's start by visualizing the journey undertaken so far.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-457"><a id="_idTextAnchor734"/><a id="_idTextAnchor735"/>The Journey So Far</h2>&#13;
			<p>Let's use another open source artifact <a id="_idIndexMarker3270"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3271"/>available in the Mobius Kit<span id="footnote-189-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-189">1</a></span> called the Mobius Navigator. It provides a macro <a id="_idIndexMarker3272"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3273"/>perspective and underlying philosophy behind Mobius that can be applied to any complex system. The Mobius Navigator is a mental model that can be applied to almost anything, at all levels of an organization.</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p>We typically start on the left loop, although we don't have to. Sometimes legacy systems and organizations will start amidst delivery on the right loop and will seek to pivot over to the left as soon as is feasible. This happens because there are important, powerful questions that need to be asked about Discovery, and the sooner the organizations can get back to asking those questions, the better.</p>&#13;
			<p>As we work our way around the Mobius Navigator from the left, we ask the powerful <em class="italics">Why </em>questions. Why are we doing this? Who are we doing this for, and why will it help them? We discover what's really going on to come up with outcomes. We then generate ideas, refine and map out how to deliver options, and decide which options we're going to work on next. We deliver by designing, creating, and launching, measuring the impact as we learn by reflecting and improving. Finally, we adapt by discovering more, delivering more, or pivoting completely. </p>&#13;
			<p>The Mobius Loop allows <a id="_idIndexMarker3274"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3275"/>us to take the Mobius Navigator mindset and drill down into, for example, a product team and how they use Discover Maps, Options Maps, and Deliver Maps to continuously evolve products, delivering outcomes that matter with continuous measurements and learning built in. We saw this in action in PetBattle and with the many stories dotted throughout this book.</p>&#13;
			<p>We used a Discover Map at the end of <em class="italics">Chapter 10</em>, <em class="italics">Setting Outcomes</em>, to summarize <em class="italics">Section 3</em>, <em class="italics">Discover It</em>, and capture all the learning harnessed during the Discovery Loop. We used an Options Map at the end of <em class="italics">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italics">The Options Pivot</em>, to summarize <em class="italics">Section 4</em>, <em class="italics">Prioritize It</em>, and capture all the learning and decisions made during the Options Pivot. We used a Delivery Map at the end of <em class="italics">Chapter 13</em>, <em class="italics">Measure and Learn</em>, to summarize <em class="italics">Section 5</em>, <em class="italics">Deliver It</em>, and capture all the delivered impacts and learnings made during the Delivery Loop. If we connect these maps together, we see how the Mobius Loop is used to connect these three sections together and summarize the learning of product evolution.</p>&#13;
			<p>There is a lot of detail in <em class="italics">Figure 18.2</em>, and you can examine individual maps either at the end of the chapters outlined above or access PDF versions in this book's GitHub repository.</p>&#13;

			<p>Now, what if we had 10 different product teams in an organization working this way, each with their own set of maps for a product or product area they were responsible for?</p>&#13;
			<p>This idea becomes plausible through infectious enthusiasm, increased platform adoption, and an enhanced product mindset at different levels throughout the organization.</p>&#13;
			<p>A side note, but the majority of this book was <a id="_idIndexMarker3276"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3277"/>written during the COVID-19 pandemic when <strong class="bold">infection</strong> and <strong class="bold">spreading</strong> were very negative phenomena. It's nice to be writing about a much more positive impact of something being infectious!</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-458"><a id="_idTextAnchor736"/>Infectious Enthusiasm</h2>&#13;
			<p>One of the reasons we advocate<a id="_idIndexMarker3278"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3279"/> starting with one team is to test, learn, inspect, and adapt with a small slice of the organization or department. Starting the right way with a single team and showing rapid success can be incredibly powerful before any kind of spread starts. This team is our Patient Zero.<span id="footnote-188-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-188">2</a></span> By taking this one-team approach first, we are actually taking an Agile approach to moving toward a more Agile way of working.</p>&#13;
			<div id="footnote-188" class="_idFootnote" epub:type="footnote">&#13;
				<p class="FootNote"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-188-backlink">2</a>	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_case">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_case</a></p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>With that first team, we want to enable them to learn as fast as possible by doing everything described in this book and by adopting practices in the Open Practice Library. No training course, YouTube video, or book will ever, on its own, enable a team to instantly work in the way envisioned and achieve the outcomes anticipated by this book. We hope you've got a lot of value from this book and are armed with inspiration and information, but we don't for one moment think your team will instantly transition to this mode of working, even if they read the whole thing cover to cover.</p>&#13;
			<p>People and teams can be enabled by going through the actual journey for themselves. They have to build their own foundation of culture and technology. They have to travel around the Discovery Loop, Options Pivot, and Delivery Loop to experience the Mobius Navigator mindset themselves. In doing this, they need an application, a system, something that delivers real business value to real end users, so they have the opportunity to Build It, Run It, Own It themselves. We advise starting with something that has tangible business value but is also relatively small, so that you can experiment and learn with one small team to start with.</p>&#13;
			<p>Getting one application into production using all the practices and principles described in this book is a challenge and your team will almost certainly identify bottlenecks and blockers throughout the process. The great news is that the Navigator and mental model is built to address this.</p>&#13;
			<p>Being able to improve in the way described in <em class="italics">Chapter 17</em>, <em class="italics">Improve It</em>, enables these bottlenecks and blockers to be addressed, one by one, and validated through metrics. Many of the underlying blockers come from silos in the organization that need to be broken down. The product team, through autonomy, mastery, and purpose, need to be able to silo-bust their way all the way to production!</p>&#13;
			<p>The challenges being surfaced by such a <a id="_idIndexMarker3280"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3281"/>team on a mission to show this new mode of operation need timely resolution, either through platform evolution or leadership enablement. For example, if there is poor or no Product Ownership in place, this blocker needs to be raised through a Retrospective event (as explained in <em class="italics">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italics">Doing Delivery</em>) or the use of the Real-Time Retrospective or even a Stop-the-World event (practices described in <em class="italics">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italics">Open Culture</em>). It's best to identify these problems early on and address them with one team, rather than accepting what we know is sub-optimal and end up scaling inferior ways of working across the organization.</p>&#13;
			<p>Right at the beginning <a id="_idIndexMarker3282"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3283"/>of this book, we explained how we have a saying that we like to <em class="italics">show</em>, <em class="italics">not tell</em>. Show, not tell, is how we create infectious enthusiasm. We have to show the world the people, the process, and the technology working together in full glory. Let's look at a few ways we do this.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-459">De<a id="_idTextAnchor737"/><a id="_idTextAnchor738"/>mo Day</h3>&#13;
			<p>In Red Hat, when we run Open Innovation Labs residencies (4-12 immersive engagements where our customers experience culture and practices on a real business use case), we always finish the <a id="_idIndexMarker3284"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3285"/>engagement with a Demo Day event.  Of course, we run demos throughout the engagement. We typically use Scrum (as described in <em class="italics">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italics">Doing Delivery</em>), which means we run a Sprint Review showcase event every week (we tend to run one-week sprints). </p>&#13;
			<p>While we encourage the idea of <strong class="bold">inviting the world</strong> to these weekly events, practically it is not possible for every developer, operator, leader, engineer, and anyone else connected in the organization to attend. We do record them and try other mediums to get the word out about these weekly showcases, but we find we need an extra-special Demo Day event.</p>&#13;
			<p>Demo Day is a showcase of the entire way of working—the people, the processes, and the technology. In our residency program, it's the people from our customer's organization (also known as the <strong class="bold">residents</strong>) who deliver nearly all of the Demo Day showcase. By this stage, the infectious enthusiasm has already spread to them and this is their opportunity to show (not tell) everything the residents from our customer's organization have done to build, run, and own the product that's been the focus of their residency engagement. This is an opportunity to show their peers and colleagues what they've built, run, and owned; but more importantly, it is an opportunity to show the <em class="italics">how</em> of these stages.</p>&#13;
			<p>This is a showcase of all of the practices the residents used in this time-boxed period of working together, including:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>Their cultural foundation<a id="_idIndexMarker3286"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3287"/> and how they've used practices such as social contracts, Stop-the-World events and Real-Time Retrospectives. They show the team identity they've achieved, how they use team sentiment tools, and how they have created an awesome, thriving team workspace. They explain and show how they used tools<a id="_idIndexMarker3288"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3289"/> such as priority sliders, Definitions of Ready and Done, and acceptance criteria to drive easy conversation, aligned and shared understanding, and a strong open culture.</li>&#13;
				<li>Their technical foundation and how they use containers and the OpenShift platform as the root of their technical foundation. Adding technical practices such as Everything as Code, test-driven <a id="_idIndexMarker3290"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3291"/>development, test automation, CI/CD, and continuous deployment is what really provides a strong platform and foundation for continuous delivery. They show the value they get from pair programming and<a id="_idIndexMarker3292"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3293"/> mob programming to achieve team collective ownership of the product. They show how they have achieved autonomy, mastery, and purpose from this foundation.</li>&#13;
				<li>They walk the walls and explain the Impact Maps, Empathy Maps, Event Storms, Non-Functional Maps, and Metrics-Based Process Maps and how they collectively drove the target measurable outcomes to take the organization toward its North Star.</li>&#13;
				<li>They show how prioritization worked during sprints using User Story Maps, Value Slice Boards, and other prioritization practices they chose to use.</li>&#13;
				<li>They show how the product has evolved, how the architecture has emerged, and the delivery practices used to<a id="_idIndexMarker3294"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3295"/> iteratively and incrementally deliver.</li>&#13;
				<li>They demo the app they've built. They demo the platform capabilities being utilized and show some of the platform features they've utilized to improve operations, drive a more experimental approach to feature development, and radiate real-time metrics.</li>&#13;
				<li>They give some <a id="_idIndexMarker3296"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3297"/>of the mind-blowing metrics that this technology, these practices, and this team have managed to achieve and how they compare to the legacy, status quo way of working.</li>&#13;
				<li>They share directly with their leadership what they need to sustain this way of working and what their hopes and fears are when they return to their normal place of work. </li>&#13;
				<li>They celebrate with pride what they've achieved and what, as a team, they've become.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The infectious enthusiasm is hard to ignore <a id="_idIndexMarker3298"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3299"/>when people are sharing with such passion and energy what they've managed to achieve with the technology and practices they've adopted. Even the most introverted people have delivered incredible showcases at Demo Day. It's something you cannot write down or explain. You need to be there to feel and experience the energy and excitement.</p>&#13;
			<p>Another aspect we often try to build into Demo Day is to show a typical day in the life or sprint in the life of the team. To do this, we create lots of videos during our engagements.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-460"><a id="_idTextAnchor739"/>Documenting the Journey</h3>&#13;
			<p>It's hard to articulate in writing or even verbally the power of collaboration. When a team is Event Storming and has a strong open culture in place, it's just amazing to watch how the conversations align. When a team comes together to prioritize and refine Product Backlogs, the business and technical clarifications achieved and the decisions made are very powerful, especially when compared to the status quo approach to planning work. All the fun, energy, and banter that gives a team such awesome culture cannot be communicated in words.</p>&#13;
			<p>So, we try to capture that as much as possible through photos and videos. It's why we've included lots of photos in this book to<a id="_idIndexMarker3300"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3301"/> try and show, not tell, the culture and these practices in operation.</p>&#13;
			<p>We encourage everyone to work in or near teams to photograph and video everything (with permission of those around, of course!) as much as possible. Even in a four-week engagement, we end up with literally hundreds of photos and videos.</p>&#13;
			<p>To create infectious <a id="_idIndexMarker3302"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3303"/>enthusiasm, members of our team tend to compile a weekly showcase video. This isn't a professionally made video but something fun, a couple of minutes with a montage of photos and short videos that just gives others a glimpse of what it feels like in the team space. We show these to the teams (normally on a Friday afternoon), which provides a sense of pride and reward. We get feedback that team members show these videos to their families, which tends to be a good sign that they are loving what they are doing!</p>&#13;
			<p>We encourage our customers to share these videos and photos around their wider organization, especially with those who may benefit or be inspired to see this one team working this way and may not have a chance to visit them. Some even end up on YouTube,<span id="footnote-187-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-187">3</a></span> which is a great way to show the world!</p>&#13;
			<p>While photos and videos provide a glimpse of a team over a period of time, we also look for creative ways to summarize a longer period of time or an entire engagement. One approach that has worked really well is to sketch the experience.</p>&#13;

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-461"><a id="_idTextAnchor740"/>Sketching the Experience</h3>&#13;
			<p>Hopefully, you've <a id="_idIndexMarker3304"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3305"/>noticed the value that sketching and doodling can bring to areas of complexity. Ilaria Doria has provided <a id="_idIndexMarker3306"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3307"/>many amazing sketches throughout this book to bring the content to life a little bit more and show, not tell, the practice.</p>&#13;
			<p>This is another approach that works really well at telling a story and documenting an experience. We have sometimes engaged graphic artists to document Demo Day as seen in <em class="italics">Figure 18.3</em>. There's a lot of detail in the image that may not all be readable in print. You can, of course, access the digital version using the book's GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/DevOps-Culture-and-Practice-with-OpenShift/">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/DevOps-Culture-and-Practice-with-OpenShift/</a> and zoom in.</p>&#13;
			<p>There is also an excellent three-part series of blog posts<span id="footnote-186-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-186">4</a></span> all about this particular engagement written by Eric Schabell that also includes the sketch.</p>&#13;

			<p>These sketches have hung proudly in public areas of the organization's headquarters. They stimulate interest and provide inspiration and another source of infectious enthusiasm. These visuals often encompass everything you might see if you came on a walk-the-walls tour of the team space.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-462"><a id="_idTextAnchor741"/>Walk the Walls</h3>&#13;
			<p>One of the very best mechanisms we have found to create infectious enthusiasm is through a practice called walk the walls. In <em class="italics">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italics">Open Culture</em>, we discussed the tremendous value we get from visualizing work and <a id="_idIndexMarker3308"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3309"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3310"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3311"/>creating the many Information Radiators we have learned about in this book. In <em class="italics">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italics">Open Environment and Open Leadership</em>, we explained the important success factors of an organization's leadership team giving teams open workspaces to show and use all of these information radiators. Walk the walls brings both of these together and delivers a truly engaging and immersive experience to anyone that might be interested in seeing this way of working happen with their own eyes. The idea is that people going on a walk-the-walls tour should be able to get all of the information they would ever want or need about the team, its product, the technology being used, and their way of working. Simply looking at the information radiator artifacts and having a conversation with whoever is giving the tour (usually a member in the team or someone close to it) provides an honest, energetic, and humbling experience to learn about the people, processes, and technology at play.</p>&#13;
			<p>Walk-the-walls tours are not rehearsed and do not follow a script. We simply talk about what we see and tell stories about how we built what we're seeing: the Big Picture, the Practice Corner, Impact Maps, Event Storms, the North Star, Metrics-Based Process Maps, Value Slice Boards, Product Backlogs, Sprint Boards, Retrospective results, build monitors, test metrics, deployment statistics, operational dashboards, and many, many more. A great walk-the-walls experience is more<a id="_idIndexMarker3312"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3313"/> than simply <strong class="bold">Show, Not Tell</strong>—it's <strong class="bold">Feel and Show, not Tell</strong>. A high-performing team has a sense of autonomy, mastery, and purpose, uses great open cultural practices, and adopts the best technology available on a world-class platform. When you see such a team practicing all of this, it's hard not to feel the culture and energy in the room. That is what is truly infectious. Any teams-to-be walking the walls and feeling this energy tend to want in—and to be as this team is.</p>&#13;
			<p>We have tried <a id="_idIndexMarker3314"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3315"/>to bring to life a couple of walk-the-walls experiences for both an in-person product team<span id="footnote-185-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-185">5</a></span> and a virtual product team.<span id="footnote-184-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-184">6</a></span></p>&#13;
			<p>Where we can't have every team and every stakeholder visit the team and walk the walls with them, we look for other mediums to help show the world the team and technology in action through, for example, what we call <strong class="bold">Written Showcases</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-463">Writ<a id="_idTextAnchor742"/><a id="_idTextAnchor743"/>ten Showcases</h3>&#13;
			<p>Written Showcases are <a id="_idIndexMarker3316"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3317"/>exactly what they say they are—Showcase events but written down! We started doing these on a weekly basis where we would be frustrated that the weekly Sprint Review Showcase event would not be as well attended as we'd hoped for. We'd invited senior leaders, stakeholders, and other teams to come and walk the walls but, in a busy world, it's hard to get everyone to visit—especially in a time-boxed engagement of perhaps just a few weeks to enable and kick-start this team.</p>&#13;
			<p>So, we write down all the things we want to tell our stakeholders in Sprint Review showcase events and walk the walls. And we show as much as possible through colorful photos, links, and montage videos.</p>&#13;
			<p>These written Showcases often take the form of an HTML email or a PDF (so, all the photos and videos) that includes links to artifacts and information radiators and the latest metrics collected from the evolving application, software delivery, and platform.</p>&#13;
			<p>It's difficult to give a written document the same level of visual appeal as an engaging and immersive walk-the-walls tour. But we can try, and the great advantage is that such documents can be shared far and wide in the organization and word of mouth becomes a trigger of infectious enthusiasm.</p>&#13;

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-464"><a id="_idTextAnchor744"/>Word of Mouth</h3>&#13;
			<p>Word of mouth in the<a id="_idIndexMarker3318"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3319"/> field has proven to us time and time again to be a key ingredient of sustaining and growing the culture that we are seeing with one team. After a few weeks of being invited to Sprint Review Showcase events and walk-the-walls tours, receiving written showcase emails, and seeing photos and videos of what looks like some awesome team and techie stuff happening, the team in question gets talked about.</p>&#13;
			<p>We start to hear chats in the corridor such as, "<em class="italics">Have you seen those folks up on the 5th floor? Sticky notes and monitors everywhere</em>…<em class="italics">not sure what they're doing but it sure does look interesting</em>" or "<em class="italics">We need to go and see that product team who have been in the basement the last few weeks; they seem to be doing some awesome techie shizzles and I'm sure we can learn from them</em>" or even, "<em class="italics">I've just done this walk</em> <em class="italics">the</em> <em class="italics">walls thing with that team downstairs—they're doing all the stuff you read and learn about on training courses but they're doing it so much better and for real!</em>"</p>&#13;
			<p>And the conversation goes on when you see some of the metrics around software delivery and operability. Word of mouth gets around about some of the amazing outcomes that one team is achieving. How can others not want to learn more?</p>&#13;

			<p>In <em class="italics">Chapter 17</em>, <em class="italics">Improve It</em>, we<a id="_idIndexMarker3320"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3321"/> shared a story about how a Product Owner needed to prove the value of DevOps using metrics to his Leadership Team and how he used Metrics-Based Process Mapping as a practice to enable this.</p>&#13;
			<p>The headline metrics in <em class="italics">Table 17.1</em> showed improvements in getting new features into production over 34 times faster using a long-lived product team (as opposed to a project team), new ways of working (as opposed to the legacy Waterfall project management methodology), and a world-class container platform (as opposed to VMs).</p>&#13;
			<p>The metrics do not lie. They are collected from the underlying systems and tools that have helped effect this change. When we <a id="_idIndexMarker3322"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3323"/>showcase these metrics in addition to showing all the practices and demonstrations, we are not talking about cost savings. Instead, we are shifting the focus to value creation and value realized. It leaves stakeholders and leadership thinking about the impact this can have on their business if they can get the highest-level features, applications, and capabilities into the hands of users 34 times more quickly than what they are used to.</p>&#13;
			<p>And this is just one team. What if all teams in the organization could work like this one? This one team has provided an inspirational blueprint for change by showing the art of the possible.</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p>Continuing the story from <em class="italics">Chapter 17</em>,<em class="italics"> Improve It</em>, about the need for metrics to explain the benefits of DevOps Culture and Practices that they'd now experienced for six weeks, what happened next?</p>&#13;
			<p>The team had been working in a pop-up lab for this residency engagement, so the first step was to move them back to their own offices.</p>&#13;
			<p>And it was more than just moving the people. All the boards, all the artifacts, all the information radiators, all the monitors, all the sticky notes—they all had to be moved too!</p>&#13;
			<p>We hired removal men to wrap them up and move them.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer581" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/B16297_18_05.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>Figure 18.5: Moving boards and information radiators to show and inspire others</p>&#13;
			<p>Through the support of the Leadership Team of this organization, a space was secured at the site where many of their IT teams worked from.</p>&#13;
			<p>There had been a lot of word of mouth about this team. Written showcases had been shared weekly, which included an <a id="_idIndexMarker3324"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3325"/>informal fun weekly video. Thousands of photos and short videos had been captured, which, along with all the artifacts created during the residency, were all shared back to the organization's own SharePoint servers. And, of course, those metrics were going viral around the organization!</p>&#13;
			<p>Keeping the team together and keeping their tools (including all those boards) was the most important first step. They did this.</p>&#13;
			<p>The space they worked in became known as The Board Room!</p>&#13;
			<p>More walk-the-walls tours, more enablement and training sessions, and many more conversations with a growing number of other teams and parts of the organization followed.</p>&#13;
			<p>The team still had a product to evolve further and deploy into more users' hands around the world.</p>&#13;
			<p>About six months later, I received an email from the same Product Owner who we talked about in <em class="italics">Chapter 17</em>,<em class="italics"> Improve It</em>, with the need for metrics. First, he talked about the app: </p>&#13;
			<p>"<em class="italics">Yes, [the application] is live in production globally on all 89 markets. It's working quite well and aside from minor issues it's been running flawlessly.</em>"</p>&#13;
			<p>He went on to explain how their CI/CD practices have continued to improve—"<em class="italics">We've continued to push code to production on a more or less daily basis; our record at the moment is 3 deploys within two hours and the pipeline execution time is down to about 20 minutes with a whopping total of 128 test cases part of the regression</em>."</p>&#13;
			<p>And, finally, he told me how this approach was organically scaling, through infectious enthusiasm to other teams—"<em class="italics">It's super exciting to be part of transforming a bigger part of the organization. I'm now responsible for 7 teams. Feels like we've hit the ground running and are making good progress even if we still have some ways to go.</em>"</p>&#13;
			<p>One more thing. He gave me an updated version of the slide he'd previously used at Demo Day. The process improvement of getting new functionality done into production was no longer 34 times better than the legacy practices and legacy technology. It was now 105 times faster.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer1012" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/B16297_Table_18.1.png" alt="" style="height:300px; width:600px;"/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>Table 18.1: Metrics-based benefits of using new DevOps Culture and Practices</p>&#13;
			<p>This is a great example of <a id="_idIndexMarker3326"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3327"/>continuous improvement!</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>What is great about this story is that the culture and practices were subject to immediate scaling. We saw the journey of ensuring the product team continued to perform and improve underpinned by the metrics. I believe several impediments and blockers had to be fixed by leadership to enable this. The proof point was scaling the team's application operationally across 89 markets while interest and infectious enthusiasm grew across the business.</p>&#13;
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor747"/>And eventually, some of the key people involved in making that <em class="italics">one team, one dream</em> a success progressed to enabling seven teams to work, behave, and think in the same way.<a id="_idTextAnchor748"/></p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-467"><a id="_idTextAnchor749"/>More Teams, More Application Products</h2>&#13;
			<p>When we are ready to unleash that infectious enthusiasm and enable more Application Product Teams to work in the same<a id="_idIndexMarker3328"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3329"/> mode as the first one has, what does that look like?</p>&#13;
			<p>We've seen throughout this book how a team built its own foundation—cultural foundation, enabled by leadership, and a technical foundation. We've seen how that team journeyed around the Discovery Loop through the Options Pivot and onto the Delivery Loop, and based on learning either looped around Delivery again, returned to the Discovery Loop, or returned to the Options Pivot. This journey continues forever.</p>&#13;
			<p>This is what five <a id="_idIndexMarker3330"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3331"/>Application Product Teams' approaches would look like, as seen in <em class="italics">Figure 18.6</em>. Each of them is an autonomous team with mastery and purpose, focused on their individual product (or product area if they're delivering into a larger product). So, they each have their own Mobius Loop to journey around. They each have their own foundation of culture, their unique team culture. They each have their own technical foundation that they can continuously improve.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer583" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/B16297_18_07.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 18.6: Lots of Mobius Loops representing lots of products in an organization</p>&#13;
			<p>There is one addition. All the teams need to be supported by an underpinning foundation. This foundation is also made up of a cultural and a technical part. The cultural part enables teams to safely collaborate, share, and learn together using techniques such as inner-source and communities of practice. The technical part of the underpinning foundation is heavily contributed to by the platform, such as OpenShift, which underpins all the technical practices being applied by the adopting teams. How do we bring additional teams into this whole ecosystem? How do we add them to the platform?</p>&#13;
			<p>First, every team needs to go through some kind of enablement. They need to build their own foundation of culture and technology. They need to understand their Why. They need to be involved in their own Discovery Loop and Delivery Loops. We strongly believe that there is a need for three iterations in any team's enablement.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-468"><a id="_idTextAnchor750"/>The Power of Three Iterations in Enablement</h2>&#13;
			<p>It always seems to be three. When we do something new and then repeat it and then repeat it again, it's the third iteration where things start to click. Sometimes it takes longer and more iterations (especially where complexity is high), but three is the minimum number of iterations that any<a id="_idIndexMarker3332"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3333"/> team should consider to go through an immersive, learn-by-doing, enablement experience. This is why our Open Innovation Labs residencies are always between 4 and 12 weeks in duration. A four-week residency means the team can take a few days to build their foundation, a few days to go round the Discovery Loop and Options Pivot, and then do three one-week Delivery Loop iterations using Scrum. Each iteration of the Delivery Loop will deliver an increment of working software that is potentially shippable to production. These iterations are kick-starting the continuous incremental delivery of the application product.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now, this may not be enough to achieve outcomes and many customers will want to get back to Discovery and/or do more Delivery Loop iterations, hence six- and eight-week residencies are <a id="_idIndexMarker3334"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3335"/>more common. But it's always in that third Delivery Loop or third Sprint where people really start to get it. They <a id="_idIndexMarker3336"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3337"/>realize that one of these Showcases is going to happen every Wednesday at 3 PM. They realize that there'll be a written Showcase with a fun video on Friday afternoon. They realized that that will explain what has been loaded into the new sprint that was planned on Thursday mornings. It becomes a pattern and a rhythm that team members and stakeholders can feel increasingly confident about. And, most importantly, we start to see the impact of continuous improvement in metrics after three iterations.</p>&#13;

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-469" class="Author-Heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor751"/>The App Does Something This Week That It Didn’t Do Last Week!</h2>&#13;
			<div>&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>Working with a global oil customer in 2017, we used a four-week Open Innovation Labs residency to reimagine one of their pricing applications using DevOps Culture and Practices. Of course, this meant bringing the user into the process much earlier, and with much more collaboration. </p>&#13;
			<p>I managed to get the time and support of an asset economist who was one of the key users of the application in question. She had never met a software development team, never mind worked with them, so this was a whole new world to her.</p>&#13;
			<p>She didn't attend the Sprint 1 Showcase. She did attend the Sprint 2 Showcase and was hugely frustrated because so much of the functionality that she expected to see was missing from this replacement app that she relied on in her job. She, of course, had not really grasped that this was an early product increment and still <a id="_idIndexMarker3338"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3339"/>very early in development. But she did provide feedback on a few things she saw demonstrated that were wrong.</p>&#13;
			<p>The following week was the last Sprint Review showcase and she attended again. This time, she saw some of her feedback had been addressed and some (not all) of the new features were starting to go into the application.</p>&#13;
			<p>The penny dropped and all <a id="_idIndexMarker3340"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3341"/>became clear: she realized that the app was evolving with her involved. This week, it did stuff it didn't do last week. And the team had managed to take in her feedback and address it in less than a week! A very different experience to the usual user acceptance testing sign-offs she would use after several months of siloed development.</p>&#13;
			<p>It was the third iteration where this positive realization took place.</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>So, we've <a id="_idIndexMarker3342"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3343"/>established that every new team needs to go round the Mobius Loop at least three times to be engaged and immersed in using the platform and DevOps Culture and Practices. What about the foundation?</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-470"><a id="_idTextAnchor752"/>Bolster the Foundations</h2>&#13;
			<p>This is where we<a id="_idIndexMarker3344"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3345"/> do <em class="italics">not</em> do a copy and paste of that first team's foundation. Teams need to build their own foundations. They also need to regularly nurture and bolster their own foundations. And where they are connected by culture and technology, they all need to contribute to their connected underlying foundation.</p>&#13;
			<p>When we introduced the Open Practice Library in <em class="italics">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italics">Introducing DevOps and Some Tools</em>, we explained that this is a community-driven repository of tools. Throughout the book, we've pulled out around 50 of our favorite tools in the Open Practice Library toolbox and explained how we use them together to deliver metrics-based outcomes that matter.</p>&#13;
			<p>These are not necessarily the practices that every team should use. Just because a set of practices works so well for one team does not mean they will work equally well for every subsequent team. Practices used to build the foundation and navigate around the Mobius Loop need to emerge and react to the specific context and needs of the team at the time in question.</p>&#13;
			<p>This means every team may mix up their practices compared to any other team.</p>&#13;
			<p>To draw a comparison, let's think about what happens when your toilet breaks in your house. It can be a very stressful experience losing a piece of equipment so vital in the home! Assuming you're not an experienced toilet-fixer, you will probably call a plumber. Now, when the plumber arrives at your house, we suspect you don't greet the plumber by telling him or her what tools they're going to use and in what order and for how long. You expect the plumber to arrive with a van and/or a toolbox of everything he or she will need to investigate the problem, confirm the exact nature of the cause and what is needed to correct it, assess the options for making the fix (perhaps with some recommendations), make the fix, test it and ensure the problem is fixed and won't happen again, and clean up. The plumber will more than likely need a few tools to do this. You don't tell them what tools to use. You expect them, the experts, to do that!</p>&#13;
			<p>It's the same with our product teams. This is why we shouldn't give teams a prescriptive, step-by-step set of tools and methods and expect them just to act on them. With autonomy, mastery, and purpose, we need them to pick the tools and practices they want to use and we expect them to arrive with the very best ones to get the job done to the best of their ability. And if a tool or practice isn't working out (either at first or after some time), throw it back in the toolbox and try another, a better one! Through the sharing of experience and forming communities across teams, organizations can find the very best tools and practices as informed by the teams on the ground.</p>&#13;
			<p>As we explained in <em class="italics">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italics">Doing Delivery</em>, we also need to look for when to bring the guardrails down that some of these practices provide. Just because a product team started using practices associated with the Scrum framework and worked really well for a few months, doesn't mean that these practices should be used forever for that team. Teams seeking to continuously improve need to inspect themselves and recognize when a practice they've been using successfully for some time might actually be counterproductive and a bottleneck.</p>&#13;
			<p>Having a common underpinning foundation of culture and technology is what allows many teams to successfully travel around the Mobius Loop. This means creating a culture where teams <a id="_idIndexMarker3346"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3347"/>learn from each other, and infectious enthusiasm continues to evolve—not just from the first team but by subsequent teams and organizations. Much of our experience comes from open source communities where sometimes many thousands of people connect to serve a common purpose and iteratively and incrementally deliver on this. We're seeing and helping organizations use the principles of open source to form communities inside organizations. The practice of inner-sourcing allows collaboration, contribution, and openness across the organization. They achieve this by forming Communities of Practice and Communities of Interest. <strong class="bold">Communities of Practice</strong> (<strong class="bold">CoPs</strong>) provide a space <a id="_idIndexMarker3348"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3349"/>where people from different teams who hold particular specialist skillsets can collaborate, share, ideate, and inspire. Good examples include UI/UX CoPs, Product Ownership CoPs, or an OpenShift CoP. <strong class="bold">Communities of Interest</strong> (<strong class="bold">CoIs</strong>) can be on any<a id="_idIndexMarker3350"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3351"/> topic of interest to anyone and related to something inside or outside the organization. Inner-sourcing and CoPs help to provide and bolster the underpinning foundation of culture that multiple teams can leverage sustainably and gain from.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's look at some ideas on how we might sustain technology.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-471"><a id="_idTextAnchor753"/>Sustaining the Technology</h2>&#13;
			<p>Anyone who has a career in IT will tell <a id="_idIndexMarker3352"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3353"/>you that one of the biggest challenges is keeping up to date with all of the technology. In the world today, a very large percentage of us are always connected to the internet.<span id="footnote-183-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-183">7</a></span> The growth and numbers are staggering, especially when you consider that back at the start of the 1990s (when the authors of this book were leaving university), only ~5% of the developed world were connected to the internet. The pace of change is endless.</p>&#13;
			<div id="footnote-183" class="_idFootnote" epub:type="footnote">&#13;
				<p class="FootNote"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-183-backlink">7</a>	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage</a></p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>It is with this backdrop in mind that we evolve our applications and services atop a platform that has grown from its first commit in 2014, shown in <em class="italics">Figure 18.7</em>, to the most prevalent container orchestration platform today.</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer585" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/B16297_18_08.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 18.7: First Kubernetes commit</p>&#13;
			<p>For technologists, the <a id="_idIndexMarker3354"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3355"/>challenge is keeping pace with this rate of change. To <em class="italics">not</em> change is one option. However, it can be a fatal option; think Betamax and cassette tapes and Perl (so sad)! We have said a few times in this book that we are optimizing a certain thing to minimize for the cost of change. We need to minimize the amount of time it takes to modify or change a software deployment pipeline, to enhance it, or to give us faster feedback. We need to minimize the time it takes to get ideas from our customers and business into working software solutions in production. We need to minimize the time it takes to update the platform. These drives to minimize time are based on the realization that <em class="italics">time is money</em> in business and organizations, and that it is often better to be <em class="italics">fast</em> than <em class="italics">right.</em> Gaining faster feedback allows teams to pivot and change faster based on their business and customer needs.</p>&#13;
			<p>So, how can technologists sustain this? We do this by continually learning, evolving the long-lived team's shared knowledge and understanding of technology and solutions that are continuously evolving and adapting. Practices such as pair programming and mobbing bring to life this continual learning experience. It takes technical excellence that can be shared and understood by the team, combined with the people and processes practices described in this book, to win.</p>&#13;
			<p>Businesses small and large are building their business platforms atop a myriad of vendor platforms. This <a id="_idIndexMarker3356"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3357"/>platform mindset is critical in today's hybrid cloud. One of the main reasons for the success of the platform mindset is that platforms can become a place where shared and common best practices are codified among different teams. If the public cloud has taught us anything, it is that the right platform and infrastructure is a real sustainable competitive advantage. OpenShift is positioned to be the platform your organization and teams develop and continuously deploy business application services upon, wherever your infrastructure is deployed. </p>&#13;
			<p>Lifecycle managing these platform architectures is a core skill that every organization has to deal with. Many of the intricacies are managed <em class="italics">as</em> <em class="italics">a</em> <em class="italics">service</em> in the hybrid cloud; this lowers the operational burden for your product teams. In OpenShift, with the operator pattern, all of the expert knowledge can be codified, shared, and updated over time to help automate and <a id="_idIndexMarker3358"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3359"/>manage the individual pieces that make up the platform. Perhaps most importantly, the operator pattern was used to unify the operating system with the platform, making the OpenShift platform installation and life cycle far easier from a user's perspective. Practices have also evolved to take on this life cycle challenge. Site reliability engineering is a discipline born from traditional IT operations and infrastructure that codifies best practices for teams managing these platforms in all their possible guises.</p>&#13;
			<p>To adopt a learning mentality is to accept that what you know today is not necessarily going to be enough for the changes and challenges that lie ahead. For us, innovation, research, and development happens in the open source communities of the world. You can tap into this and become part of this through commercial open source, which in turn becomes a competitive advantage to your organization. Commercial open source software projects are owned by a single company that derives a direct and significant revenue stream from the software through subscriptions, services, training, and support.</p>&#13;
			<p>Being adaptive to<a id="_idIndexMarker3360"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3361"/> change is <a id="_idIndexMarker3362"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3363"/>critical in any DevOps or transformation agenda. So many times have we come across DevOps done wrong, and often they come down to these seven items. Watch out for these anti-patterns and know how to respond to them appropriately as, if you don't, they can lead you down a dark path:</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer586" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;
					<img src="../Images/figure-18-8.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 18.8: Seven anti-patterns and what DevOps is NOT</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li>DevOps is <strong class="bold">not</strong> a one-person band: "<em class="italics">Yeah, we do DevOps, Mary is here Tuesdays and Thursdays and she manages our pipelines</em>." So often do we come across phrases like "<em class="italics">The DevOps person,</em>" but this is an anti-pattern. DevOps is not just one team either; it's a desire to want to work a certain way. To want to take end-to-end responsibility for the <a id="_idIndexMarker3364"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3365"/>software's journey and break down walls that impede feedback loops. It's not some gun for hire that swans in and fixes everything before saddling up and heading back out of town.</li>&#13;
				<li>DevOps is <strong class="bold">not</strong> a one-time thing: Following on from this gun-for-hire analogy, DevOps is not a one-time thing. It's not just a matter of configuring a pipeline once and it's static forever. Like all technology, these things need to be nurtured and evolved. As new components get added to your architecture or new software becomes available, your pipeline and process need to evolve too.</li>&#13;
				<li>DevOps is <strong class="bold">not</strong> the cloud: Using services from the cloud or just deploying a Kubernetes cluster does not mean you're now doing DevOps. It's how you use the platform as an enabler and view it as a product that can accelerate any transformational journey.</li>&#13;
				<li>DevOps is <strong class="bold">not </strong>giving root/admin access to everyone: This one should feel cut and dry, but doing DevOps does not just mean giving the access to production and to the developers. It's about developers and site reliability engineers working together, listening to each other's concerns, and optimizing your delivery capabilities with trusted and reliable pipelines.</li>&#13;
				<li>DevOps is <strong class="bold">not </strong>just the tools: Just because you're using Jenkins or Tekton does not mean you're doing DevOps. The tools are only a vehicle that can enable teams to work together on a shared platform and space. The real goal is<a id="_idIndexMarker3366"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3367"/> creating ownership of the software stack and a feedback loop that connects users through to development to increase speed to market.</li>&#13;
				<li>DevOps is <strong class="bold">not </strong>a silver bullet: It's all about <em class="italics">the people, the process, and the technology</em> combined and balanced. Doing DevOps is not going to solve all your problems; it's just one aspect.</li>&#13;
				<li>DevOps is <strong class="bold">not</strong> a <a id="_idIndexMarker3368"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3369"/>distinct team: If your <strong class="bold">software development life cycle</strong> (<strong class="bold">SDLC</strong>) consists of developers building code and then throwing it over the wall to the DevOps team to deploy/manage, then you need to reevaluate your SDLC.</li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>Now, if the idea of <em class="italics">the DevOps Team</em> is such an anti-pattern, the question needs to be asked, "<em class="italics">Is the same true for the idea of a</em> <strong class="bold">Platform Team</strong>?"</p>&#13;
			<p>Our first inclination may be that it is. If we truly want to bring down all silos and have a fully cross-functional product team, surely that should mean platform expertise is included in the team? Surely one or two of the T-shaped <a id="_idIndexMarker3370"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3371"/>or M-shaped people we defined in <em class="italics">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italics">Introduction</em> – <em class="italics">Start with Why</em>, should be specialists in the platform?</p>&#13;
			<p>This has been a debate we've been having for several years, and perspectives do start to change when we start to consider many product teams all working on a common platform. This is a problem of scale. Of course, one of the goals of having a <a id="_idIndexMarker3372"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3373"/>platform in the first place is to solve this problem of scaling and reuse. It provides an underpinning technical foundation for many teams to accelerate their development with. A single product team like the PetBattle team will get many benefits from a platform. But, if PetBattle were to get acquired by Pet Planet—a new Pet Tech firm with 50 product teams—the economies-of-scale benefits offered by the platform grow exponentially.</p>&#13;
			<p>Recently, we've been <a id="_idIndexMarker3374"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3375"/>inspired by and resonate heavily with the work of Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais, who wrote the book <em class="italics">Team Topologies</em>. They introduce different team topologies, which <a id="_idIndexMarker3376"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3377"/>include:</p>&#13;

				<li value="1">The Enabling Team, who help train, coach, and guide a team to learn new practices and acquire new skills, much like we do on our Open Innovation Labs residency program.</li>&#13;
				<li>The Stream Aligned Team, which is a team aligned to a single, valuable stream of work. The Application Product Teams we have referred to throughout this book align closely to this.</li>&#13;
				<li>The Platform Team, which has a purpose to enable stream-aligned teams to deliver work with substantial autonomy.</li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>The reason we support the idea of a Platform Team and don't see it as an anti-pattern like the DevOps team is because the platform is a product and should be treated as a product. Where Skelton and Pais differentiate between Stream Aligned Teams and Platform Teams, we see both of these teams as Product Teams.</p>&#13;
			<p>This book has been all about how Product Teams should operate and what is involved in taking a product mentality to a team's subject. We visualize any product mental model using the Mobius Loop and foundation.</p>&#13;

			<p>So, how does the <a id="_idIndexMarker3378"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3379"/>platform Mobius Loop work? Turn to <em class="italics">Page 1</em> of this book! It's exactly the same! We treat the platform as a Complex product, which means we perform continuous discovery, Options Pivoting, and continuous delivery.</p>&#13;

			<p>A Platform Team can use the same Discovery practices as we introduced in <em class="italics">Section 3</em>, <em class="italics">Discover It</em>. Rather than <a id="_idIndexMarker3380"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3381"/>discovering a business application, they are using these practices to discover the platform. For example:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>A Platform Team can have its own<a id="_idIndexMarker3382"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3383"/> North Star metric, as described in <em class="italics">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italics">Discovering the Why and Who</em>. This gives a single metric that best captures the core value that the platform delivers to its customers or, more specifically, Application Product Teams.</li>&#13;
				<li>A Platform Team can have its own Impact Map, as described in <em class="italics">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italics">Discovering the Why and Who</em>, deliverables that can be built into the platform, and the measurable impact we hypothesize these would have on actors (such as developers) to help<a id="_idIndexMarker3384"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3385"/> achieve the platform's goal.</li>&#13;
				<li>A Platform Team can use Empathy Mapping and other human-centered design techniques to build empathy with, say, developers in Application Product Teams. This is very powerful in avoiding a common anti-pattern being mandated across the organization; it creates a pull from the development community who want a platform that will help them and solve pain points.</li>&#13;
				<li>A Platform Team can use Event Storming as described in <em class="italics">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italics">Discovering the How</em>, to map out the processes developers use or want to use to get best use out of the platform. This enables the platform architecture to emerge. We can also use practices such as Non-Functional Mapping and Metrics-Based Process Mapping to trigger a continuous delivery approach with measures on the platform.</li>&#13;
				<li>A Platform Team can set target measurable outcomes as outlined in <em class="italics">Chapter 10</em>, <em class="italics">Setting Outcomes</em>.</li>&#13;
				<li>A Platform Team can organize and prioritize its work using practices such as User Story Mapping, Value Slicing, Impact and Effort Prioritization, How-Now-Wow Prioritization, and Weight-Shortest-Job-First to build a platform Product Backlog prioritized by value delivered to Application Product Teams. Design of experiments, design sprints, and even considering the advanced deployment concepts to roll out new platform capabilities can all be used by Platform Teams.</li>&#13;
				<li>Platforms are complex systems as <a id="_idIndexMarker3386"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3387"/>defined by Cynefin and explained in <em class="italics">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italics">Doing Delivery</em>. This means they benefit from being delivered iteratively and incrementally with learning and feedback built in. An Agile delivery approach such as <a id="_idIndexMarker3388"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3389"/>Scrum or Kanban allows <a id="_idIndexMarker3390"/>platforms to be showcased to developers and operators iteratively and allows metrics and learning to be collected.</li>&#13;
				<li>Platform Teams need to have their own foundation. Platform Teams need to have autonomy, mastery, and purpose themselves. They need their own technical foundation so they can apply practices such as Everything as Code, the Big Picture, and CI/CD as explained in <em class="italics">Section 2</em>, <em class="italics">Establishing the Foundation</em>. The technical foundation of the Platform Team is twice as important; not only does it provide a foundation for emerging platform development, but it morphs into the technical foundation of all Application Product Teams.</li>&#13;
				<li>Platform Teams can work in spaces full of information radiation, collaboration, and openness just like Application Product Teams. In fact, the most important collaboration is with those Application Product Teams.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>How do Platform and <a id="_idIndexMarker3391"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3392"/>Application Product Teams interconnect? How do their respective loops interconnect? Developers and other members of Application Product Teams are the users and the stakeholders of the Platform Team. The decision and motivation to use a platform has to come from the power of those users and not a top-down management decision. Platform Teams evolve the platform and infrastructure to serve needs and opportunities and address problems that developers and Application Product Teams are having.</p>&#13;

			</div>&#13;
			<p>One of the best feedback loops I witnessed between Platform Teams and Application Teams is in our Open Innovation Labs space in London, where we often have engineers from the Red Hat OpenShift business unit working in the space.</p>&#13;
			<p>We also run Open Innovation Labs residencies in the same space where our customers are using OpenShift, sometimes for the first time, and also learning DevOps Culture and Practices using OpenShift.</p>&#13;
			<p>Where there is an opportunity to connect OpenShift engineering to our customers, we seize it. There is a two-fold benefit. Our customers get to meet the engineers behind the core platform product they are using, can hear directly from them on upcoming features, roadmap items, and more; and our OpenShift engineers get to see real customers using their product! They get to see how and why they're using it, what's working well, and what isn't. It's an awesome feedback loop.</p>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p>Two of the worst <a id="_idIndexMarker3393"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3394"/>anti-patterns we see are where management makes a product decision without talking to users, and where management makes a platform decision without talking to developers and operators.</p>&#13;
			<p>So, what can management take away from this and what can Leadership Teams learn from the double Mobius mental model to platform and application product continuous discovery and continuous delivery? What if organizational leadership and strategy was also treated as a complex product?</p>&#13;
			<div>&#13;
				<div id="_idContainer589" class="IMG---Figure">&#13;

				</div>&#13;
			</div>&#13;
			<p class="figure">Figure 18.10: Mobius ecosystem of leadership, products, and platform</p>&#13;
			<p>If an organization's<a id="_idIndexMarker3395"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3396"/> strategy is to be treated as a complex product, that means leadership taking a continuous discovery, Options Pivot, and continuous delivery approach.</p>&#13;
			<p>Product Ownership of strategy needs to understand the context and motivation of the market, informed by information visualized by product teams (just as Product Owners of Application Product Teams need to understand the context and motivations of users and business stakeholders; just as Product Owners of Platform Teams need to understand the context and motivations of developers and operators).</p>&#13;
			<p>Leadership needs its own foundation and needs to inject stability into the product and platform foundation. In some cases, this means removing the <em class="italics">rotting foundation</em> from legacy processes. Examples we see of this include the way HR, financial, legal, and risk processes are conducted. All of these benefit from a <a id="_idIndexMarker3397"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3398"/>product mindset and being tightly connected to their users' empathy.</p>&#13;
			<p>If we revisit once again the practices introduced in the different sections of this book, we can see how they can be applied by a Leadership Team taking <a id="_idIndexMarker3399"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3400"/>a product mindset toward its strategy. For example:</p>&#13;
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">&#13;
				<li>Every strategy should <a id="_idIndexMarker3401"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3402"/>have a North Star.</li>&#13;
				<li>Impact Mapping has been used by many organizations to drive the organization's company strategy, articulated by a goal, actors, target impacts, and deliverables.</li>&#13;
				<li>Practice such as Event Storming, Empathy Mapping, and other human-centered design can be used to gain shared understanding and empathy with shareholders, financial stakeholders, owners, competitors, and other market forces.</li>&#13;
				<li>The Options Pivot practices in <em class="italics">Section 5</em>, <em class="italics">Deliver It</em>, can be used to prioritize work, design experiments, and even consider advanced deployment of products into the market.</li>&#13;
				<li>The Delivery practices in <em class="italics">Section 6</em>, <em class="italics">Build It, Run It, Own It</em>, can be used to deliver increments of the strategy in an Agile way and run Showcases (to the company and the market) and Retrospectives to continuously improve. Measure what matters and continuously learn. Capture and radiate organizational metrics and drive learning and continuous improvement.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>The outcome of <a id="_idIndexMarker3403"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3404"/>Leadership Strategy as a Product is to set the intent for Application Product teams. Product Teams set the intent to Platform Teams. All teams are informed by measures, learning, and visualization—both to improve themselves and to radiate up from platform to product, and then to leadership.</p>&#13;
			<p>The final practice from the toolbox of practices to help connect these is called <strong class="bold">Objectives and Key Results</strong>, or <strong class="bold">OKRs</strong>.</p>&#13;
			<p>OKRs comprise <a id="_idIndexMarker3405"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3406"/>an <strong class="bold">objective</strong>—a clearly defined goal—and 3-5 <strong class="bold">key results</strong> that are specific measures used to track the achievement of that goal. The goal of OKRs is to define how to achieve objectives through concrete, specific, and measurable actions. Key results can be measured on a scale of 0-100%. Objectives should also be supported by initiatives, which are the plans and activities that help to achieve the objective and move forward the key results. OKRs can be shared across the organization, with the intention of providing teams with the visibility of goals and to align and focus effort. OKRs are typically set at the strategic, team, and personal levels.</p>&#13;
			<p>A nice way to start OKRs is to link it to the Impact Mapping practice introduced in <em class="italics">Chapter 8, Discovering the Why and Who. </em>The goal statement in the Impact Map translates to an <strong class="bold">Objective</strong> (<strong class="bold">O</strong>). The measurable impact statement connected to the goal translates to <strong class="bold">Key Results</strong> (<strong class="bold">KR</strong>). So, the Impact Mapping practice being used in the Discovery Loop of Strategy and Leadership helps <a id="_idIndexMarker3407"/><a id="_idIndexMarker3408"/>set the intent for products, which can each have their own Impact Maps and OKRs. A Platform Team can also use the Impact Mapping practice to capture and radiate their <em class="italics">Why</em> and build OKRs to support the application products and strategy above.</p>&#13;

			<p class="figure">Figure 18.11: Mobius Loops connected by OKRs and information, metrics, and learning</p>&#13;
			<p>The double loop learning applied throughout this book using Mobius to evolve products applies to platforms and leadership strategies. They are all connected through OKRs, which flow down the organization and change based on information, metrics, and learning flowing up from the platform and products.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-474">Co<a id="_idTextAnchor756"/><a id="_idTextAnchor757"/>nclusion</h2>&#13;
			<p>In this chapter, we explored how we <em class="italics">Sustain It</em>—how we sustain everything we've covered in this book and potentially even grow it!</p>&#13;
			<p>A lot of this comes down to infectious enthusiasm—infectious enthusiasm for the technology and platform, for the way of working and the practices, and for the team and culture. We looked at different ways that infectious enthusiasm is generated and some stories on how the <em class="italics">one team, one dream</em> mantra evolved to multiple Application Product Teams and, eventually, the need for a Platform Team.</p>&#13;
			<p>Whether teams in your organization are the first, second, tenth, or hundredth Application Product, Platform, or Leadership Team, treating the subject being delivered as a product is the success factor.</p>&#13;
			<p>Let's leave you with our top 10 tips for transformation towards DevOps Culture and Practice with OpenShift:</p>&#13;
			<ol>&#13;
				<li value="1">Never forget the foundation—building a foundation of culture and technology practices enables business agility.</li>&#13;
				<li>Never stop improving—whether it is the foundation, the technology, or the products.</li>&#13;
				<li>Never stop learning—the entire system of work is focused on being able to learn at every level. Whether it be a product, a team, a platform, or an organization's strategy, continuous learning should be central to everything.</li>&#13;
				<li>Never done. We call this <strong class="bold">#neverdone</strong> because we are working in infinite loops—double loops of learning that are continuous and never end, right up until product, platform, or organizational shutdown.</li>&#13;
				<li>Show, not tell. This is one that might seem over-said, but one of the true measures is working software. We need it to get feedback and to go around the loops again.</li>&#13;
				<li>Culture is key. Culture can be hard to define, but it's the sense of camaraderie that a team has. It's the in-jokes, the banter that leads to pulling together when things are tough. Or being willing to do that rubbish task this sprint because you know in the next one, someone else will take their turn.</li>&#13;
				<li>Invest in your people. A culture is hard to build but easy to break. Demotivation can creep in and erode trust.</li>&#13;
				<li>Listen to the engineers; they also need to listen to and understand the needs of the business and users, however.</li>&#13;
				<li>Learn by doing—experiment, experiment, experiment. Fail safely, fail fast, and, most importantly, learn from it. Learn by doing.</li>&#13;
				<li>Have fun!</li>&#13;
