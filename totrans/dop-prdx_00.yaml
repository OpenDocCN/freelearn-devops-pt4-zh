- en: I love sharing with others. That's my main motivation when I write a book. There's
    a hard-to-explain joy in knowing that our work as authors might be helping others.
    But strangely, that's not the case with *DevOps Paradox*.

- en: This time, my motivation was much more self-serving. I wrote this book because
    I personally wanted to understand what DevOps is. Now if you know anything about
    me, or have read any of my multi-book *DevOps Toolkit* series (https://www.devopstoolkitseries.com),
    then you're surely thinking that I should already know what DevOps is, especially
    if I'm trying to spread my knowledge of it through these books.

- en: The thing is, if there's anything that my years of working in the field have
    taught me, it's that DevOps is not a well-defined process. There is no set of
    rules that must be followed. As I discovered in my journey, and as you'll read
    in these pages, it's even questionable whether there is such a thing as a "DevOps
    department" or a "DevOps engineer." This ambiguity is exactly why DevOps is so
    fascinating to me, and I hope to you, the reader, as well.

    to talks. Instead, I tend to roam the corridors of conference centers and convention
    halls looking for the next victim who will allow me to pick his or her brain.
    The best thing about conferences is networking. The most interesting conversations
    are not taking place at scheduled talks, but rather in corridors and at the after-parties.

    time attending conferences since I know that I benefit greatly from those "corridor-talks."
    I wanted to do something similar with this book.

    engineer" is the most sought-after role in job listings. That's not to mention
    the fact that "DevOps departments" are popping up like mushrooms after the rain.

    answer to the fundamental question of "What is DevOps?"

- en: DevOps brings sanity into a very chaotic world created by a misunderstanding
    that software development is similar to factory production. DevOps continues where
    Agile left off, and urges us to remove the obstacles that we were often not even
    aware existed.

- en: The idea of DevOps builds empathy between team members that ultimately results
    in greater cooperation. It's about culture, but it's also about the processes
    and the tools. At least, that's what I originally thought, even though I received
    very opposing definitions from the teams I worked with.

- en: To answer the questions I had about DevOps, I asked a number of DevOps practitioners
    what they thought DevOps was. Some of them are industry veterans, while others
    are up-and-coming stars. Some are my friends, while others are people I have admired
    from afar.

    took place in pubs or in conference corridors. Whenever I could, I did my best
    to speak with someone face-to-face.

- en: I wanted the interviews to be casual. I did not want people to answer predefined
    questions. Instead, my goal was to bring to a wider audience the types of conversations
    I normally have with experts I meet in conferences and in companies I work with
    as a consultant. I do believe that some of the best breakthroughs come from corridor-talks.
    That's the spirit I wanted to maintain in the interviews.

- en: Each conversation starts with the question "What is DevOps?" or some variation
    thereof. It is only meant to be a conversation-starter and to facilitate something
    that is an unstructured, unprepared, and very casual conversation. Think of each
    interview as a conversation with a friend or an acquaintance that I've met in
    a pub. As a matter of fact, a few of them were actually recorded in a bar over
    a few beers!
  prefs: []

- en: In this book, I wanted to share casual conversations with people who practice
    and often shape DevOps. My hope is that we'll get insights into what drives those
    people and come away with a better understanding of what makes DevOps so powerful.

- en: The only thing the people I interviewed have in common is an interest in DevOps
    itself. You'll see, however, that some of them have very opposing views of what
    DevOps actually is (or is not), and even whether it's a worthwhile pursuit. You
    may often feel that what is described by one person contradicts what others have
    said. This is intentional and, in my opinion, reflects the chaos DevOps is trying
    to tame. It also serves as a reminder that we are still in the very early stages
    of adopting DevOps to our workplace cultures, while trying to navigate the complexities
    of the software industry and finding different solutions to the same problems.

- en: With all that said, I urge you, the reader, to be open-minded. You've almost
    certainly heard about DevOps, and many of you are likely implementing some form
    of DevOps in your organizations right now. I just ask that you leave what you
    know aside. The interviews in this book are likely to turn everything that you
    think you know upside-down. They will definitely challenge your assumptions and
    your experience. What this book won't do, however, is tell you on which side of
    the DevOps debate to pitch your tent. There is no right or wrong answer here.
    This book also won't tell you how to "do" DevOps, though you may glean some ideas
    for implementation from the experiences related in these interviews. My goal with
    this book is solely to present both sides of the DevOps paradox and leave the
    door open for you to make up your own mind.

- en: How ironic that something designed to break down silos within organizations
    and foster cross-departmental collaboration is the subject of so much debate within
    the IT community! But that's the crux of the DevOps paradox, isn't it? And that's
    why it's such a fascinating topic of conversation. You may not agree with everything
    you read in these interviews, but at the very least they should provoke thought
    and maybe even debate within your organizations as you and your teams embark upon
    your own DevOps journeys.
