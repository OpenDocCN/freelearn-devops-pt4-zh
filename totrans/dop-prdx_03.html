			<p class="intro"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>In 2011, Jeff Sussna founded Sussna Associates, a company specializing in corporate workshops, coaching, and strategic design that enables clients to integrate DevOps. The author of <em class="italics">Designing Delivery: Rethinking IT in the Digital Service Economy</em>, Jeff has more than 30 years of IT experience, from software development to IT integration. You can follow him on Twitter at <code class="inline">@jeffsussna</code>.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Hi, Jeff. Before we start talking about DevOps, could you introduce yourself?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: I'm an independent consultant focused on Agile, DevOps, and coaching design thinking. Through my company, Sussna Associates, I've been in the IT industry for 30 years and during that time, I've built systems and led organizations across the entire development QA (quality assurance) and operation spectrum.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">I was introduced to design thinking and, in particular, service design and cloud computing in 2008, which was somewhat of an epiphany for me because I realized that in the 21st century, service is really at the core of cloud computing and IT. Whether it's infrastructure as a service or software as a service or microservices, you're talking about service that needs to be user-centered at every level of the organization.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">I've really built that into the heart of my consulting practice, helping IT teams, whether they're enterprises or start-ups, to get them to really think in terms of whether it's their users, customers, database team, network team, application team, or whatever you may have. Because of that, I was responsible for introducing the idea of empathy into DevOps.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">In my opinion, at the heart of what I'm doing is learning about how development and operations can think in terms of each other's needs. I brought all of those ideas together in a book I wrote called <em class="italics">Designing Delivery: Rethinking IT in the Digital Service Economy</em>.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">What is DevOps?</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: In your view, what's the meaning of the word "DevOps"? It's as if nobody has a clear idea of what it is, or at least everybody's idea is different. Some say it's about new tools, some claim it's a change in culture, while others associate it with a DevOps engineer role. Some even say the word DevOps doesn't exist. It goes on and on like that as if DevOps is a conspiracy meant to confuse everyone.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: For me, the meaning of "DevOps" is right there in the word itself. We have to start thinking about development and operations as part of one larger unified entity. The guiding principle I used to come to that conclusion again returns to this idea of service. The way we deliver service is digitally, and the thing about service is that the <em class="italics">way</em> you make it is part of <em class="italics">what</em> you make.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">If you look at some of the public relations nightmares that have occurred in the airline industry over the last couple of years, flights are being canceled because reservation systems are going down. There was one incident recently when an airline couldn't check people in because their computer systems went down, and they were trying to use their cell phones to check people in.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I think that everyone takes software for granted these days. We are impatient and expect things to happen immediately, and if things fail, users just move somewhere else. There's no loyalty anymore.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">What many have not yet realized is that it's not only about the features a piece of software offers, but also the stability of its systems. Would you agree with that?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: More and more, what's happening is that the user experience of the customer is very powerfully impacted by operation successes and failures, as much as by features and functionality. The example I like to use is that we imagine there's a new restaurant in town. You try it on a Saturday night, and when you come to work on Monday morning people ask you how it was, and you say, "Well, the food was great, but the service was awful." People are a lot less likely to try the restaurant because they think of the food and the service as part of one overall experience. In my opinion, DevOps reflects the idea that we have to think about functionality and operability together.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">It doesn't matter how wonderful your design or how well coded your website is, if it's very, very slow or if people are constantly getting 500 errors, their level of satisfaction will drop.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">You have to think about system architecture and application architecture. You have to think about how deployment happens, and you have to think about security all as part of one equation. In my mind, DevOps is a portmanteau, which means that we took two words and smashed them together, and the reason we smashed them together is that we started to understand that they're really part of one thing.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Like one big theme instead of departments?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: Yes, and one thing that's important to me is the idea that smashing DevOps together doesn't necessarily mean that everybody must work for the same manager or VP. Everybody has to think about their work as part of something larger. You have to think about your code in terms of, "how will this code get deployed, how secure will this code be, how efficient will this code be, and how well will this code scale?"</p>
			<p class="normal indent">That doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be the person who deploys it into production or answers the pager, whatever the case may be. I work with a lot of enterprises that have this notion of segregation of duties, and the idea that developers aren't allowed to push code into production doesn't mean that they can't do DevOps. If you're a large organization, whether it's a multinational insurance company or Netflix, with a lot of layers and a lot of pieces of technology, then maybe there are a lot of microservices. If not, there's still a lot of applications. The idea that you can have them all as part of one big department with one big giant foosball table and one big giant open office space doesn't really make any sense.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">You have to think about DevOps in terms of collaboration among groups that don't necessarily report to the same person, don't necessarily sit next to each other in the office, or don't necessarily even work in the same city, and there's no problem with that. The problem comes when each group thinks, "Well, this is my job, and I worry about my job, and anybody else who wants something from me has to get in line, and I'm just going to think about my part of the puzzle."</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p>DevOps in the team environment</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I often see the same thing happening, with people saying, "This is my job, but <em class="italics">that's</em> not my job." With that being said, how do you prevent this type of thinking if different managers are giving different teams different objectives, especially ones that are not necessarily in line with the global vision because everybody thinks only, as you said, of their part of the puzzle?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: The way that I coach teams to do it is by getting them to think of each other as the customers, in the same way that the company thinks about people who pay the money to their customers. The network team has customers, and it's really funny because in DevOps, we engage in this little bit of magical thinking where we're all thinking, "Well, one key component of DevOps is the cloud." The cloud solves a bunch of problems, and I agree with that, but if you think about an AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, it's the ultimate silo. There is no bigger silo than the one between your organization and AWS.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">AWS won't even tell you where the data center is, let alone who works on your code, your systems, or whatever the case may be. The thing about these organizations is that they understand they're in the service business and their job is to help you succeed, and they're continually innovating in order to help you succeed. I think exactly the same model applies inside the organization; whether it's split, whether you have two pizza teams that are cross-functional, or if you have departmental breakouts – it doesn't really matter. The question has to change from how do we <em class="italics">run</em> the network to how do we help people <em class="italics">use</em> the network, and that's a very, very subtle but very important and really significant mind shift.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">If you're thinking in terms of how do we run the network and somebody wants an IP address, a DNS entry, or a firewall change, they'll have to get in line behind your process. But if you put them at the center, and you say, "Okay, our job is to make sure that these applications can successfully run and scale on top of our network," then things such as IP addresses, DNS entries, and firewall changes become the core of your job. So, through that, your job becomes primarily one of thinking about who are the people who need to use our services and answering the traditional question of, "Well, how do we make sure the router doesn't fall over?" It doesn't go away, but it becomes an implementation detail as opposed to being the core of your job.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: That makes perfect sense. Everyone's work becomes user-centric, no matter whether those users are external or internal. Meanwhile, everyone's job is to help someone, even when that someone is a colleague from a different department.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Empathy in DevOps</h2>
			<p class="normal indent end">You've both written and spoken a lot about empathy. I'm not sure whether you coined the term EmpathyOps, but can you elaborate on what you mean by empathy?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: There's a lot of confusion and anxiety about its meaning, and a lot of people tend to misunderstand it. Sometimes people think empathy means wallowing in someone else's pain. In fact, there's actually a philosopher from Yale University who is now putting out the idea that empathy is actually bad, and that it's the cause of all of the world's problems and what we need instead is compassion.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">From my perspective, that represents a misunderstanding of both empathy and compassion, but my favorite is when people say things like, "Sociopaths are really good at empathizing". My answer to that is, if you have a sociopath in your organization, you have a much bigger problem, and DevOps isn't going to solve it. At that point, you have an HR problem. What you need to distinguish between is emotional empathy and cognitive empathy, and I use cognitive empathy in the context of DevOps in a very simple way, which is the ability to think about things as if from another's perspective.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">If you're a developer and you think, "What is the experience of deploying and running my application going to be?" you're thinking about it from the perspective of the operations person. If you're an operations person and you're thinking in terms of, "What is the experience going to be when you need to spin up a test server in a matter of hours in order to test a hotfix because all of your testing swim lanes are full of other things, and what does that mean for my process of provisioning servers?," then you're thinking about things from the tester's point of view. And so, to me, that's empathy, and that's empathizing, which is really at the heart of customer service. It's at the heart of design thinking, and it's at the heart of product development. What is it that our customers are trying to accomplish, what help do they need from us, and how can we help them?</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: So, everyone has a customer, and we all need to start thinking about whether our work makes our customer's life easier or better, no matter whether that customer is internal or external. We shouldn't hide behind artificial objectives anymore.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: I'll give you an example of that. I actually got a little grief about this recently because I tend to be a bit of an AWS fanboy, but the reason for that is that I think they understand the idea of user-centered innovation better than anybody else.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">A number of years ago, I was helping a client port an application from a colocation center to Amazon. It was a fairly simple app, and it was primarily a forklift port. It was running on old hardware that was starting to fail, and they didn't want to manage their hardware anymore. So we said, "Okay, let's just put it to Amazon." In this case, we were not going to try and do anything fancy like re-architect the application or anything like that, but we should take advantage of some of the more basic Amazon capabilities, like being able to run the web server auto-scaled across multiple availability zones.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">It's a pretty straightforward thing to do, and there's no reason not to do it. We then came to one piece of our architecture, which was a Memcached server, and we couldn't figure out how to cluster it. It turned out that in those days, it was fairly hard to do. There was a product available that was very expensive, and we weren't sure if it really worked. So, we went around for a while, before we finally decided, let's not worry about it; it's a cache, and if the cache falls over, the application is smart enough to fall back and go straight to the database. Yes, it'll be slow, but it'll survive until we have a chance to tip the cache back up. Let's not sweat it, let's just go on with our work and finish.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">We finished, and I think it was something like a few weeks later when AWS announced a new service called ElastiCache, which was – guess what? – a clustered Memcached server that ran across data centers. All you had to do was push a couple of buttons and type a few things into the console, and you could spin it up as a service. I remember thinking that it was as if they had been reading our emails.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">The point of the story is that Amazon wasn't just resting on their laurels and saying, "We do infrastructure as a service, and we do storage and VMs and networking." They were looking at what it was that their customers were struggling with and how they could help make it easier. I think that is the essence of what we're talking about with DevOps: how do I, as a developer, make operations' lives easier and better, and as an operations person, how do I make development's life easier and better?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: But then what prevents companies from applying this type of thinking? Is it that they don't want to take this approach, that they don't see value in this line of thinking, or is it something else?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: I was talking with a client just the other day about this blockage in their process, to do with deploying code to a test environment. I started the conversation by asking, "Why can't developers deploy their own code? It's not production. There is no segregation of duty issues." They just hadn't thought about it. We talked it through, and they said there were no underlying reasons they couldn't. We would need to make some technical changes but there were no rules that say they shouldn't. It's a simple example of making available that which would make developers' lives easier. I think that expands out from there.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">It has to do with the relationship between development and design, product and development, development and operations, and security and development. We all need to think from the perspective of, "How do we help each other better accomplish what we're trying to accomplish?" Empathy is what enables you to do this. But empathy is also thinking in terms of, "Forget about what I'm doing, what is it that you're trying to accomplish and how could I use my expertise to help you accomplish it?"</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">The big DevOps guy versus the little DevOps guy</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: When you visit companies, do you see any recurring themes, or any commonalities between them? Are they facing the same problems, apart from the obvious of one company is smaller and the other one is bigger?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: I'm surprised at how common they are, regardless of the size of the company. For example, pretty much every single client that I've had, regardless of size, has compliance issues.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Maybe they're a start-up, but they're a healthcare start-up, which means they have to deal with HIPAA (The Health Insurance and Accountability Act of 1996); or maybe they process credit cards, which means they have to deal with PCI (Payment Card Industry); or they provide services to the Federal Government, which means they have to comply with FedRAMP, which is as draconian as any of the other compliance rule sets as you can find. Issues about audits, and segregation duties and access control; all of those things are common across my clients, regardless of their size.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer012">
					<p class="qt">"Pretty much every single client that I've had, regardless of size, has compliance issues."</p>
					<p class="qtSrc">—Jeff Sussna</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent">I see the challenges between development and operations as being surprisingly universal. I think the main difference is that in the big companies, the dysfunction tends to be structural, as in, "I don't like your organization because we have different VPs and the VPs are competing for power," or something like that. Or maybe they're not competing for power, but they're just sort of separate and they're in competition with each other in some fashion.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">There are institutionalized boundaries that keep people apart. In smaller companies, it tends to be much more personal. For instance, "I don't trust you because two and a half years ago, you broke things in a major way and so I don't ever want you deploying to production ever again," but these sorts of struggles to trust and to understand are surprisingly universal.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">It's funny because in both Agile and DevOps, we talk a lot about feedback loops and how we can learn faster. If you look at the three ways of DevOps, you have flow, feedback, and continuous learning. It's surprising how difficult feedback is.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I think that people tend to adopt practices, but where they fail is in understanding the goals behind those practices. As a result, we implement practices but fail to connect with them and gain any real benefits. Almost everyone collects feedback these days. The real question is, how many use that feedback to learn and adapt?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: I did a workshop with a client, a whole section of which was dedicated to feedback loops. The client was a very mature Agile and DevOps organization, and at one point I gave them an exercise, which was to take some linear processes they had and reimagine them as circular, feedback-driven processes in order to see what was different. They all chuckled and nodded wisely at me. Someone raised their hand and said, "We don't really have any linear processes anymore; we've made them all circular," and I said, "Alright, well, indulge me – just try and see what happens, this may be a very fast and easy exercise."</p>
			<p class="normal indent">I'd split the group into four teams, and three of the four teams independently came to the same conclusion, which they reported to me very sheepishly after the exercise. They all came to the conclusion that they were very, very good at collecting feedback but they didn't actually do anything with it. They realized they were wasting an incredible amount of time and energy because they had this whole feedback loop mechanism that they never really closed all the way. If there's a danger that I see both with Agile and DevOps, it's that we get really focused on how fast we can get stuff to production, and we see it as essentially a push problem. One of the misconceptions I see about DevOps is that DevOps is about deployment automation.</p>

					<p class="qt">"If there's a danger that I see both with Agile and DevOps, it's that we get really focused on how fast we can get stuff to production, and we see it as essentially a push problem. One of the misconceptions I see about DevOps is that DevOps is about deployment automation."</p>
					<p class="qtSrc">—Jeff Sussna</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent end">The problem with that is it's one-way, and you don't actually learn. If you push stuff to production and then all you do is go and pick the next thing out of your backlog, how are you really going to know that that's the right next thing to take out of your backlog unless you pay attention to what's happened to the thing you've just deployed? I would say the struggle to really get beyond this sort of an industrial-age approach, of the kind of pushing products out the factory door, is a universal challenge.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Isn't that an example of blindly following processes without understanding the reasoning behind them? The idea behind short sprints is not to be able to do more work but to get that feedback sooner and better decide what to do next. If we just pick up a new item from the backlog, we are missing the point.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">With that being said, let's change the subject. When you work with teams or companies, what is the approach? Are we starting from the top, from the bottom, or in the middle?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: I start all over the place; it really depends on the client. I mean, generally, it's anywhere from the CIO to some director of operations or director of development. It very much depends. It's an interesting question because what I find is that at some point, the two have to come together.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">There's this interesting question about whether DevOps requires an executive buy-in or whether it should be a grassroots thing. In my experience, it doesn't matter where it starts, but at some point, it needs both.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">I've seen places where, particularly with Agile, a CIO comes back from a conference and says, "We're doing Agile now," which is great; the process of actually going from that to an organization that implements it really doesn't require a lot of on-the-ground activity. Some of it is very grassroots: propagation of new behaviors and activities. One of the places that I focus on more and more is what the adoption process looks like, and in my opinion, in my experience – and I think this is another place where organizations struggle – changing how the organization behaves is no different from changing how your website works, or changing how your continuous integration pipeline works.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">It's something that has to happen over time, and it has to happen in an Agile way. What I mean by that is that there has to be learning based on feedback; you can't just drop a plan in and do it, because what happens is people interact with that plan, they struggle, they resist, they learn, they make mistakes, and you find out that your plan maybe needs a little adjustment based on your corporate culture, so it's something that really has to unfold.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Changing the culture around DevOps</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: When you try to change the culture, do you have a plan? I remember someone told me that you could not really predict a complex system; the only thing you can do is poke it and see what comes out.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: You're correct in thinking that you can have techniques that you use to introduce people to your system, and then you have to relate to what happens when they interact with those techniques. Everybody is a little bit different.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">I teach, and when I do a coaching engagement, I always start with, depending on the size of the organization, anywhere from a week to a month spending a lot of time doing an embedded observation to really understand who and where they are. From there, I start introducing new techniques; whether it be stand-ups, continuous integration, or automated server provisioning, it really doesn't matter.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Then the fun starts when we're introducing Kanban. We're thinking, "That's straightforward – we simply show people how it works and explain the principal tool." But what actually happens is that when people start to work with it, they struggle in ways that are very unique to who they are, what their personalities are, and what their corporate culture is. And that's where the real work starts, trying to actually relate to those. I don't think you can really predict that. That's something that's very emergent.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Right, we cannot blindly adopt anything since each of us is very different, as is the culture of each company, and our projects. To think that we can have such a vast difference and yet hope that a single solution will solve everyone's problems is childish, in my view. We all need to gain experience, understand ourselves, and use that knowledge to discover what works best for us.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I'm curious about design thinking, which is something you've mentioned a few times now. Can you elaborate on that?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: Design thinking is quite simply the notion that you can take something about the way designers solve problems, whether it be graphics, industrial, or user interface designers, and you can extract that into a methodology that you can then apply to other problems. For example, how would you introduce DevOps to a new company?</p>
			<p class="normal indent">At the heart of design thinking is the notion of user-centered design, which is based around empathy, but it has particular techniques for helping you empathize, which are all based on observing and interacting with your customers.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">One of the things that I tell teams even deep within IT is that if you're going to redesign something – for instance, you're the database team and you want to redesign the process that application teams use to get new database instances – start by just observing how they do it, and actually go and sit with them and just watch; and then from that you come up with a solution, prototype that solution, and get feedback on it.</p>

					<p class="qt">"Current Agile and DevOps practices are incomplete because we don't really have a mechanism to incorporate true feedback from the people we're trying to serve."</p>
					<p class="qtSrc">—Jeff Sussna</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent">Too many times IT does this thing where we sort of figure out what the right solution should be, we build it, and then we send out these emails saying that we're going to roll it out over the next three months with training. What we've failed to do is take the time to understand how well our solution actually works for the people who are going to be using it.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">The idea of design thinking starts with empathetic observation. It can get more or less formal in terms of how it actually does that, and from there uses a very iterative process of prototyping, user testing, redesigning, and re-implementing to, almost in an Agile way, find its way to a solution.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Part of why I talk about design thinking so much is that I think current Agile and DevOps practices are incomplete because we don't really have a mechanism to incorporate true feedback from the people we're trying to serve. But validating our ideas, beliefs, solutions, and strategies with them is the reason why I think it's important to incorporate design thinking into what we're doing.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: How about Agile and DevOps, then? Are they separate things that you adopt, do they extend across each other, or are they different names for the same thing? Because from what you've said, there are things that sound similar about the two.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Agile versus DevOps</h2>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: DevOps completes the Agile equation. Agile talks a lot about delivering value and working code, but the problem is that by itself, it doesn't actually deliver anything. Instead, Agile kind of stops when you have code that's been written and tested, which nobody can use, so it doesn't do anybody any good.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">The reason for that is Agile grew up in the product age when you would take your code, put it on a CD, and send it to your customer, who were the ones responsible for actually deploying and operating it. Those days are pretty much gone now, so that development and operations elements are really part of the same equation. Agile can't actually deliver the value unless that code can be deployed, and that deployment environment can be operated, and the problems can be fixed, including where new code can be deployed, and so on.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">I don't think development without operations is meaningful anymore; and again, to clarify, when I say "operations," I mean in the largest sense of overall operability, so that includes not just running servers or running infrastructure, but also security, which is an integral part of that.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">If your code or your infrastructure isn't secure, that's probably worse than if they don't scale. If your code doesn't scale, your website is slow, or your data entry application is slow, and that's annoying.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Being slow is definitely better than not being available at all due to a security exploit that someone has used to bring your whole cluster down. If my data gets stolen from your system, not only will I not be your customer anymore, but I am likely to sue you as well. The part that confuses me is the talk about DevSecOps, because I come away feeling, like, why are we even talking about security? Isn't security something that is mandatory anyway and therefore part of DevOps? Or, did it somehow become optional and now we need to talk about including it as a separate practice?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: If my personal health data, credit card, or social security number gets stolen, then that's a lot more than just annoying. I know that when people talk about DevSecOps, they talk about rugged DevOps, which is the idea of DevOps with security built in. But the thing is, would you ever want to propose doing non-rugged DevOps? I certainly wouldn't.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">I certainly wouldn't want to go to my CIO and say that we don't want to do rugged DevOps, we're just going to do unrugged DevOps, and that we're not going to worry about security. I wouldn't think that would go down very well. But, going from there, I think I would say that if we were trying to be Agile, at this point, you can't really be Agile without extending that into your operational approach to things.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I think it's more and more questionable how meaningful Agile and DevOps are without each other. I look forward to the day when we have a better word that just encompasses the whole thing, and we don't even worry anymore about whether there's a division. I mean, if you think about it, the dividing line between Agile and DevOps is still this strange space between development and operations, which is what we're trying to get rid of with DevOps. You could say that if you take DevOps seriously, you can't really believe in a fundamental separation between Agile and DevOps.</p>

			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: In your experience, are there expertise groups that are more or less willing to adopt this line of thinking, or is that a universal problem for everybody?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: I think that more and more people are comfortable with the idea of joining Agile and DevOps together from the perspective of how fast we can get something from the product manager's brain into production. I think the backside of the feedback loop is a lot harder, and I think most people are still struggling with that, and that's a sin. As I've said before, I think both Agile and DevOps discussions often share the same sin, which is we think it's one-directional.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I'll give <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>you an example: I worked with an organization where I was told by the head of development that they did sprint demos to show people what they were going to deploy before they deployed it. The point of a sprint demo is information; it's gathering feedback, it's making sure you're about to deploy the right thing in the right way before you deploy it. This head of development was approaching the sprint demo in a pure sense: "well, we're done, and we're going to let you see it before we ship it, but don't expect us to make any changes or listen to your feedback." I see that problem all over the place.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: It's almost as if I'm giving you permission to see it but whether you see it or not doesn't matter much to me.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: That's exactly right, and I think part of the benefit of infusing design thinking is that at the very heart of it is the idea that you're going to show it to somebody, and then you're going to make changes based on their response to it.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: If I understand it right, that means that even if we go years back, in many places Agile didn't work, because if it did then that type of thinking would be engraved already, at least, in parts of an organization.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">You mentioned complex systems, and I think that's actually worth talking about a little bit.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">You hit the nail on the head when you said that complex systems are ones that you can't predict. So, in that sense, you can't plan for them; you can only really probe them and interact with them based on what you learned from that probe.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: The systems we are building are complex systems, so even in enterprises where there are very legacy environments, I see more and more that they'll have outages that are caused by interactions between the application, database, network, load balancer, and firewall.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">In order <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/>to understand the outage, you have to understand how all of the components interact with each other, and if any of those had been different, then the outage might have been different, or it might not have happened at all. What digital business and the digital economy and all that the fun stuff is doing is breaking down the boundaries between these different systems.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: When I see things like this whole idea of bimodal IT, to me it doesn't actually connect to reality, because what I see is customer-facing applications that, in order to work properly, have to interact with ERP, or Enterprise Resource Planning, systems, and the lack of agility in the ERP system becomes a blocker to agility in the frontend system.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Nowadays, we have to think about our whole organization and all of our systems together as this one complex system.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: If we can't predict or control complex systems, what do we do? Do we just give up? No, we have to have the ability to continually learn. So, why do we need Agile? Why do we need DevOps? Why do we need design thinking?</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Because when we approach them correctly, they give us the ability to very efficiently, and effectively, continuously learn from each other, from our customers, from our systems, from our incidents, and I think that's ultimately what we are trying to accomplish with all of these new practices.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: In my experience, when I dig a bit deeper, beyond what people tell me, I find somehow that the blame is always the biggest obstacle <a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>because when those things happen, like what you said – for example, an outage – somebody needs to be blamed for that, and that means nobody's going to give me enough information so I can learn from it.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: Even beyond that, the idea of blame assumes that you could isolate causes.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Right, which brings us back to the complex system.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: Exactly.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I think that gives us a nice place to wrap up unless you have anything else to say, Jeff?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Jeff Sussna</strong>: No, I don't, but it's been great talking to you, Viktor. I can't wait to see what everyone else thinks about DevOps.</p>
