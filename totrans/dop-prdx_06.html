			<h2 class="introHdg"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>Introducing Damien Duportal</h2>
			<p class="intro"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"/>According to Damien, being a DevOps engineer is all about the people, culture, and tools. Alongside his work at Træfik, Damien is a training engineer at CloudBees, where he focuses on the CloudBees Jenkins Platform and Jenkins OSS. You can follow him on Twitter at <code class="inline">@DamienDuportal</code>.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I'm going to ask you a question that I want to use as a springboard into our discussion of DevOps. Simply put, what is the Duportal definition of DevOps?</p>
			<p class="thematic" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">The Duportal definition of DevOps</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: Today, DevOps is a trendy buzzword that is used to try to achieve focus on value, and not only for the technical or cost concerns. At its core, DevOps is really about how we should work together in the IT industry. I'm not just talking about the process, but also about the culture, tools, and the people involved in it. This is why I said it's a trendy buzzword because there is no strict definition as you could have for IT service management.</p>

					<p class="qt">"DevOps was focused not on the tools themselves but on the way these tools could achieve either a new way of working or a breaking down of the barriers between teams and departments, which means working and talking to each other, in order to generate cross-team awareness."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Damien Duportal</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent">More recently, DevOps has been taken over by a different sphere of influence, but initially, for me, it was a movement that started around the idea of tooling. <a id="_idTextAnchor013"/>DevOps was focused not on the tools themselves but on the way these tools could achieve either a new way of working or a breaking down of the barriers between teams and departments, which means working and talking to each other, in order to generate cross-team awareness.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I define DevOps as empathy, which I think is the main key here. DevOps is a way of bringing empathy back into our work, and the tools—Docker being the most famous, but by no means the only one—that can help you to do that. But it's important to understand that when I say empathy, I mean empathy with your other colleagues, not just between the two sides of DevOps—development and operations—but also between engineers and salespeople, executives and employees, and all of the local departments of an organization that should focus on the <em class="italics">global</em> optimum and not on their <em class="italics">local</em> optimum. You need to be aware of the issues that your other colleagues could be facing and not just those issues affecting you or your local departments. The tools are just one way of achieving that, which appeals a lot to engineers because engineers love their tools.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: So, DevOps is really using tools to help bring empathy back?</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Can DevOps bring empathy back?</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: Yes! If you have a tool that helps you to share empathy, then you have a great foundation for starting the conversation. Even if this seems boring to engineers, at least they'll start talking and listening to each other. I mean, once they've stopped debating sterile tabs versus spaces or JavaScript versus Java—or whatever sterile debate it is—they'll have to focus on the value they're going to provide. So, this is really how I would sum up DevOps, which again is about how you bring empathy back and focus on the value creation and interaction side of IT.</p>

					<p class="qt">"I would sum up DevOps as how you bring empathy back and focus on the value creation and interaction side of IT."</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: But why is that particularly important?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: Because of the different human behaviors. But more than that, empathy is one of the most advanced bricks you can have for building human interaction. If we are able to achieve so many different things—with different people, different opinions, and different cultures—it's because we, as humans, are capable of having high levels of empathy. As soon as you have empathy, you can understand why you provide value. If you don't, then what's the point of trying to create value? It will only be from your point of view, and there are over seven billion other people in the world. So, ultimately, we need empathy to understand what we are going to do with our tools.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: That's a good one. You mentioned that Docker is one of those tools; could you expand on that?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: Before I went freelance, I worked as a developer, but because there were only a few of us, I was quite close to those working in operations. Despite taking Java development courses as an engineering graduate, I was always interested in how we could start coding the infrastructure from very early on. I can't remember who said this, but I believe it was someone at Netflix—<em class="italics">If you build it, you run it</em>. I love that mindset and it's what brought me to provisioning tools such as Docker, SaltStack, Chef, Puppet, and Ansible.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Overcoming the fear of change</h2>
			<p class="normal indent end">We used a lot of these tools to help to bring operations teams' concerns to developers. Bear in mind that a lot of developers didn't want to learn these tools, and what I quickly discovered was that this was because of fear. Developers were driven by fear because they didn't understand these new tools and, because they lacked a lot of knowledge, they were closed off. They were terrified by the idea of operations knowledge and failed to actually see that these tools presented a lot of new things for them to learn and try. But what the developers didn't realize was that that fear was also present in the operations people on our teams, and that was just locally.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: That fear of change is a really great perspective, but did you ever manage to remove that fear from both the development and operations teams?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: I should add that I can't generalize to other contexts, but that's how I understood things and behaviors from our end. In response to your question, it took me three to four years of trying to build a bridge between both parties and convincing them not to be scared. That bridge was me saying that we can work together and choose pair programming, even something as simple as sharing a beer after work or a coffee before, or doing sports together outside of work. Was it successful? Well, it was helping, but not completely solving the problem because at the time I lacked the ability to bring empathy to the team.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">When Docker landed, it was as if I had seen the light at the end of the tunnel because, finally, I had a development tool produced by a person who shared the same concerns of those in operations at the heart of the development. That's really the reason why I used it. The good thing is that whenever a person started with Docker, they had the same learning curve. Why was this important? Because it made it visible for everyone that we all had a lot to learn.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Docker managed to be the bridge because it successfully broke down the barrier of fear because operations not only saw what they had to learn, but it turned out that they really liked learning the new tools. The only thing missing now was the time to learn. But the time issue was also seen as a potential investment opportunity, with those in operations thinking that if they spend time learning Docker, then gradually, the developers would follow us or our recommendation. At the same time, on the other side of the bridge, the developers were starting to think along the lines of: "Hey! That tool Docker sounds good! It could help us. It's easy to use, and it works very fast." Docker was just a way to turn a lot of this scary-sounding technology into a fancy tool. So, with that thinking, even marketing got on board and helped spread awareness of it everywhere.</p>

					<p class="qt">—Damien Duportal</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: But apart from building a bridge between the two teams, how was Docker able to create a feeling of empathy between them?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: What Docker did was make the learning curve linear. You were able to start with just a few lines of code and get something done very easily. Through this, you could then see that if the coding worked, then it's already gained value. The teams were able to choose the moment when they would learn and add more quality or more completeness to what they wanted to achieve with Docker. This method was quite linear when compared to whatever tools you could have used before for finding the gaps. But back then, you had to learn Linux and Linux configuration, and possibly even Unity or systemd—all of the distributions—which were all learned in big steps. This was how I discovered and was subsequently convinced, in a very short time, that these tools brought empathy.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">It reminds me of situations we, as an industry, have been completely locked on for years, such as an operations person coming to the development team and saying: "Hey! Nice application. Do you know where the application is expected to write files on the filesystem?" Because, by saying that, it implied the intention was because we have an issue in production right now, a performance and/or security issue or an audit, and we needed that information because it's valuable. But in that case, the communication was just: "We need this, and it's mandatory." But all the developers heard was: "Oh, yeah. We want information that's really boring, and we don't want to search by ourselves."</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: So, did Docker remove that barrier?</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Docker, containers, and the rate of adoption</h2>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: The message was totally transformed. By using Docker as a support for the base communication, we just removed that barrier. In Docker, you can just say: "OK. Let's use the read-only flag," and by default, everything will be forbidden in writing except when you have an exhaustive list of the data volume. This is technical stuff, but once you've tackled the technical problems, you remove the stress, and then you can start talking. We were in need of Docker because we needed to remove that stress. You just removed the engineering part and focused on the discussion of needs in advance, and that's why Docker was a big game changer here, but it stands on the shoulders of giants.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">In earlier years, this work was being done by the likes of Puppet and Chef, who were already bringing the development mindset back to operations. Operations people are just developers for the system. For example, all kernel developers are developers, and their operations people help. So, <em class="italics">there is no such thing as operations or development because, at the end of the day, we are all doing the same job</em>. It's just that the amount of knowledge required for each area is much more than one person can handle on their own, so we have to partition that knowledge. But still, the daily job is editing text files, planning, and testing that that change locally, and then globally, is the same for everyone. We just have to be reminded of this, and Docker was a great aid for that.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: That's interesting because, if I understand you correctly, what you said is that Docker made it possible to implement DevOps without companies having to plan the change. Basically, Docker made it happen naturally without any enforcement of the idea that you need to talk to this guy. Otherwise, the consequences are going to happen.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: I used to say that Docker was just uncovering the dust that you hide for a year under the carpet, and suddenly, you put Docker somewhere, and you can use it as a maturity indicator. If you put Docker somewhere and everything explodes, then you don't know how to monitor Docker, or even how to build an image. If that's the case, the real question then is what were you doing before Docker? Were you just covering your eyes and throwing code into production without thinking about it?</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer023">
					<p class="qt">"I used to say that Docker was just uncovering the dust that you hide for a year under the carpet, and suddenly, you put Docker somewhere, and you can use it as a maturity indicator."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Damien Duportal</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent end">Generally speaking, the issue was that the knowledge was partitioned across all of the different departments and no one was sharing. Docker is just there to underline that point. It would say: "OK. If you're having issues, it's because you are not able to communicate with each other efficiently. You already have the knowledge, you already have the skills, but you need to bring awareness and empathy," and that was a much better indicator for me.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: So, how big do you think the adoption of containers is these days? Is everybody already using it, or is the full acceptance of it still pending?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: I would say it's still pending.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: What's stopping everybody from adopting it?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: I don't have enough experience to give a definitive answer as I haven't seen that many cases, but what I have seen over at least the last two years is a failure to take the time to embrace the change. In layman's terms, this means DevOps teams are saying: "We're scared of doing that. We are always on edge in terms of timing. Stop focusing on what is our value, what we could bring, and what we should remove on our path, and instead tell us what we should focus on." So, then, you could say that we might use a container, and this could help us. It's an investment; we can spend some time now so that we don't have to spend time later on. That issue is more about being totally on edge, and not being able to stop, focus, and breathe. This can, of course, be caused by a number of things such as a large number of people leaving the company, culture issues, or a big increase in the workload, but they're all things that shouldn't last for any significant amount of time.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">The other thing I saw, mainly with smaller companies, or where they have people that are already efficient in empathy, is that, by sharing and being empathic, they don't see the container as bringing them value. Let's say you have three big metal machines: what's the point of installing Kubernetes or Docker Swarm if you already have a load balancer and a few applications? I would be interested to ask the same question in two years' time because there are things in motion that cannot be stopped. I wouldn't say container is the de facto standard; it's just that things that were in one direction three years ago have totally changed. But I'm not scared by this because that would mean you have the mindset of saying, "should we do that?" Yes, because of blah, blah, blah, or no, because of blah, blah, blah. If that's going to happen, expect to spend the next six months, or even years, evaluating your options based on your current context.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: But the idea is that containers will become the de facto standard, so do we just need more time, or is something else coming down the line?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: One thing that containers don't bring to the table is resource management as we used to have it. I have an example from the CI/CD world with Jenkins, where it has been a challenge to use Docker in the same way over the past few years, and it's still because what you want is to allocate resources when you need them, and deallocate resources when you don't need them anymore.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Back then, containers were thought to be the golden solution, providing you with an immutable environment that you could easily start and stop within a few seconds, and then use the implied infrastructure for running the container, which could bring you these facilities of scaling horizontally or vertically. Right now, we have a cloud solution, and this is how they make money in the cloud by providing a platform on which to run these containers. So, I think this will be the big kick in the backside, in the sense that now that everyone is selling platforms for running containers on all of the big guns in the market, the rest will just follow. It's exactly like where virtual machines were a decade ago.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Out of interest, what system did you grow up with?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: I'm too young to have known the transition to virtual machines. I just know my history. I started with a PowerPC Mac, and everyone told me that I was running a virtual PC, and because of that, I was wasting resources. But two years later, when I started engineering IT boards, everyone was like: "Oh, look; this metal provides a virtual machine, so it's easier as I can change it during a run." History is a repetition. Virtualization concepts have existed for 40 years, so a container is just one way of reusing this concept, and this technology is just improving the usage.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer024">
					<p class="qt">"What's missing in order to have containers as the de facto standard? Just a bit of time for everyone to be convinced that the system is good for them."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Damien Duportal</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent end">What's missing in order to have containers as the de facto standard? Just a bit of time for everyone to be convinced that the system is good for them. But there are also other factors, for example, the recruitment and subsequent hiring crisis, which is resulting in it being difficult to find good engineers. So, that's not the person with the diploma who solves problems in the IT area—say, someone like an IT engineer or software engineer because we already have a lot of them—but it's not enough. What we require is people with different backgrounds, because as the container becomes the de facto standard platform, it will create the required blueprint for everyone to build something, whatever language, culture, or way of working you come from. I think it's more a matter of time than anything else.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Software companies, vendors, and conferences</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: You've mentioned companies. I know that you go to conferences every once in a while, so I'm wondering what do you think about software vendors nowadays? Whenever I go to a conference, I always see every product being labeled as DevOps, and I'm getting a bit confused by that because it's got me thinking, what do they actually mean?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: It's just a way for those vendors to find a business model in a fast-changing sector. There are the debates about the open source or closed source business models. As you said, everyone at conferences today is selling DevOps because everyone understands that selling just a single piece of software is not sustainable. It might have been in the 1980s or 1990s, but not today. As a developer, you need to grow the value of what you are providing, or someone else will build the same software and will just totally roast you in their wake. When I grew up as an engineer, the pace of new development was years, but now it's months.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">You can start with whatever legendary product you want, but in a few months' time, someone else will be able to duplicate it even more successfully, or at least for a cheaper price. So, DevOps is a way of not closing yourself off on the business marketing side.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">It's a loose coupling between the marketing people and engineers because they're not totally sure, so they shove the DevOps between those two. Maintaining the lines of communication between these two departments should bring cross-departmental awareness because the engineers have the ideas, some of which have sales potential while others do not, but they are valuable internal assets, and marketing need to sell things.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I'm not a marketing person, but at the point where you need to market the product to someone that doesn't have the engineering background, you need to have some synchronization between teams. It's much like databases. If you do synchronization or meetings all of the time, you are locked in, and you can't go fast. But if you go too fast, you'll have desynchronization between both the organization and the local optimum that are not the global optimization of the organization. So, by using DevOps in marketing as a tight coupling, you say: "OK, let's put in that blocking keyword, and then we'll see."</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: You've spent a lot of time teaching. It's got me wondering: what challenges do you face when you try to teach people something?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: It's all about the diversity block word. I said "block word" because it can have a lot of meanings based on your intention, but the main barrier here is that we are in desperate need of skilled engineers, and right now, we have a few ways to teach people how to be engineers and problem-solving people. What we need are developers, not those that aren't at that engineer-grade level, but those who are able to build stuff.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">I've lived through the very cool change that saw people coming from web development who then started to work next to Java developers, who used to be the backend of the organization. You had just enough cases where they were fighting each other. Those frontend developers with their just-enough typed language—JavaScript—where you can do whatever you want in JavaScript, and that's catastrophic. Everyone was focusing on that, but there were a lot of situations where people were starting to learn from each other.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer025">
					<p class="qt">"JavaScript went untyped and took the good things from the other world, and this is exactly what we need: more people coming from different backgrounds and different work cultures."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Damien Duportal</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent end">JavaScript went untyped and took the good things from the other world, and this is exactly what we need: more people coming from different backgrounds and different work cultures. Just to be able to say: "OK, well, you used to do things that way, but I would have done it this way." We could learn a lot from each other, because it's not only about the person that knows and the person that doesn't know, it's also about the person who thinks differently; and that can help you to focus again on the value, because our brains are all different, and the bigger barrier in education is teaching to different profiles.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">The education system</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: So then, what's your view of the education system? How do we get it to teach to so many different profiles?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: Some people prefer hands-on practice over reading. For instance, if someone says that they don't understand your slides about the network OSI model, that's actually OK. What you should do then is give them a Raspberry Pi and a keyboard and make them learn by configuring a TCP/IP, and then they'll go back to learn the OSI model. We know it's a requirement to have that foundational knowledge and, for now, it's OK. But do you need it after working in IT or networks for a few years, or do you need it upfront before doing anything else? It depends, and if we say we should teach all people like this, we are already in the wrong.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">The main challenge is finding teachers who are adaptable, and are able to talk to the people in front of them and say: "OK, you don't understand what I'm saying? I need to find something else, or I need to ask for help from someone else, someone in the group maybe." It's not only about being a teacher or a student. It's about sharing knowledge and learning from each other. I think I learn as much as my students do each time, which is fine, and I think we need people that are not scared of that fact.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">You just have to look at what's currently happening where I grew up and where I live—in Western Europe: the educational system creates that fear. You are the teacher; the students must address you as a grown-up adult, which I am not at all and will never be. But that's the case for a lot of people. I feel the best place for people to learn and share knowledge is in a less formal environment, but we have some work to do in order to safeguard that. Only time and experimentation will help to solve this issue. Because again, almost all teachers have the skills and the knowledge. But their ability to share this knowledge is blocked by their fear of not knowing everything, of not always having the right answer, of feeling ashamed to say when they don't know something or that they need help from someone else. Sometimes we just need to figure out a solution together. There's absolutely no shame in that.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Because what you're now describing in education to me sounds very similar to what you described initially with the empathy problems faced in companies.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: Well yes, it does, and that's because, once you are adaptable to unlearning what you've learned, you can start solving problems by saying: "OK, let's take a deep breath and focus on what the problem is that I need to solve." You might try different ways until you solve it, or equally, maybe you don't solve it. But whatever you do, you at least learned something and maybe, along the way, you solved the issue. I mean, that's the natural cognitive pattern for humans, and because of that, we need to have it in both education and work, and not only in the IT sector.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I mean, we know how farmers are doing things. For instance, you cannot be a farmer for 40 years and always have the exact same routine because the climate is constantly changing. You don't know whether you'll have ice next year, whether it will be too sunny, or whether you'll have enough water, and so, you have to adapt; that's the natural way.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Do you ever get requests from people asking you to teach them how to become DevOps engineers?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: No, never. I mean, how should I answer that question? Talk to each other, and say: "Hey, you're almost a DevOps engineer"?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: The only reason I'm asking this is that I don't truly understand what a DevOps engineer is. I see the word everywhere, and in fact, I get DevOps engineer job offers all of the time. But at the heart of it, I still don't understand what it is they would be expecting me to do.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: In my first company, I was a DevOps engineer for one year, and I still don't know what my role was. So, I agree with you in that there is no such thing as a DevOps engineer, or even a DevOps team. The main purpose of DevOps is to focus on value, and by that I mean finding the optimum for the organization and the value it will bring.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer026">
					<p class="qt">"In my first company, I was a DevOps engineer for one year, and I still don't know what my role was. So, I agree with you in that there is no such thing as a DevOps engineer, or even a DevOps team."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Damien Duportal</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent end">So, if you build an organization that only has the support of the organization focusing on the value, then what's the job of the other? What are they doing? You just put the keywords in, but in fact, what you need is someone who has the speaking skills and empathy. So, maybe a good place to start would be with an empathy engineer?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Whenever something new comes along and becomes popular, there is always a hype around it. And then, even before that hype has diminished, there's a new product or a new tool right behind it that's generating even more hype. But right now, I don't know what's next. What's the next big thing? Is there anything coming after DevOps?</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">What's next after DevOps?</h2>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: Not yet, but to be honest, I still haven't gained enough experience in my professional life to be able to make that kind of prediction. I would not have been able to predict Red Hat being bought by someone else. When Sacha Labourey did that, I was like: <em class="italics">that guy is completely crazy</em>, though in fact, he just has way more experience than I have.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Right now, in the technology sector, we have the Internet of Things stuff, and so maybe a security engineer will be the next big thing, because when the smart fridge that everyone owns gets hacked, all of the milk and beers you had in it will be ruined. So, maybe this could be the new trend? It's like the Ghostbusters; it would be the security engineer coming out because your fridge has been hacked.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I mean, when IoT, and I'm not saying even if, but when IoT is all around us, we might see the same pattern. A long time ago, we had people coming to our house to fix our computers, but now we don't do that anymore because we have laptops that we throw away when they don't work. But maybe that will come back, kind of like a person that fixes your house, in a retro way, bringing back the old school stuff of someone fixing your home.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: People that were thrown by force outside the IT world—for example, people building a house—might be able to come back into the hype because you, Viktor, might need someone to break down the wall of your house because no one can unhack your door. So, you'll need someone with a hammer to deconstruct the wall.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Let me out! I cannot go through the door!</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: Ha! I think we're all going to have a lot of fun with the new trend.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">On Amazon, Microsoft, and Google</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: There's one last question before we go, which is based on the way companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are working. Are they eating away the need for skilled people? I mean, we're in 2019, and you don't need to develop your own machine learning now as Google gives it to you. Likewise, you don't need to transcribe as Google does it for you, and that's just two of multiple possible examples. So, what is the relation between the services and what we're doing?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damien Duportal</strong>: For me, it's like drying a river. Those companies need skilled people, and the few that they've currently hired are being paid a lot. But right now, the question is: why are these people skilled? It's because they gained experience and knowledge over the years. But how did they do that? Because the companies that hired them gave them opportunities.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">It's like the COBOL time. At this moment in time, a skilled person—unless they build the new Terminator or supercomputer—will want to focus on something else in their life before they retire. But when they stop, what are we going to do at that moment? Because if we dry the river, we don't have water anymore. I think that's exactly what is happening.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">But since things are changing a lot, I think there will be an ever-growing number of Red Hat-type companies or new companies that will emerge because, on the other hand, we have increased capabilities to build whatever we want. So, a lot of new, differently skilled engineers will emerge and will build alternatives. I really trust human nature to do that.</p>

			<p class="normal indent">But the last thing I'll say is that you always have resistance. We were talking earlier about the transcript for this interview. In my case, I'm willing <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/>to pay you a few bucks to have it done because I don't want to spend my time doing it. But <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>at the same time, I know a bunch of people that would say, "Oh no, I'm going to use AWS! I'm going to buy a Raspberry Pi and do it with no network at all."</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I'm <a id="_idIndexMarker008"/>sure if you go to DevOps functions all across the world, you will find people that will build things themselves, and one of these people will be the next Alphabet executive. The issue is that, right now, they are drying out, but it's short term, and we have enough resilience for solving that problem.</p>
