			<h2 class="introHdg"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Introducing Mike Kail</h2>
			<p class="intro"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Over 25 years, Mike Kail has experience in a wide range of IT fields, including scalability, network architecture, security, software as a service, and cloud deployment. His DevOps area of focus includes empathy, integrity, teamwork, and resilience. You can follow him on Twitter at<code class="inline"> @mdkail</code>.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Hi, Mike. I want to start with what may seem like a really silly question: what is DevOps? Everyone I've spoken to has given me a different answer, with some saying it's a process, others saying that it's a tool, and others that it's being a DevOps engineer. What's your view?</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">What is DevOps?</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: I certainly don't view DevOps as a tool or a job title. In my view, at the core, DevOps is a cultural approach to leveraging automation and orchestration to streamline code development, infrastructure and application deployments, and subsequently, the managing of those resources.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: You've spoken in the past about DevSecOps. Is that the next iteration of DevOps?</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">The next iteration of DevOps</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: As the industry has evolved, there are companies that have transformed into a culture of DevOps. In that situation, the question is, how do we shift left and bring them into the continuous integration and deployment pipeline? We need to inject security testing earlier on in the process from CodeCommit to the building and delivery stages. Security needs to be treated as a continuous loop instead of as a periodic approach to testing and compliance.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Does that mean that by evolving toward including security, the industry is almost falling behind by not including it from the very beginning?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: Unfortunately, for the most part, security has always been a periodic set of tasks or processes. For example, when you did a pen test once a quarter, you might have done static code analysis every now and then, but they're all done manually. You need to think about how you start leveraging automation to make it part of that continuous CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipeline, ensuring you use the best tools to do that.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">You'll also require security engineers to start better understanding the software development process. They don't have to be developers themselves per se, but they need to understand at least what's going on. Developers also need to have some awareness about security, although it's never going to be top of mind or top priority. They have features and other reasons as to why they want to do high-velocity development, but they at least need to understand the security aspect and to start thinking about it as early on as possible.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: In other words, you're baking security into your process and not treating it as an afterthought.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: Exactly! It's similar to the grandparent or parent test that we can implement when we're using Microsoft Word or Google Docs to write a long document. As you're typing, the program will do the spelling and grammar checks for you so you don't run the risk of having your project delayed because of errors that you need to correct when you're about to publish the document.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">The same can be applied to security, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting, which are always in the OWASP Top 10 set of vulnerabilities that keep surfacing over and over again.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Brilliant, I love it. Depending on whom we ask, it's been a couple of years since DevOps really became a thing. This gets me thinking: as an industry, would you say we are at the top of the hard cycle? You've worked with a number of companies, so I would love to know if you see companies as part of the story of whether we're adopting DevOps, or whether it has already been adopted.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer050">
					<p class="qt">"I still think it's early days for the cultural transformation within DevOps."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Mike Kail</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: I still think it's early days for the cultural transformation within DevOps. We've seen the early adopters and leaders show the benefits of DevOps and what it can do to transform your business. But right now, everybody's trying to figure out how they get to that place, and I think that's why we still have a lot of misconceptions about what DevOps really is.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Look at it this way: if I just call my team of engineers DevOps engineers, then I'm doing DevOps. You have to approach the idea from the cultural perspective, and then, from there, leverage one of the core tenets of DevOps—that being measurement—to see where you are and how it's actually helping transform your business. DevOps is not a panacea.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: That's my impression of the situation, because when I visit companies, I always get the sense that in most cases, a random team was renamed "DevOps." What was once the tooling or CI/CD team is now a DevOps team, and when I ask people what they now do differently, quite often they don't know how to answer me.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: A long time ago, I was a Unix system and network administrator. I've seen through my work there that title inflation can take place. If I wanted to make more money, I wouldn't be a system administrator; I'd be a systems architect. Both site reliability engineers and DevOps engineers only exist to justify more pay without the benefits of the cultural transformation.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">A true DevOps culture, with a team of engineers, means that they can articulate what they're doing differently, as well as actually show you because they measure it. They have metrics around the efficiency of how many deployments they are doing today versus what they were doing several months ago. However, what benefits the business from seeing these metrics versus just piling on more deployments won't necessarily equate to whatever is actually driving the business. To achieve that, they have to have that business focus as well.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Does that mean that people who want to be in the DevOps industry need to learn new skills, or do we need people with different abilities?</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">The evolution of DevOps culture</h2>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: I think the evolution of DevOps culture is an ongoing thing. It's not like, all of a sudden, I go from being an operations person to a DevOps person because I did some automation. We have to understand that everybody needs some software development skills, whether it's scripting, pair coding, or implementing proper tooling in the CI/CD chain. But at the end of the day, you have to have an engineer mentality, and I think that's probably what we're saying.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">The technology landscape is always evolving, whether it's through new infrastructure, or a new CO tool coming out to help you manage your fleet better. It understands Kubernetes, Mesos, or the myriad of other container orchestration platforms out there. It's also the wider question of how you make those platforms more efficient by the standard of DevOps cultural components.</p>

					<p class="qt">—Mike Kail</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I recently spoke with a friend on a similar subject, and he described it as the DevOps industry needing to remove the silos between departments. It's not because they're inefficient, but because when people start working together, they begin developing a level of empathy and start feeling each other's pain that in the end leads to better collaboration on different solutions.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: Exactly; otherwise, it's this "us versus them" mentality, which gets DevOps either implicitly or explicitly put into the culture. You're then not working to move the business forward. Instead, you're working on looking better, or having your team be more efficient, and at the end of the day, that doesn't really matter. What matters is your company's metric, whether it's revenue, customer delight, or something else.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">First you break down the silos, flatten the organization, and eliminate the hierarchy, which is disarming for many, and then you figure out if you have the right people from a personality and collaboration perspective versus those with pure engineering skills. Softer skills like empathy matter, as does proper communication, owning your failures, not punishing mistakes, and learning from those mistakes and failures quickly.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: That's a really good point. People often ask why they can't have DevOps where developers, those testing the products, sysadmins, and all the different people from different silos work together. But on the other hand, there's that story about infrastructure being a commodity, and not mattering that much anymore. Is that something you agree with?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: I still think you need to understand the various components of infrastructure and where different CPU, memory, or disk configurations matter.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Infrastructure, cost, and the cloud</h2>
			<p class="normal indent end">You need to think about infrastructure as a set of components. How do you assemble those components and then interact with them? In addition to that, how do you keep everything evolving? Infrastructure is much more elastic—to use a cloud term—than static, as it was before. Applications that live on top of that used to have the monolithic stacks or classic three-tiered architecture, but nowadays with containers, VMs, and microservices-based architectures, that's changed rapidly. It's why everybody needs to understand from an engineering perspective how the application or a set of services behave. It's also why they keep tracking that and looking for anomalies, because that's how you make sure that the site or your service is more reliable.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: What prevents companies from going to the cloud? Many of those that I've communicated with still tend to reject it, or maybe I'm just unlucky with the companies I work with.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: No, it's not just you. I think it's a classic combination of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. People fear insecurity in the public cloud for various reasons, whether it's a fact or a rumor. For example, there's a fear of jobs going away. If I manage the metal in a data center, how do I now do that in the cloud? Is it more self-service? This is the exact reason why you have to keep evolving your skills to be more engineering-centric than just a maintainer of pets.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Other factors are at play here as well: doubt and cost. You get a shock when you receive the monthly bill from your public cloud IS provider because while you may have shifted your application, you failed to do any proper refactoring of it. Your on-premises was overprovisioned—which is also something you didn't factor that cost into—and is now running on expensive, virtual machines in the public cloud. You're wasting a bunch of resources.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer052">
					<p class="qt">"People fear insecurity in the public cloud for various reasons, whether it's a fact or a rumor."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Mike Kail</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent end">You should use that opportunity to move to the public cloud and look at re-architecting how you can make your deployments more efficient, because there's a bunch of other cost levers. Having managed a dozen or so owned-and-operated global data centers, I know there's a lot of costs that people never factor in. There's the obvious cost of employing people 24/7, but you also need to factor in the cost of power cooling. You'll find that, typically, you've overprovisioned the metal because you're a large, successful company, and you have to manage the peak. You can't just deploy rack and stack servers on demand, much like you can deploy cloud infrastructure on demand. There's really a lot of implicit costs that have never been shown in a Total Cost of Ownership model of on-premises versus cloud.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I have the same impression that whenever I discuss prices, people somehow compare the cost of cloud versus the cost of only having servers.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: From my experience, it's always the apples-versus-oranges comparison. Companies just look at that monthly bill, and fail to understand the shift from CAPEX to OPEX, or they haven't articulated that with their CFO well enough, if at all. You can't just say, "I'm moving to the cloud, and I'm done," and then get the bill, because you don't understand the security controls in place, or how to manage them properly.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Whether true or perceived, lack of visibility is also a challenge. I can't see my servers, and I can't just walk into the data center. I may have people doing shadow cloud deployments, so there are more instances running than I know about. You also have to have proper governance around cloud usage, and I think people don't go into that with their eyes wide open and prepared.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I get the impression that DevOps is moving away from being operations-based and becoming more development-oriented as we're developing data centers. Nowadays, everybody's becoming a software developer, not only those coding your applications.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: Yeah, it goes back to Marc Andreessen's manifesto of software leading the world, because we're moving to software-defined everything. Software-defined infrastructure, networking, and security. There are a few companies now doing software-defined power, power leveling, and load leveling. I think everything is becoming programmatic, which is why—once again, going back to my common thread—everybody needs to have an engineering or a developer mindset.</p>
			<div>

					<p class="qt">"Everything is becoming programmatic, which is why—once again, going back to my common thread—everybody needs to have an engineering or a developer mindset."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Mike Kail</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: That might then be similar to what we were experiencing a while ago with testing. The idea that when automation became a thing, testers who don't know how to write code became very defensive or scared. Maybe something similar is happening with operations right now.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: That and security as well. Because at the base of the stack, both QA testing—classic QA testing and security testing—are very similar. You're looking for anomalies and issues, whether there are security vulnerabilities or there's other application issues or bugs. Those have all been manual processes, and they delayed the overall deployment process, which causes that contention, which leads you to be defensive of what you're doing, instead of being collaborative.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: That's like moving from acting as a gatekeeper or a policeman to being more of a collaborator.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: It's about moving from being a blocker to an enabler. How do you still provide your testing—whether it's security or performance—as fast as possible to not add friction to the deployment and delivery processes?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: True. No conversation these days can exclude Kubernetes containers in some regard. Do you have any opinion on that? Is Kubernetes really going to become the one ring to rule them all?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: I'm a big believer and supporter of Kubernetes in general, I'll start with that. But if you take a survey, many, if not most, enterprises are still struggling with virtualizing and moving to cloud virtual machines.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">The leap across the chasm to get to containers is a long one. You can't just deploy your application in Kubernetes, Mesos, or whatever your container orchestration environment is. Now you magically have microservices, an auto-scaling application that is resilient, performant, and cost-effective. There's no magic. I think there are very few container-native applications, especially outside of Silicon Valley.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Jumping into the valley</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Does that mean companies should not jump into whatever is "today"? If you're not into virtualization, don't jump into containers. If you're not into cloud-native applications, don't think about deploying to cloud.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: I think you first have to ask yourself, "Why are we doing that, and why does that matter for our business?" You need to tie that to potential results versus it being the newest and coolest technology that's going to make you cooler than Facebook, because that won't happen.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">As developers or DevOps cultural employees, we tend to become overly enamored of technology. Just look at how Kubernetes is so cool or how containers and clouds are so great. But you need to tie that back to why you are doing this. Why does it matter for the business, and what benefits is this application going to have from being cloud-native or container-native?</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I'm a big pro-cloud, pro-software-defined person, and I think there's plenty of ways to justify that. But you need to make sure that your culture is ready for that technical transformation, and that you have the right people to handle the process and technology components.</p>

					<p class="qt">"As developers or DevOps cultural employees, we tend to become overly enamored of technology."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Mike Kail</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: How often do you think that companies actually even understand the reasoning behind it? Do they jump into those things because they really understand why they want to do it or is somebody coming and saying, "Thou shalt become Agile!"</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: I think there's probably a lot of dictatorships that take a stick-versus-carrot approach. You have some people, or a team, inside the company that says, "Look. We're going to do Agile," or, "We're going to do DevOps." This is not the right approach.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Much like a start-up trying to raise funding, you have to go in and do a proper presentation. You go to the higher-ups and tell them what you're proposing and why. You show the efficiencies and keep making sure that it's not a one-and-done situation and that everybody's on board for this continual transformation and evolution.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: In other words, people should come to you, rather than you telling people where to go?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: I think it's asynchronous. It's not me or somebody internally preaching at people. It's actually getting them engaged and collaborating, which is the biggest part of a DevOps culture. Without collaboration, you don't have anything.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: You mentioned Silicon Valley a couple of times. Do you see a big difference inside and outside of the Valley?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: I do. I think in the Valley, we're the first to hear about the latest hype. For example, Docker's been around for some time, but in the last two years of my travels it seemed that no one really understood what a container was. I went to a group of executives at an organization and asked them to give me a definition of a container. If there were 15 people in the room, I'd get 12 different answers, including some arguments as well.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: But if there's a big gap, do you think that those running behind can actually catch up? I'd really be interested in knowing if there's hope for digital transformation. Is there a chance that big enterprises will really become competitive, or is it a lost battle?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: It's somewhat of a religious topic because it really comes down to the internal workings of the given company. I've seen too many large enterprises get in their own way, and they're still mired in this annual budgetary cycle mentality. I'm pretty sure Amazon doesn't operate that way. I'll put my hands up and say I've got no intimate knowledge of Amazon's inner workings, but as fast as they move, they're not doing an annual budget cycle and kicking the can down the road when it comes to new transformation and transformative initiatives.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Too many enterprises are just content with the status quo or the soundbite because, mentally, that's the way they've always done things. Until you remove or change that mindset, there's no amount of technology that can help you.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: It reminds me of that truism: every company is a software company. Now, assuming that you think that's true, how does this coincide with externalizing your world? Because, obviously, nobody externalizes core business.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: Are you talking about open source initiatives?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: No. Not open source—for example, say you're a big bank or insurance firm that outsources all your software development to a third party. I'm trying to figure out how somebody can say that software is important when they don't develop it in house.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: I think you need to keep the core IP or crown jewels of your business close to your chest, and not outsource, offshore, or nearshore them. You need to protect, to some degree, the core features of your business, or at least what gives you strategic differentiation. Maybe you can then rely on third-party developers for everything else.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I think a lot of people believe that offshoring or passing work to third-party developers is less expensive, but I think given time zone challenges and, in particular, language and cultural barriers, that's not often the case. It's like on-premises versus cloud: people don't compare apples and apples.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: True. Is that because it's like counting the price per head, not per the outcome?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: Exactly!</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">What's n<a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>ext after DevOps?</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: So, what's coming next? I don't know if you want to look a month down the line or even several years, but where are we going as an industry?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: We hear the word "bubble" mentioned a lot, but compared to the real bubble of 1999/2000, today's technology is pervasive in all of our lives in Silicon Valley. If I look at buzzwords, I think blockchain will start becoming more and more prevalent. Once people understand where it's applicable, it will be a game-changing technology in a bunch of different sectors. However, there will be scaling and growing challenges that I don't think a lot of people have thought about.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Not to conflate blockchain with cryptocurrency, but I think we'll see cryptocurrency becoming much more well-formed, as we've seen more recently. For example, only the other day, the payment company Square announced they're allowing trading in crypto, which will allow new businesses and opportunities to be built around that.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent end">The other area, which is still in its early stages, is artificial intelligence. How do we leverage AI in positive ways for business and humanity in order to remove biases from them?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Theoretically, that should actually also affect engineering. Are we moving in a direction where we'll end up programming AI so AI can program everything else?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: I think every role I've had in my technology career has eventually gone away. Again, as we mentioned before, there's that fear. Realistically, I think it's still a long way before AI eliminates all our jobs. Quite the opposite, actually: I'm more of the mindset that AI will create more opportunities.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">We want to eliminate the menial tasks by leveraging some machine learning—which is a component of AI—to make your job more efficient. Then you can spend time on higher-order things. I think that's what we'll see, and when people understand that, they'll be successful. The ones who sit around worrying about their job or position going away are the ones that are probably not going to be long for that position in general.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: As we wrap up this interview, is there anything you would like to add that we haven't covered yet?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: I think my closing message is that we're all still early in the DevOps transformation. There are still plenty of cultural opportunities out there to make a difference and actually make things much more efficient.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: It's not really a standalone project then, but more a never-ending story.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: I'd describe it as transformation or continuous evolution. You're never done transforming the DevOps sector. There's always an area of <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>the business or aspects to improve upon with respect to performance.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: That's why I don't like the term "digital transformation." For some reason, it sends a message to my brain that this is something with a definite start and ending.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Mike Kail</strong>: It's not a project with a finite endpoint. I'll go back and use the Amazon example. I would guess that they're always thinking about digital transformation, and there's plenty of inefficient parts of our society and world that could be improved by digital transformation.</p>
