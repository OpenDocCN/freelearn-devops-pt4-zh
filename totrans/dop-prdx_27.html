			<h2 class="introHdg"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Introducing Chris Riley</h2>
			<p class="intro"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Based in the Greater Denver Area, Chris Riley is a self-proclaimed bad coder turned editor of Sweetcode.io at Fixate IO, a content marketing firm for those who sell to technical audiences. Through this, he's involved with DevOps, SecOps, big data, machine learning, and blockchain. He's a member of the DevOps Institute Board of Regents, a position he's held for over four years. You can follow him on Twitter at <code class="inline">@HoardingInfo</code>.<a id="_idTextAnchor044"/></p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I know your career has mainly revolved around your work as an analyst. But you're also the editor of Sweetcode. How did you get to where you are?</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">A bad coder turned industry analyst</h2>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Chris Riley</strong>: My answer can best be summed up by the fact that I'm a bad coder turned industry analyst. While I couldn't make it as a coder, I had a big passion for software development practices, building applications, and the processes around that. So, instead of trying to transform my skill set and become a better coder, what I decided to do was really focus on understanding the industry. So, I became a DevOps analyst in addition to being the editor of Sweetcode.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Career-wise, my last employer was a company called CloudShare, which was a DevTest environment specifically for large line-of-business application development; in other words, a SharePoint-, SAP-, or Oracle-type application. At CloudShare, I worked in product management, so I was essentially driving the direction of the product and keeping tabs on the market.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I'm also doing a lot of write-ups for DevOps.com, O'Reilly, and TechTarget. My content focuses on how organizations assimilate modern development practices and a lot of cheerleading to enterprises to encourage them to make a move. I became very familiar with the market, which included playing with a lot of the tools myself. But after that, I started Sweetcode, which is now a more developer-focused site with a lot of really strong tactical content.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">What is DevOps?</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I'd like to start with a question that will probably sound very silly to you: what is DevOps?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Chris Riley</strong>: I believe very passionately that DevOps is not a thing that you can simply do. You don't just say that, on a specific time and date, you "did" DevOps. "Doing DevOps" should never be a phrase anybody ever utters because you're never "done" with DevOps.</p>
			<div>

					<p class="qt">"You don't just say that, on a specific time and date, you 'did' DevOps. 'Doing DevOps' should never be a phrase anybody ever utters because you're never 'done' with DevOps."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Chris Riley</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent">DevOps is not a thing; it's a principle, it's a practice, and it's what you use to drive all of your decisions on how you build your delivery chain. That means it encompasses everything from the dreaded word "culture" to implementation. A great example is if you walk into the door of Slack and take a look at their development environment. You might say, "Wow, look at you guys: your developers are supporting their own code. If they build it, they support it, and you're releasing hundreds of times a day. You guys have continuous delivery—this is amazing! You guys have done it, you have hit the jackpot—you are DevOps."</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">You can't say that because the "you are DevOps" element is not actually a thing. As we saw with Slack, they have been and always will be trying to figure out how to do a better job. That's what DevOps is. They're always thinking how they can do something better, even though, from an outsider's point of view, it might look like they have the best development environment and delivery chain in the world. They're still thinking, "How can we do this better? What can we automate more? What can we make go faster? How can we do more releases?" If you're concerned about better-quality software and releasing it faster and more frequently, then you're "doing DevOps," and you don't even need to call it DevOps. That's what I think DevOps is.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I feel as if you're describing an extended version of Agile, or at least something similar to that.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Chris Riley</strong>: I disagree. While Agile was more cut and dried, with clearly a more defined system of operations, DevOps is a bit more ethereal and philosophical. The reason that's so important is because of Agile, or even before that, what we learned with Waterfall development practices.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">If you're an organization that thinks you're going to take on a project to implement DevOps, and that, by the end of the day, you're going to be doing workable DevOps, what you're actually going to have is a <em class="italics">DevOps shop</em>. What happens is, as soon as you've done that, the <em class="italics">DevOps shop</em> is no longer DevOps. It's dead, because, for instance, CloudBees has acquired Codeship and suddenly you need to reconsider how you're doing continuous integration because, possibly, you're using a different release automation tool, and now you need to consider, "Is my release automation tool different, or is there a new generation out?"</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">If you architect your delivery chain too rigidly and say, "This is our DevOps delivery chain," to the point that you can't adapt the next thing that comes out, you're not practicing DevOps. In DevOps, you're always looking forward. You're always looking at what's next, with the idea being that we don't end up in a cycle where six months down the road, after building something, we're then saying, "Oh, man, this is old. We need to retool again because so much is changing, and it's better, and we weren't prepared for that, and we didn't know things were going to change," which would be the most ridiculous statement in the tech field, period.</p>

					<p class="qt">"You really can't get a certification in the principles and the philosophy of DevOps. As soon as you think you can, you have already alienated the environment."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Chris Riley</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent end">That's where I'm uncomfortable about DevOps being a principle and philosophy, because it makes it much harder to manage and build a DevOps environment. It becomes a very large people problem, and people problems are the hardest problems to solve. You can't ignore that fact.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I completely agree. That's why I get a bit disappointed when I go to conventions, as you do, and I see all of those commercials advertising every tool that I knew from three years ago as being DevOps-certified. It's very much, "Buy this, and you become DevOps." I don't know if you have the same feeling, but I'm freaking out because it's too commercialized.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Chris Riley</strong>: I'm a regent of the DevOps Institute. They started by offering courses on the high-level aspects of DevOps and culture, but they have since adapted and are now focusing a lot on tactics. You really can't get a certification in the principles and the philosophy of DevOps. As soon as you think you can, you have already alienated the environment. What you can get certified in are the specific processes and implementations.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Even in release automation, things are changing. It's not a static environment.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">The speed of change</h2>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">V</strong><strong class="bold">iktor Farcic</strong>: You're right about the speed of change being tremendous. In today's world, it's impossible to follow. If we stick with your Jenkins examples, in a couple of years' time, it moved from one container scheduler to another, it got a few hundred new plugins, new UIs, ditched the <em class="italics">old way</em> of defining jobs in favor of the everything-as-code philosophy, and so on. Jenkins is only one of many examples. I'm lucky that my job allows me to spend more time learning new tech than most other people, and yet I have a constant feeling of falling behind.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Moving on, though, I saw that you're very focused on transitions from one culture to another. You've spoken with a range of people, from those in big enterprises to those in small start-ups. Have you seen any patterns or differences between the approaches?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Chris Riley</strong>: It's changed a lot in the last four years from when I had the initial conversations with an enterprise, when most people were opportunistic and saying, "Oh, yeah, we're considering DevOps. That's good. We know something new is coming." Then, you had this bifurcation of the small start-ups building bottom-up DevOps shops or principles.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">I shouldn't say that because I just said DevOps is not a thing. In the early days of DevOps, it was almost as if you had this exclusive members-only DevOps club where enterprises need not apply. The mindset was, "Hey, let's leave this to the secret club of people who know how to release software really fast." But then it changed very, very quickly, and enterprises very quickly jumped on board. However, the huge wave of adoption didn't actually come until Docker. When Docker came out, it felt like Docker was already behind, so enterprises picked up the pace a little bit, and you saw a lot more adoption because Docker was so pervasive.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">What I should say is <em class="italics">containers</em> were so pervasive that enterprises accepted and bought into DevOps immediately. So, it happened very quickly. The bifurcation was not as big. What's big is that enterprises don't have the luxury of just ripping out everything and starting over, whereas start-ups can tool their entire delivery chain to be in line with the DevOps methodology.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">DevOps in the tech industry</h2>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Sometimes there is an advantage in starting late. Start-ups created now don't have the baggage that bigger and older companies have. Not being able to erase history often slows us down, and in an industry like ours, where everything can change from one day to another, being a start-up without legacy applications can be a huge advantage.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">With that frame of mind, how do you promote new values, processes, and tools? I guess it doesn't matter whether it is DevOps or something else; there should be a mechanism that a company can use to propagate change.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer110">
					<p class="qt">"Application development will generally buy into DevOps, as will most organizations. If they don't, then you have an HR problem."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Chris Riley</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Chris Riley</strong>: The coolest thing I've seen in enterprises, and it works really well, is adoption via stewardship. These companies have built—and I hate this term—Centers of Excellence, where they will build an awesome DevOps environment and culture somewhere within the organization. It will do a great job of cranking out the code for maybe a very small, not super-critical mission application, and they will use that, and they will steward it across the organization.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Some organizations use it as a political thing, and they will steward more naturally, such as promoting internally, whereas other organizations make a structure out of it. In fact, there's a very large media company in the US where that's exactly what they do.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">They have this small DevOps environment that invests in tools and the processes. They say, "Hey, development teams! We have a thousand small development teams (I don't know if it's a thousand, but it's a lot of small 10- and 20-person development teams). All of you out there are doing your thing, and you're doing it your way and that's fine. However, if you want us to support you, which means both budget and technical support, then you're going to have to use one of the tools that the DevOps team created." That's a very natural driver rather than having to say, "Oh, we probably should get on board with it," and they do.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">With this particular media company, it's a little bit easier because their development teams are so separate from each other. They have a development team for each media site that they own. There's a lot of them, so it's a little bit easier because they're already structured with the two teams, versus, say, a bank that is structured with one monolithic team. Even in large banks, what they have is called the shared services division, and that's a buttered layer between IT and application development and the shared services that will buy into DevOps.</p>
			<p class="normal indent"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Application development will generally buy into DevOps, as will most organizations. If they don't, then you have an HR problem. The hard part is integrating with the IT team. What shared services do is approve processes and tools. They negotiate with IT on what could be used and what can't be used on behalf of the developers, and it works. It's a big effort, but it all works at the end of the day.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">And I think that's really cool because enterprise adoption is always an excuse, but I don't think it is anymore because a lot of people will just say, "Yes, DevOps is really cool, but we're too big." The whole "We're too big" response isn't adequate, but I think a lot of enterprises have tuned into that.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic:</strong> When I hear companies use "We're too big" as an excuse—and I hear it quite often—my first thought is always, "No, your culture isn't ready. The type of organization structure or the communication within your company is not aligned."</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Chris Riley</strong>: Yes, and unless these companies initiate a DevOps strategy, they're going to fall behind the competition. Eventually, they're just not going to have a choice, because somebody's application is going to be better. For instance, Amazon is going to come and enter healthcare, which is now what Amazon is talking about doing. So, now hospitals have to worry about having ease of use and quality applications.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: When those things happen, when somebody truly disrupts the industry, that results in the industry's need to suddenly change for the better. It leaves me wondering whether it's already too late when that happens.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Chris Riley</strong>: It is, and it isn't. This isn't related to DevOps, but before Satya Nadella came on board as the current CEO at Microsoft, it felt as though Microsoft was too late. And then they did it, but they could do it because they had the money. It's the sheer power of cash behind them.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">You know, what's funny to me is that there's a very large financial institution that's famous in the DevOps space for building its own open source DevOps tool. But a small division within this organization already reaches out to the DevOps community on a regular basis—and they're not even connected to the group who are developing this tool—asking consultants to come in and explain to them what DevOps is. It's absolutely baffling. You have an entire team that's going around talking about how amazing the DevOps is, who have built their own tool, and it's great, but the team developing the tool doesn't even know this other division exists! But back to your point. It's like your structure is broken; you have a communication problem that means something is seriously wrong.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Exactly. Have you ever been in a situation where somebody says, "Oh we tried it and we failed. This does not work, and this was all a waste of effort?"</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Chris Riley</strong>: Oh, yeah, the partial-attempt-and-failure response. It's akin to saying you're too big.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">What I do is ask, "What aspect of the DevOps methodology did you try to input? Did you try to go directly to continuous delivery? Because that's not a good idea. Why don't you automate testing first? Let's automate something smaller. Don't go to canary releases tomorrow and tell me, "Oh, we did the canary release thing; it released some software too fast and people were pissed." If you say that, then my response would simply be, "Why did you pick that? Automate something else."</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I've heard the story that nobody can skip through time if you don't know what automation is. They say that you're going to fail to implement containers because your gap is going to be too big to jump into something.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Chris Riley</strong>: I don't think you can jump in there, and more widely, that mentality has been a problem all along, where people think that a tool is going to solve the problem. They think Jenkins is a release automation tool in the DevOps market, and that if they buy into it then they've done DevOps right, because Jenkins is going to bring DevOps to their organization, and then they're done. That mentality never works. If you expect the tool to do it for you, then you're wrong.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Bottom-up or top-down?</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: That's why I think it's very dangerous when you buy into tools that promise certain cultural changes just by existing. In your view, then, what works better: bottom-up or top-down? And more specifically, when there's an initiative, where should it come from?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Chris Riley</strong>: I'm going to answer that a little bit differently because I think both questions, in their own ways, are critical. But that being said, if I had to pick one, I would say bottom-up. If you have an issue with bottom-up development, as in you have a developer who's telling you they don't want to focus on building the application and they don't want to get it out the door faster, then you have the wrong developer. If that's your problem, then that presents you with a bigger challenge, because you shouldn't have to explain to a developer why building an application and speed to market are good.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">For that reason, when looking at bottom-up versus top-down, I think 90% of the effort is top-down because that's where the biggest hurdle is. This is something that's very common in quality assurance teams, or Quality Engineering (QE) teams, who are driven to do something new because they believe in automation. They have this holistic point of view of the entire delivery chain. They see everything. But QE teams never have a budget, ever, and they have to justify to research and development teams (R&amp;D), who may have to then justify to somebody else in order to gain the budgets to get functional testing tools for Selenium, for instance.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">That's the hardest part. And when these people go to those decision makers, if those decision makers don't understand the value of DevOps, they may not say it's dumb; but they may say you can't do that, or they may just be dismissive because they don't understand how it's going to impact the bottom line. It's becoming easier to explain, because you can very easily see a lot of industries now point to very high-quality applications that are getting better customer satisfaction, more customer engagement, and actually impacting the bottom line.</p>

					<p class="qt">—Chris Riley</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent">That's changing minds, and sometimes, changing minds is impossible. But you also have the problem of compensation structures. If the operations teams are compensated for making sure stuff never breaks, then they're in a direct conflict of interest with the developers who are compensated for making sure that they get the application out of the door. Operations don't want anything to change, ever, because when things change, things can break.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">When IT operations are focused on the fact that they don't want developers to release anything, they're naturally going to become a bottleneck. So, compensation and organizational structures can only be changed from the top down. Going from 100-person development teams to 5- to 10-person development teams is just another big structural change that can only happen top-down. I just think that's where the effort goes, and the effort has to be spent.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: When you mentioned developer teams, do you refer to self-sufficient teams that can develop and operate?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Chris Riley</strong>: I know there are different ways of approaching this, but the cool thing about containers and microservices is that they're not just infrastructure tools; they're also application architecture tools. If you start to consider building and breaking your application down into services, you naturally run into the fact that we need smaller development teams because, for example, you don't need 100 people writing a login service. You only need two. I think this new architecture naturally takes organizations that way, which is cool, but they have to be ready for that change. That being said, I still gravitate toward the small teams that have a DevOps engineer, developers, and quality assurance folk.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I have not, with the exception of some very rare environments, bought into the idea that if you build it, then you also test it and support it. I do think if you test it, you need to test your own code, but somebody else is creating the automation. I don't think that it's appropriate to go to a developer and say, "You need to write Selenium scripts for your code," because it will never get done. Somebody else has to be doing that. I still think that there is a need for that QE unit, either a team that butters across all developers or individuals within smaller teams.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">DevOps departments</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: What do you think about DevOps departments then? I'm seeing quite a lot of them today, especially in enterprises. When I take a closer look at these enterprises, I'm told they're going to form this DevOps department that will be in charge of doing DevOps for the whole company.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Chris Riley</strong>: Going back to that large media company I referenced earlier, that's what they do. They implement but they're not responsible for implementing organization-wise. They're more responsible for knowing both what the best practices and the best tools are. What they do implement organization-wise are things such as chatbots, integrations with AWS or whatever the cloud provider is, and things that truly are tools that you would use because what they're integrating with is global.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Everybody uses Slack, so they can create things for Slack. Everybody is using the same cloud, so they can create things for this cloud. That's where I think you have a DevOps department. I don't think it's necessarily true that you go into any organization and say, "We need to form a DevOps department," and then that's the answer to the problem.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">"DevOps engineer," as a title, makes sense to me, but I don't think you necessarily have DevOps <em class="italics">departments</em>, nor do you seek that out. Instead, I think DevOps is a principle that you spread throughout your entire development organization. You should look to reform your organization in a way that supports those initiatives versus just saying that you need to build this DevOps unit, and there you go, you're done—you're DevOps. Because by doing that, you really have to empower that unit, and most organizations aren't willing to do that. You can't just set people off on a race to build DevOps and then not give them the tools to actually do it. I think that's normally what happens next if you just build a DevOps organization.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer112">
					<p class="qt">"'DevOps engineer,' as a title, makes sense to me, but I don't think you necessarily have DevOps departments, nor do you seek that out."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Chris Riley</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: In my view, having a DevOps department creates another silo. I heard once—and it's a description that I really like—that DevOps is all about empathy, and that by joining different people together in the same team, you develop empathy in people, and they finally understand each other's pain.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Chris Riley</strong>: The only problem with saying things like that is the CFO doesn't give a shit about empathy, and the person with the money may not care about that at all. The HR department might, but that's the problem with selling anything. You have to speak their language, and the CFO is going to respond to money. Either you're saving us money, or you're making us more money, and I think DevOps is doing both, which is cool. I think what's nice about that explanation is the fact it doesn't seem insurmountable. It's kind of like how Pixar was structured.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">After Steve Jobs started at Pixar, he structured all of the work environments where the idea was to create chance encounters among the employees, so that the graphic designer of one movie would talk to the application developer of another, even when they don't even have any real reason to interact with each other. The way they did it at Pixar was that, as everybody has to go to the bathroom, they put the bathrooms in a large communal area where these people are going to run into each other—that's what created that empathy. They understand what each other's job is. They're excited about each other's movies. They're excited about what they're working on, and they're aware of that in everything they do. It's a really good explanation.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I agree that CFOs and the young people very high up on the corporate ladder mostly understand money. How do you translate that? What do you say and what will you earn if you do DevOps? How is it translated into money and how do you measure it?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Chris Riley</strong>: Sometimes it seems like it doesn't measure directly. When I talk to organizations who are building line-of-business applications and the internal applications they use to do their job, I explain things differently because, in that context, user satisfaction doesn't matter as much. Their users aren't paying them, and they're not going to up and leave. They're going to do what they're told.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">There is something to be said for customer satisfaction. Coming from the SharePoint space, this is something I know very well. If people inside the organization don't like SharePoint, they won't use SharePoint. By virtue of not using SharePoint, you're not hitting your initiative. So, users do matter, as does user experience, which is both look and feel as well as keeping things up to date and addressing issues when they come up. If somebody has a bug, it gets fixed.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Typically, in the line-of-business scenario, it's going to take you at least three months to fix that bug, by which point your customers—who are typically internal users who hate their jobs—are less productive. That effect then snowballs. So, that's the line-of-business case.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">If you're a bank, you're trying to not lose customers, because it's a highly competitive market, and by default, everybody hates banks. Firstly, you'll want to create a customer experience that reduces costs because people are not engaging with your branches and calling your customer support line as much. Secondly, you can release new offerings—the new checking account, whatever it is—faster, which means that you can get customers of those offerings faster and engage more of them. All of these things are not going to be deliverable unless you have a really powerful application, and that powerful application is going to have bugs because bugs happen. You need to be able to respond to those bugs because the customer today is highly critical, and you can't change the customer.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">You're also going to have to adapt to how your customer uses applications and what they expect. What they expect is an app that works. They want to see you making frequent changes, resolving problems faster, and being responsive to their usage behavior. All of this is an expectation now, and unless you're an organization that thinks you're powerful enough to change the world's user behavior, you need to be able to respond to that because, if you don't, you'll lose customers no matter what you do; or at the very least, you're just going to have angry customers who are going to need more support, which, in turn, is going to be more expensive for you to work with your customer base, and it's going to be harder to sell them new things.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: That's a valid point and one I find quite interesting.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Chris Riley</strong>: Really, any organization can relate to the bottom line of either losing customers and not being able to compete, or not being able to execute on new initiatives fast enough. It's all boiling down to that day. To me, it seems like a no-brainer. If you're in a room with somebody who's really going to fight against this, then all I can think is, "OK, it's going to happen to you whether you know it or not."</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Take Apple, for instance. Apple is going into banking in a very sneaky way. It's going to creep up on these banks with Apple Pay because now, with Apple Pay, I can send you a text message with money. If you don't have a linked card, you now have credit with Apple and an account with Apple, and they're just doing that because they can. It should scare the banks.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I think it's exactly like, "OK, it'll happen to you, and you're going to regret it." You'll lose your job, but then, at the next company you go into, you're going to be the biggest DevOps champion in that company because of the experience you had in your previous job.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: While I agree with you on many of the things we've spoken about, I have the impression that you are mostly referring to in-house development. Do you have any thoughts about what happens to companies that externalize their software, making it a commodity?</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Outsourcing and the commoditization of software</h2>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Chris Riley</strong>: That's an interesting point, and I'm going to be bold. I don't want to alienate an industry, but I think that these outsourced companies have hopefully embraced DevOps because they have to support their customers, as well as because they want to build applications faster and better.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">That being said, I believe that technology is becoming such a core component of business these days that it's a huge mistake to outsource your application development. I just don't think it's something that companies should be doing. Having experienced something like that before, I know how it works and I know the negotiations that happen because you have to succumb to the development firm's limitations, skill sets, or whatever it is. Making changes and the complexity around that is difficult. I just don't think that any organization should consider outsourcing unless something is just not financially feasible. But you have to be honest with yourself when you say that you're building a mediocre application if it's an issue of money, and you have to be OK with that, and you have to know that, at some point in time, you're going to have to make the switch back from outsourcing.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">For example, there's a company that builds an influencer marketing platform, and the first three versions of it were not great, mainly because it was super buggy. But the platform solved a problem, people were interested, it worked, and they got customers—but it wasn't great. This company then decided to go in-house, and when they went in house, they focused on hiring a development manager that understood DevOps and everything changed. Because of that switch, their application quality went through the roof. It just was awesome, and this is a very small company, and now their platform is very cool.</p>

			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I think it's only a question of whether a company has already realized that they're a software company. If they are, then software development is a core business, and nobody disputes that you do not externalize core business. It's all about whether a company is aware that every company is a software company today.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">With that being said, I'm curious about trust. How do you trust an external company will do such important work well? Can you outsource development and yet maintain control and quality?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Chris Riley</strong>: You see the same on a dating site, which is typically fully outsourced. I think this is interesting from a SecOps and application development perspective. AshleyMadison.com is a great example. All of their development was outsourced, and we've all seen how that worked out for them. They blindly accepted what was being developed, and it turned out to be a massive exploit and just really dumb. I believe it should be illegal for organizations not to encrypt passwords in their database. If you do that, then you should be breaking some sort of law, because it's not fair to any of your users, because you don't have control over that data when you outsource, really.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I just believe that organizations need to have their development in-house and the only reason to outsource is if it's just not financially possible. If it's not financially possible, you have to realize you're only going to outsource for a short amount of time.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: To be honest, you have to question the concept of financial feasibility when you've seen how much work a single good developer can do, even though they might be expensive.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Chris Riley</strong>: No doubt. We've experienced this at Sweetcode, and that's why I'm kind of impassioned about it. We have a platform internally that we use to streamline the process of doing research, deciding what we want to write about based on that research, finding one of our contributors to write it, and then writing it and publishing it.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">We have a platform that streamlines the process, so it takes less manual effort to get it done. We have written this platform three times now. The first time I wrote it, it sucked really bad. The second time, we went to an outsourced company. I know enough about application development as I'm really good at architecture, so I was in a luxurious position where I could review their code because I knew what was going on. Most organizations don't have this. I realized the quality was horrible. The thing worked, but the quality was so bad that any new developer coming on board was not going to be able to take it on. In that situation, the best option was to rewrite.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">The only thing I would say is that, for those who don't know anything about application development and have a great idea, they may have to turn to a firm for expertise, and that's a bad position to be in. I mean, if you're a founder, it's almost like every company has to have an application, just as every start-up has to have a technical founder.</p>

			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Does that mean if I externalize something, then that something is probably a thing that I don't consider within the realm of my core business? That sounds to me as if it translates into, "Oh, software is not really important for me. Let me put it in the same box as cleaning services," or something along those lines.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Chris Riley</strong>: You're right—I mean, what do we outsource at our company? We outsource our legal, which is actually pretty damn important, our bookkeeping, our CPA, and our HR. We are not in the business of law or accounting or HR.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">You're absolutely right that they're all good quality services, but it's not important enough for us, for the product and the offering that we're building, to try to bring those in-house. I think you're right, though, that if you don't give it enough consideration, then you just don't care.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: To finish up, I was wondering whether you had any advice for those just starting their DevOps journey.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Starting your journey in DevOps</h2>
			<p class="normal"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/><strong class="bold">Chris Riley</strong>: The DevOps culture will come no matter what. It could come with a bloody mess or some kumbaya moment, but it will come on its own as long as organizations focus on automation and releasing better applications sooner.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">For that reason, I don't recommend that organizations waste time talking about communication or culture. Instead, I think they should be putting quotas on the number of releases a day, response time to issues, and the percentage of automation. They should make these objectives tied to bonuses and job performance.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">If the organization pushes<a id="_idIndexMarker030"/> the needle to have more frequent releases and better application quality, then they will figure out the culture, and they'll figure out how to communicate better, because these will all be major barriers. </p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Some will figure it out via employee attrition, and others after lots of arguments. But at the same time, that same organization would have distorted the lessons of culture to begin with, had it been taught top-down.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: That's brilliant. Thank you very much for your time.</p>
