			<h2 class="introHdg">The journey to DevOps</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I'd like to start with a quick introduction. Can you tell us a little about yourself and how you got into DevOps?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: Between 2005 and 2007, I was a part of a boutique consulting organization that focused on what are now called deployment pipelines. Back then, web-scale services were still a fairly new idea, but we were experts in configuring and deploying applications at scale.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">When the industry started to become more cloud-oriented, whether it was virtualized in VMware or the nascent AWS EC2, everything became part of the software stack. We found that this actually suited us as we mostly came from an operations-heavy background. Between 2007 and 2009, it became obvious that scale was no longer the issue; the technical aspect of deployment was becoming a solved problem.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">The challenge, as we were being told by our customers, was they wanted to be able to get things done more quickly, moving at a pace where they can learn and outpace their competitors. This led us to become accidental Lean consultants, with clients saying, "This automation works great, but we've noticed that we're not as fast as those other people who have the same automation. Why aren't we getting any better while they are?"</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">That's what got us into the whole Lean movement. We were looking back, past Agile, at things like the Toyota Production System, Deming, Goldratt, and more, decoding why one organization gets stuff done, goes faster, and produces things of higher quality when other organizations can't. We were self-taught and learned a lot through the trial-and-error method as there wasn't much of a body of knowledge around applying these techniques across the full development and operations life cycle.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: From the timeline that you're talking about, it seems that was right at the same time the DevOps movement took off. You must have been at ground zero when this whole concept first kicked off.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: I was, along with people like Patrick Debois, John Willis, Andrew Shafer, and John Allspaw, right as Patrick lit the DevOps spark by organizing the first DevOps Days. In fact, I was the one that sent the email to get Gene Kim, known then primarily as the author of <em class="italics">Visible Ops</em>, to come to the first DevOps Days, a conference he had never heard of before.</p>

					<p class="qt">"We were especially interested in DevOps in the enterprise because that is where DevOps problems—the ones that are really sticky and problematic—really live."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Damon Edwards</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent">What my colleague Alex Honor and I brought to the conversation was an enterprise-centric, operations-first perspective. A lot of people were interested in extending Agile all the way through deployment, but instead, we were more interested in operations reaching back toward development. We were especially interested in DevOps in the enterprise because that is where DevOps problems—the ones that are really sticky and problematic—really live.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">If you're a small organization or even a high-scale, single-purpose-built web organization, your DevOps problems all have simple answers. Yes, it takes effort and thoughtfulness, but the path forward is clear. All you need to do is get everyone into the same room, tell them to stop doing it the old way, and instead do it the new way, and your problems will generally go away with straightforward effort.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Now, try that in a large, complex enterprise where you have multiple business lines usually gathered—some by acquisition and some by organic growth—over decades. You have one of everything of every kind of technology, in addition to having a huge spread of people, skills, mindsets, and processes, and it's this large, distributed organization with thousands of people across dozens of political structures all over the globe where it's difficult to implement system changes. That's a whole different animal that's very hard to deal with; those are the big nasty DevOps problems.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: You're now based at Rundeck. Can you talk a bit about your work there?</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Rundeck, Inc. and DevOps</h2>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: Rundeck was born as an open source project in 2010. It filled a gap in the automation toolchain and had what we thought was a modest and helpful community, so we kept it going. Around 2014, we discovered there was something special going on. The first indicator was that we had all of these large, household-name companies calling us for help with Rundeck, and not our consulting services. They would say, "We know that you're consultants, and maybe we'll get to that later, but we're using Rundeck, and we need help here and there."</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Eventually, we figured out that Rundeck was being used by companies to fix the operations end of their DevOps problems. After enough people told us that Rundeck changed their lives, Alex Honor, Greg Schuler, and myself, the three founders of Rundeck Inc, decided to shut down the consulting company and focus on Rundeck. The deciding factor was that we could help a lot more people at scale with a product company than we ever could as consultants.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I have a very rudimentary understanding about Rundeck. Correct me if I'm wrong, but from my understanding, it's kind of like a task executor.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: Technically, that's correct but it's not the exciting use case. Self-service operations are the big value of Rundeck. Operations teams will use Rundeck within their team to create standard operating procedures out of all of the various scripts, tools, commands, and APIs they already have. That delivers a lot of efficiency gains within a team, but things really get interesting when they use the access control feature to give people outside of operations access to those procedures, because that's when they can really rethink how their organization works.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: So, teams use it, but self-service is the main goal?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: Yes, but teams see a lot of benefits from standardizing how they work. The standardization encourages ongoing improvement and experimentation; this is a known Lean technique. Instead of me having a bunch of scripts, you having a bunch of scripts, and someone else having a bunch of scripts, let's put them all into Rundeck. Let's collaborate and say, "Hey, let's just come up with a good way to do these things." So, plug in whatever you have now—scripts, tools, commands, APIs—and Rundeck provides the workflow, notifications, error-handling, user input management, the UI, the API, the logging, and much more.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Rundeck's access control features are really what got people excited because now they're saying, "Well, hey, let's enable teams to do operations activities that traditionally don't do operations activities." A simple example is the classic DevOps idea of letting developers do restarts in production environments. It's a pretty shocking concept in most enterprises. How are you going to do that? You can't give them logins to production environments and say, "Here are your SSH keys, sudo access, and some scripts... good luck!" because that doesn't cut it in the enterprise. It's a complicated enough problem and involves so many groups that most people give up.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">But now, with Rundeck, developers can just say, "Well, let's use Rundeck. Plug in the restart script, run the health checks to make sure it worked, and run the commands to quit the monitoring and manipulate the load balancers. Then, put some extra guardrails around it like constraining user input options, notifications, and error handling." Then they would use Rundeck's access control to safely give the development team the ability to do restarts in production. Likewise, you could just give them the permissions to watch the trusted SRE do restarts in production. Either way, they have better control and visibility, which enables them to distribute the ability to perform operations tasks throughout the broader organization.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">This self-service capability unlocks all these DevOps organizational changes that you see being driven in forward-thinking enterprises. They want to decouple and push control closer to these delivery teams so they can move faster, and operations just stay out of their way.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: It's like centralized management with a strong focus on the empowerment of the rest of the organization.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: That's an interesting way to put it. We recognize that the expertise and capability of operations are not going anywhere, but the idea that there is a central operations organization that does all of the "operations work" can't keep up with today's demands. You need a mechanism where control is distributed, but there are operations experts who maintain oversight.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">That's something that shows up in the Rundeck design philosophy as well. We don't want to be another thing that moves the bits around because you've already got plenty of things out there that do that well, whether it's Chef, Puppet, Ansible, or container orchestrators. We let people use what they want to use and then create the logical procedures out of it that need to span all of those different tools. I think we have all lived under this delusion that one automation tool is going to rule them all, but what we did was embrace the idea that heterogeneity is the preferred reality. Let people do what they need to do to get their job done and focus on helping them to coordinate that work and make it safe.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: What are your thoughts on the commercialization of DevOps and the wider idea of DevOps tools?</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">The commercialization of DevOps</h2>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: It is definitely an interesting topic, because people love to throw their hope into tools. First, it was Puppet. Then, it was Chef. More recently, it was Ansible, but now it's cloud-native and serverless. Each new automation tool is going to take over the world, but then the special project team working on it moves on and it becomes legacy. Now we have one of everything. Meanwhile, someone is saying that if they can bring in another new tool, then that will solve all their problems. It's a cycle that has always been there.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Nowadays, there are a lot of companies with DevOps initiatives, and their people are following the pattern that they've always followed and are looking for a DevOps tool to help them. I don't blame the vendors for offering their tools up as DevOps tools, because most of them are perfectly fine tools that solve specific problems. But don't be surprised when your DevOps problems don't go away, and you have yet another tool to support.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer143">
					<p class="qt">"If anything, there's a Lean lesson in this; you're going to need to let teams make the choices for the tools that they feel like they need to use."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Damon Edwards</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent">If anything, there's a Lean lesson in this; you're going to need to let teams make the choices for the tools that they feel like they need to use. They need to worry about how they integrate, worry about the toolchain architecture, or worry about how you let others plug their tools into other people's tools. This has been a major design point for Rundeck since we first recognized the heterogeneous nature of the enterprise as something to be embraced.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Premature optimization or tool standardization is actually bad for the organization. If you're forcing a team to do something they don't want to do, and they have a good reason for not wanting to do it, then you're just putting an unnecessary burden or friction on top of that team. Heterogeneity is not only a fact of life; we think it's actually a feature. Let the teams do what they need to do in order to be successful, and just worry about how they integrate it with the rest of the organization, making sure the right security and compliance controls are in place.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I completely agree. From my own experience, I'm still having trouble finding a big enterprise that is actually bent that way. I've always had the impression that that's what it's like with DevOps. Everybody talks about DevOps, and every single company in the world has a DevOps initiative—yet nobody's doing it.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: Changing how you work is very difficult in itself. For those who are owning the change, it can feel risky and scary. That's not just from an organization point of view; I'm talking from the personal perspective as well.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Here's an example. You tell people, "Okay, we are going to distribute operational capabilities to delivery teams, so we should make these delivery teams cross-functional. That means we take the headcount out of operations and convert it into more of an SRE skillset. We'll leave some SREs taking care of both the platforms and the specialties that we can't distribute for practical reasons in central teams." That's the idea of cross-functional teams, and it sounds logical, but what are you doing on a human and political level? You're taking away headcount from one group and giving it to another.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">A secret that few will admit in large enterprises is that it's really difficult to know what anybody else is doing. Executives in large organizations need indirect measures to identify performance at different levels of management. Say you're at the director level of a theoretical company—you're four to five levels down from the C level, and you're three to four levels up from the people with their hands on the keyboards, and the senior executives want to know if you are any good: "Is Viktor any good? Is he going places or has his career topped out?"</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: It's great that we're getting into the day-to-day discussion of DevOps, but one thing I would love to know is how it would work in this theoretical company.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: By traditional corporate measures, they might say, "Oh, Viktor seems pretty good. He keeps getting more headcount and more budget. Viktor must be doing something right; we should keep an eye on that Victor, he's going places."</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">You're a rational human being. You care about your career and your family depends on your career. What's the last thing you're going to want to do? Give up a budget or people! You've been conditioned throughout your career to know these are signals that you're either a weak or bad manager. Suddenly, you are a lot warier of an idea to move people out from under you and into other teams. Organizational change is difficult because people have personal and political motivations that often don't align with those of the organization, which is what I find to be the number-one problem.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Then, what's the second problem?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: The second problem is that much of the rewards in corporate culture are designed around delivery. For instance, you landed a huge sale, or you cemented a key partnership—here's your bonus. You delivered a major IT project, took us to the cloud, or you delivered the new Foo service we promised Wall Street, so here's your raise. News of delivery makes it all the way to the boardroom, and so delivery on business-oriented projects is another way to get yourself on that up-and-comer list.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">So, now imagine that you're a development leader incentivized to deliver. You want that glory and the spoils, right? The last thing you want to do is anything that's not delivering! Taking on a bunch of SREs and a shared responsibility for production services means that you're being judged on and committing resources to something other than delivery.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">The right thing for the company to do is to stick with the stuff you've built, keep it running, and evolve it to meet the customer's future needs. But, personally, you're compelled to say, "Forget it, it's done, let someone else worry about that and get me on to a whole new project," because then you'll be Viktor who delivered customer value X last year and then delivered customer value Y this year, which is a fast track to promotion.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer144">
					<p class="qt">"The reality of all of this is that it's very hard to change how people work, which means it's very hard to change large enterprises."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Damon Edwards</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent">The reality of all of this is that it's very hard to change how people work, which means it's very hard to change large enterprises. You'll have a much easier time if you can just bring in that DevOps thing by just painting some existing boxes on the organization chart with some DevOps freshness.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">This is how DevOps has been pigeonholed as a new name for release and systems engineering in so many enterprises. They're not actually doing what makes the DevOps high performers very successful, which is changing how they fundamentally operate. There are a lot of vendors out there who will gladly reinforce this behavior. Why complicate the sale? Just let them do a "DevOps" paint job and declare victory. At the end of the day, this really isn't a technology organizational culture problem; this is a business culture problem.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Netflix works the way it does because of the technology organization; that's how they run their entire business. Amazon works the way it does because that's how Amazon runs their entire business. The same is true of Google. Unless your business wants to change how it operates and what it incentivizes, don't expect the technology organization to act much differently. We can still make a lot of improvements within the walls of the technology organization; just don't expect the business head to be wagged by the technology tail. They still have to figure it out on their own.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: At least from what I've seen, the business side that makes the decision is still used to making that same decision for software development as they are for making any other decision.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: A valid point, because they just see the world from what they do and they're working to their incentives. Because of that, they'll be running things according to their current beliefs. Too many times, you'll see a technology organization telling the business how they should be run and that they need to do things in what is described as the right way, and when the business doesn't do it, there are generally some grumblings about "idiots." Well, the thing is that the business sees it their way too. They know what they need, and they think their way is the rational way to do it, and if the technology side disagrees, then they are being whiney or just don't get it.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Of course, conflict ensues. Everyone thinks they're the rational ones and that what they're doing is best for the company, which is something that we really have to keep in mind. Very few people anywhere in the world show up to their job saying, "How can I screw things up and what stupid thing can I do today?"</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: But in big companies, are people really trying to do the best for their company? I say this because, the way I see it, big companies are actually a collection of smaller companies, whether you call them silos, departments, companies—whatever you want. Do you have the impression that actually doing right for your department is not necessarily right for your company?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: Most people think they're doing the right thing, but I think you bring up a good point. Perspective and context really matter from a business viewpoint. You can look at a big company as more of a portfolio of companies, because the parts can often live somewhat in business isolation, and that isolation encourages siloed behavior. In that situation, you wind up with people who only see a small piece of the larger puzzle, and with that limited view, they do their best for that piece of the puzzle, but not their best for the overall business. To the people in the other pieces of the puzzle, they might think those others aren't acting in the best interest of the company, but those people only have their own limited view. This same silo problem repeats itself all the way down to the classic development and operations divide we see today.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: That's very true, because if you go even deeper, everybody has their own objectives. What is the objective of operations? Never to go down. How do you never go down? Well, by never deploying a new release. I mean, developers want to release every second because they don't care if we go down.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: Exactly. It's easy to think about the thing you are being paid to do and not strive to see the end-to-end system; or equally, it's easy to be accidentally disincentivized to not act in the best interests of the end-to-end system.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">The most striking way to illustrate this is to ask how the customer sees your organization. They see a point of transaction and perhaps a horizontal line of everything that has to happen to make that transaction happen. They don't care about your functional silos or who does what. Does it satisfy them? Is it giving them the functionality that they wanted at the right price? Are the right features at the right price at the right time for them? That's what they care about; it's a very horizontal view.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">But how do we think about work internally? We think about it by job function and whatever is printed on our business cards, which is usually a vertical, functionally aligned view. It's generally human nature to group like with like. Let's put developers with developers, operators with operators, testers with testers, and security with security. Then from there, let's manage those people for their own efficiency inside those groups. What happens is that as soon as you do that, people lose sight of what the customer cares about, which is the end-to-end capability. That's what happens when people optimize, not realizing that they are doing a localized optimization and actually deoptimizing the whole end-to-end system. The problems just fall from there.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Perceptions of quality and its impact on work</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Do you think, then, that those people get incentivized based on the customer's perception of quality?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: Ideally. But do they know what that is? Do they know how their work actually fits in the whole system, and how that impacts this quality? Let's use an example of a siloed firewall team.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">This firewall team might just offer the best firewall rule changes in the Western Hemisphere. Their job is to make sure they make only the best and safest rule changes. They do this by offering limited change windows. If you give them your firewall rule change by Tuesday at 2:00 p.m., then by Thursday at 4:00 p.m., your change will be complete.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Now, imagine I'm a developer and I need a change. I may well be thinking that while I'm not a firewall expert, I'm going to try to figure out what to write on this support ticket. I submit the ticket on Monday, but then it gets kicked back to me on Wednesday because of some problem with my request. I do a few go-arounds with a network admin to figure out how to request what I want, but then it turns out that I've missed the window and have to wait until next Thursday.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">The support team won't do it sooner as it isn't a production service yet, so now I have to wait until the change takes place. The problem there is that you've now got everybody waiting on this firewall rule change because they're working in this disconnected, isolated manner. The optimization for the firewall change rules was made from the firewall team's siloed perspective, not the perspective of the end-to-end system.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Definitely. It's like that quote: if you want to really understand a society, you need to understand its prison system. To me, this translates to the ticketing systems you just mentioned. If you want to see how Agile or Lean a company is, just go to their ticketing system.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: Ha! I've never likened the ticket systems to a prison, but I can see where you are going with that. The destructive tendencies of silos and ticket queues really play an important part in the Rundeck view of the world.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">We noticed back in our consulting days that ticket queues accelerate silo effects, where people lose shared context, start to focus inward, and optimize for their siloed view. In the end, the company suffers, even though everybody looks really busy and their individual areas are highly efficient.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: All of those request queues just add all kinds of economic cost to the company because you're injecting delays; you're adding breaks in context.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: Exactly. We know from other fields that work queues cause delays, quality problems, increased overhead, demoralization, decreased learning, and greater risks. For some reason, IT operations ignore this and act as if ticket-driven request queues are expensive or cause destructive behaviors.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Yet the ticket system has become the way that we run our lives, especially in operations.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: Exactly. I mean, the ticket system was originally called the trouble ticket, because it was supposed to be for when something went wrong. It was there to handle the exceptions. But along the way, it has become the way that we govern work and grant permission for operations to do their work.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">What we've ended up doing is taking organizations who want to be high-velocity learning organizations and dropping ticket-driven request queues all across that value stream. We're taking the queues that are at the epicenter of our existing bottlenecks, delays, bad hand-offs, and knowledge loss and we're spreading them everywhere. It feels like a real industry blind spot.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">A big theme of ours has always been that you've got to design your organization and the underlying work in a way that limits the number of handoffs. You must get rid of the need to hand off work to other teams as much as possible, and doing that often means driving more toward cross-functional teams. However, the cross-functional team idea has its limits, and there are situations where you just can't get rid of those handoffs.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">This is especially true in operations. We're not going to be able to have enough of those people from that great firewall rule-changing team to put one on every team, we're not going to have enough security people, and we're not going to have enough systems engineers, database administrators (DBAs), or storage experts. If that's the case, then we're going to have to take what they do and turn them into pull-based, self-service interfaces. This means that other teams, when they need those operational activities, will have a self-service interface, whether it be a GUI, API, or command line, to do what they need to do, get fast feedback from the system, and move on.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: You mean, for example, getting a virtual machine when you need one?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: Yes, that would be a low-level example. I shouldn't need to open a ticket for somebody to go do it for me, because I have an API or a web button and I can get what I want, and it builds from there. How do you let environment teams do schema updates without a DBA ticket? How do you let developers do their own restarts or health checks in production? How do you let business analysts run their own catalog update procedures?</p>
			<p class="normal indent">The key idea is that self-service operations can't only be the ability to push the button to run something. The people who would want to push the button are going to need the ability to define their own buttons, just like in Amazon EC2 where you can define your own Amazon Machine Images. EC2 would've been useless if they told you the five types of instances that you can spin up and that was it. Let people define their own procedures, and they can still have security and operations do code reviews on those buttons.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">In the EC2 example, they make it useful because they give you the framework and guardrails that allow you to take charge and be useful. The self-service model is not just the ability to push the button, but is also the ability of those teams to define the button; it's a strong design pattern.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">The best definition of DevOps</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: This question is going to sound silly, but I like it because everybody gives me a different answer. We've already mentioned it countless times throughout our discussion, but what is DevOps?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: The best definition that I've heard is from Adam Jacob. He says that DevOps is a cultural and professional movement, focused on how we build and operate high-velocity organizations, born from the experience of its practitioners.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer145">
					<p class="qt">"DevOps is a cultural and professional movement, focused on how we build and operate high-velocity organizations, born from the experience of its practitioners."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Adam Jacob (quoted by Damon Edwards)</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent">I think that's as good as any description because I think it captures the essence of the DevOps movement. DevOps really is an umbrella over a bunch of evolving problems and solutions, all based on the idea of creating higher-velocity and higher-quality organizations. Trying to make it a more detailed description than that loses the point because DevOps is a movement, not a static thing.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I think people who try to make it more specific than that are inventing something that was never really there. That's fine, they can try to do that, and perhaps they'll bring something new to the movement, and everyone will benefit. But they shouldn't complain if the movement ignores them. I think it was Charity Majors who I first heard describe DevOps as an open source movement; the community goes where the community goes.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: That's a great definition.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: It works for a lot of people and keeps them focused on what matters: improving how technology organizations work and the lives of the people inside those organizations. Definition battles in DevOps are useless.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: What do you think about the commercialization of DevOps? When I go to conferences, there's no software anymore that doesn't have a DevOps sticker attached to it.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: I have mixed feelings about it, because at first, I was more of a purist and declared that it just doesn't make sense to label everything as DevOps. It's like saying a person is Agile or that a robot was going to make a factory Lean. But over time, I've softened my stance—partially because I've realized that the market eventually decides that those tools are just slapping the DevOps label on the box, only to get found out. I've also realized that it at least signifies at the macro level that the industry needs to change how it works because if even the tools vendors are talking about it, then a lot more executives will listen.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Aren't most of these vendors making the claim that DevOps is all about deployment?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: A lot of vendors are pushing that narrative because that is what they sell. It's not all of them, but there are many that do. That's probably the one negative of the tools-vendors jumping into DevOps; it plays into the urge for enterprises to just apply a fresh coat of DevOps paint to their old processes. If DevOps is just deployment, then we can just make it an engineering project and not worry about dealing with those messy things called people.</p>

			<p class="normal indent end">This also plays into how large companies like to solve problems. The higher you get in the food chain, especially in large companies, the more transactional management becomes. They'll say, "Tell me the problem. Tell me what check I need to sign and tell me what I get out of it. I'll weigh that against the other checks and sign the ones I think are the right ones." Tools fit into that model well, and the vendors know that. To be fair, I'm a software vendor, and I know that. However, we think that the tools-vendors who last are the ones who actually solve problems and are clear about what problems they can and can't solve. "Buy my tool, and I'll solve your DevOps problems" isn't possible unless you frame DevOps into very narrow and largely unhelpful terms. We didn't all get dressed up to just move some software bits around faster.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: To me, that sounds like the reverse of Scrum. People jumped into the Scrum way thinking that changing people's human processes will solve the problem, and now we have the reverse of that: buy this tool, and it's going to solve your human problem.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: That's a really interesting way to look at it. I think the parallels go even deeper. How many companies "went Scrum" without really changing how they worked? They bought the tools, did some minor training, and then just Scrum-washed their existing Waterfall processes and mindset. Those who did that eventually joined the "Scrum didn't work; it must not be working" backlash. We are going to undoubtedly see the same thing with DevOps, with SRE, and any other movements that come along. It's just how it is.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: That's kind of normal, but perhaps your expectations are too high. Let's say you accomplish 15 percent of something. That's still 15 percent of something.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: That's a fair point. We can lose sight of the net positive. At least people are recognizing that they have problems and they're trying something. My concern is when they use those efforts to declare a premature victory. Actually, nothing has changed, that or they use it as fake proof that it didn't work.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: There are always people like that, which reminds me that a long time ago when one of the QA managers came to me, and I was pushing for automation, they said, "I've found the test case that is not automatable. This is all kind of worthless." But to me I'm like, "You've found one, so what?"</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Damon</strong><strong class="bold"> Edwards</strong>: Humans are tricky, and changing how humans work is downright hard.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">The industry today</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I heard a theory that a big part of our problem in the industry is that we are carried today by people not appreciating operations. Kind of like, with Agile, suddenly we now have rockstars. The industry is saying, "It's a rockstar developer, that's a rockstar tester, that's a rockstar product owner," but nobody ever mentions operators in any context of a positive prize.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Damon Edwards</strong>: There might be something to that. I'm not sure if it's that certain people get rockstar status, but I'm more concerned with the mistreatment of so many IT workers than I am with the cushy lives of a few.</p>

			<p class="normal indent">You can go to the far-flung corporate technology centers all over the world, really, and there are a lot of people in this business only because it pays better than selling insurance. I mean, that's it. They just want to get through their day, provide for their families, and get to their kids' sporting events on the weekends, and here they are in organizations that are highly dysfunctional doing what is often demoralizing, repetitive work. They're burning out left and right because of all the pressure and the conflict that's hoisted upon them.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">That's a lot of human potential that could be put to better use. If we can tap into better ways of working, then that will be good for the individual and great for the company's bottom line. This is why I am so bullish on topics like Lean, DevOps, and SRE; the focus is on how people work and how to make it better.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I think <a id="_idIndexMarker032"/>this is a great place to leave our conversation.</p>
