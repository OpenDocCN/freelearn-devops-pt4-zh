			<h2 class="introHdg"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Introducing Kohsuke Kawaguchi</h2>
			<p class="intro"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>A respected developer and popular speaker, Kohsuke Kawaguchi is perhaps best known for creating Jenkins, a CI platform that has become a widely adopted and successful community-driven open source project. Kohsuke's principles behind the Jenkins community—extensibility, inclusiveness, and low barriers to participation—are many of the driving factors in DevOps. You can follow him on Twitter at <code class="inline">@kohsukekawa</code>.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Before we delve into our conversation about DevOps, could you tell us a little about yourself?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Kohsuke Kawaguchi</strong>: I'm probably best known as the creator of the Jenkins project, which started at the CI server, and is now more broadly used in the general computational industry and automation. Currently, I'm the CTO of CloudBees, a company that's involved in a number of things, among which is productizing Jenkins, and helping companies through their digital transformation.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">What is DevOps?</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: So then, a simple question for you: what is DevOps?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</strong>: If I'm totally honest, I feel like DevOps is a bit of an overused word today. In fact, even I sometimes wonder what people really mean by it. What DevOps is truly depends on several factors. I personally associate DevOps with this growing trend of, over the last few decades, more automation and shorter and shorter feedback cycles.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent end">In the last five years, this automation feedback cycle has become all-encompassing in everything from writing code to managing Quality Assurance (QA) in order to push it out to production and run it. I think people generally default to practices like that and then call it DevOps. When I talk to these people working in the larger enterprises, I think they immediately see DevOps as erasing the organizational boundaries that are in place, which I think is obviously an important problem for them. I know some people like to emphasize that point and make it more of an organizational thing.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">The DevOps toolkit and its organizational impact</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Moving on to the DevOps toolkit, what tools do you see as empowering workers? Do you think that some tools fit better than others into whatever definition of DevOps people have?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</strong>: In the context of broader automation that goes across a number of different things and this ever-expanding need for automation with human control, the tool is obviously the primary means of enabling automation. I know a lot of Jenkins users see the world that way.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Software developers like myself enjoy inventing tools. That's what we do. So, given that world view, it's only natural that we come up with our own tools to bridge those gaps and expand automation even more, because without automation, you can't create shorter feedback cycles, which is a critical part of DevOps. For me, this is the interesting part. It feels closer to what we can solve, as opposed to the organizational structure problem in enterprises, which is not only dictated by those technical concerns, but lots of other factors. For example, there's a good compliance reason why development and operations are separate; it's because it's seen, historically, as a well-maintained compliance necessity. Fundamentally, it's not a technology fight.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: You're the creator of Jenkins, one of the most popular open source tools out there, and you're also the CTO of a company that, as you said yourself, works with enterprise companies. Do you think that there is a significant difference between how the tools and processes operate on smaller greenfield open source-type companies versus those found in enterprises?</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer153">
					<p class="qt">"There's a good compliance reason why development and operations are separate; it's because it's seen, historically, as a well-maintained compliance necessity. Fundamentally, it's not a technology fight."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Kohsuke Kawaguchi</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</strong>: The kinds of problems and challenges that the enterprise people need to deal with are just in a different layer from the smaller guys. For the smaller folks, time is money. As I said before, these smaller operations often don't have too many people on staff to begin with, so they have a lot more flexibility in choosing how they work.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Compliance is usually not as real; it doesn't mean you can ignore it, but you can fly under the radar. In other enterprises, when provisioning new employees, the segregation you have to think about is like optimizing for a global, not just a local, team. It's no wonder one group feels the other group is a bit of an idiot. They each have different challenges.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: As an example, when I go to different booths at DockerCon, it's "DevOps, DevOps, DevOps." All of the software vendors have some form of DevOps associated with them now. What do you think is driving that?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</strong>: I want to say two things.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">First, if I look at the decade-long march toward more automation that I talked about, then we're talking about more than just DevOps. It now includes infrastructure, services, VMs, or software-defined networks. In this broad trend, you can include a practice such as continuous integration, which, at this point, is about 10 years old. Today, DevOps is used as the go-to label for this march. I think this march will continue, but at some point, it'll take on a different name.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Second, we, the engineers, might roll our eyes at the fact that everyone is saying DevOps and twisting its meaning to whatever fits their agenda, but we also underestimate the importance of communicating this stuff in a way that a broader audience understands, which is very difficult to do.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">In order to achieve changes that we know are necessary, as engineers, you have to rally your organization, which means communicating with people who are not engineers. Terms such as "DevOps" are rather useful ways of capturing the ideas, and when a lot of people say the same thing in different ways, it puts some weight behind the credibility of the idea. In a way, therefore, all of these vendors saying "DevOps" are doing us a favor.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I've heard a lot lately about those organizational changes where they're moving everything to the left. What do you think about that? I mean, tools to me are obvious, in that you pick a tool that does the job; you learn how to use it and implement it. In your view, what are the other changes that need to be applied?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</strong>: Yeah, there are obviously things at the technology level as you say, and then there's other challenges. One example I can give you is that the infrastructure around the Jenkins product itself has only a somewhat limited capacity, so when we wanted to shift more QA to the left, we could only do so much. In other words, it takes money, and that's a hard thing to come by in an open source project.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Then, there's a challenge fundamental to QA. QA is actually a never-ending challenge to automate most things, and it's not easy. I used to work on a compiler, and so I used to think naively that testing was super easy—that it's actually completely deterministic. I have an input, I run it through the program, and I get output. I then compare that with what the output should be and then I'm done. But most of the interesting apps that people are writing are very difficult to actually measure out in this way.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer154">
					<p class="qt">"QA is actually a never-ending challenge to automate most things."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Kohsuke Kawaguchi</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent end">Once, I went to a car manufacturer where they had this tower full of headlights. They were testing a little microcontroller that controlled the headlights. Imagine the challenge of mounting them up on a tower, verifying that a light actually turned on, resetting the hardware, and so on. All of that is work. Just on the technology front, there are still tremendous challenges like that. Every time we want to do more QA, there's a never-ending list of problems like this that need to be tackled.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Not to mention those organizational challenges if you're in those companies.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</strong>: Exactly! You have those people in different groups, and you are used to operating in certain ways, and your left-shifting happens at a different pace and at different parts of the project. If you think about somebody who is working on an operations team and is interfacing 100 different operations teams, and only one wants to do things differently, the reaction is, "Look, I can't accommodate things just for you."</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Those things can always be challenging. I'll give you another example of faster delivery creating a friction downstream. The marketing team: the things they do, such as running marketing campaigns or events, are more compatible with big releases. You don't want to issue a press release just for one feature, right? Same thing with the customer-facing guys. They don't want to bombard customers with communication. You want to batch things up. As engineering work becomes more continuous, those people also need to change the way they work. That's nothing new; it's not as if I made this amazing discovery that nobody else knew before. It's easier said than done.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">The hype around containers</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Speaking of technology, all the hype over the last couple of years has been about containers. How do you see that fitting into this whole picture?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</strong>: When I worked at Sun Microsystems, we had our own operating system there called Solaris. I remember an internal conference where they talked about this thing called Solaris Zones. They would say, "Oh, we can split the user space into different portions, and we can allocate different CPU sizes, RAM, and so on to them. They will be like a different set of computers with virtually zero overhead." So now, looking back, I can see that what they were doing was actually putting in place the building blocks of what became containers.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">The Solaris guys must have designed this feature, fully aware of the impact it can create. But it had zero traction. There were a number of other similar examples. The thing that I took away from Solaris is that we, as open source engineers, often tend to think that if you just put the code out there and explain what it does, then other like-minded developers are able to look at it and get the same perspective as yours and then be able to use it. It turns out that's completely not true, and that's something I didn't appreciate before.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">The Solaris guys put all of the nuts, bolts, and engines together to do this new hard thing of isolations and they expected the rest of us to grok the point of it, and we didn't. It took this certain packaging and positioning for the mainstream to really see the value of it, so that was, for me, an interesting history lesson.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: But what are your views on containers? That's obviously a key part of everything that we do in this field.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</strong>: Obviously, I think containers are great. I just can't believe we still have to actually say they're a good thing, but this landscape is moving very rapidly. I remember going to one of the DockerCon conferences and feeling like these guys are going to be the next VMware, as they will own the corporations and the large enterprises that are going to deploy containers in the hundreds of thousands. Yet, within just a few years, what we have discovered is the interest in layers moved up. Containers are considered a good thing, but now it's only as exciting as Unicode. Everyone uses it and nobody cares.</p>

					<p class="qt">—Kohsuke Kawaguchi</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent">I was shocked at the pace of the amazing work in this space. Right now, I think that Kubernetes is all the rage. But, on the horizon, if you look at what Amazon is trying to do, they are essentially hiding Kubernetes almost like an implementation detail.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">As soon as something dominates one layer, that dominance immediately moves the conversation upstack. Now, people will be talking about all of the higher-level values, integrating those, and how to hide them behind. Unicode and TCP—it's all the same. I think this is already happening with Kubernetes. That's what I mean by "boring."</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: The point of good technology is that if it becomes boring, but everybody still uses it, then it's accomplishing its mission.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</strong>: I think that's the ultimate hall of fame for engineers—achieving "good technology" that's become so boring nobody talks about it. I live in San Jose, so I occasionally cross the Golden Gate Bridge, which is a magnificent piece of engineering. I have no idea who built it, but I'm sure that a lot of hard engineering work went into it. Most people don't pause to think about the work involved, even though they benefit from it.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Sometimes, I feel that the world should recognize these people's work more, but then I also think these people probably don't need the validation from the whole world. I bet they know they've done a great work.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Conferences, open source, and the US versus China</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Right now, you're the CTO of CloudBees, where you're in charge of technology. I'm curious; how do you follow up with all of that? I'm asking this simply because I don't know how to do it myself. Every time I visit a conference, I have the impression that I need another year just to learn what each of those programs does.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</strong>: I wish I knew the answer. I, too, struggle with keeping up with what's going on. I find it useful to go to conferences because people there are trying to explain things to you, as opposed to expecting you to grok things on your own. At the same time, in the grand scheme of things, people like you and I are probably good at making sense of the rough bits out there, so from that perspective, going to conferences is a bit of a waste of time because we'd probably learn a lot more on our own in the same amount of time it takes to travel. Also, when you are a producer of a technology, conferences are great ways to hear from people who are using the product. It's always worthwhile to listen to them.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Another reason I go to conferences is that I personally can't watch a recorded video. I just can't keep my attention for anything longer than a minute. I start watching a YouTube video and then within 15 seconds I start multitasking, and then, next thing you know, I completely lose track of what the video is saying. If I could fix that about myself, I'd be a lot more efficient in ingesting information.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I also think there's some truth in the idea of "tested by time." If I continue to hear about something for a long period of time, then it's probably worth paying attention. It's the same with "word of mouth." If people you trust are excited about something, it's probably worth paying attention, too. I think, realistically, those are the only ways that normal people can use to filter signal from noise.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I don't know how they manage, and maybe they don't. What's your feeling about open source? When you started your career, it wasn't a thing, but now it is. Is there still a future in projects that are closed source from the start?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</strong>: Before we go into that, I just need to correct you. Open source has been around for a good amount of time, long before I started Jenkins. I think it still demonstrates my previous point about finding more viable ways to socialize DevOps. I really do believe that, fundamentally, open source is a better way of developing software. I've seen first-hand a number of proprietary software defeated by open source. We've talked about Sun and Solaris, so there's my case.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">When I think about what made open source so successful, I think a key is that open source allowed new ideas from anywhere to be tested out more rapidly and thus quickly converging into a better working solution. Innovations happen everywhere, and that was a key differentiator.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">But I feel, nowadays, there's another emerging differentiator in the different axis, which is the scale of the problem that they are dealing with.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Can you clarify that a bit?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</strong>: I've spent a good chunk of my professional career in Japan. In the worldwide software development market, Japan has about 10 to 15 percent share, so it's no small chunk, but it's not a majority either. Because of the various challenges related to language and time zone, Japanese software companies are by and large only solving the problems for their domestic market. It's a closed market.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Japan has around 100 million people. If you're running a service and you're serving the entirety of Japan, your scaling challenge is capped at 100 million. I attended developer conferences in China and what I realized is that even though their domestic market is just as closed, it is far bigger. So, their biggest service companies are facing and solving the kinds of scaling problems that Japanese companies haven't even thought of.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">I was quite impressed that China was talking about how they need machine learning to help our operations. In Japan, that's a science fiction problem, whereas in China, that's a real problem today. The only other market in the world that rivals that is the United States. So, I'm convinced that our technology landscape in the next decade will be a duopoly between the US and China.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Because of the scale, when a new problem first gets discovered in those markets, they get solved, and they become available to the rest of the world, so the rest of the world doesn't get to really innovate.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer156">
					<p class="qt">"I was quite impressed that China was talking about how they need machine learning to help our operations. In Japan, that's a science fiction problem, whereas in China, that's a real problem today."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Kohsuke Kawaguchi</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent end">What I'm trying to say is that the exposure to challenges at the frontier is becoming as big a differentiator as open source, if not more. I said innovations used to happen everywhere, but I feel innovations are happening closer to challenges of large markets. People say end user companies are now the source of innovations, not vendors, and I think this is for the same reason. So that's something of a prospect that I try to keep in mind.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">DevOps in the next ten years</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Where do you see DevOps going in the next ten years?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</strong>: I wish I had a better sense of the future to say interesting things about it. Like I've been saying, I would say the obvious direction is more automation.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">There will be more demand for software and technology all over the world. For example, every time I have to go through the airport and show my driver's license to authenticate myself to the system, I think, this should be a solvable problem. So, yeah, there will be more software, and there will be more automation.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I guess I just can't get away from automation! Beyond that, I think data and machine learning should play a central role in the way we develop software as well. Those technologies have been disrupting so many things, it's silly to think our own profession is immune from that. But I don't know how quickly those things will happen. If I had that magic 8-ball, I'd be working on it and not talking to you now.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer157">
					<p class="qt">"There will be more software, and there will be more automation."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Kohsuke Kawaguchi</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: You've mentioned automation a couple of times. When I visit companies, there's always a huge number of people doing repetitive manual tasks over and over again. I was even involved in conversations where people are questioning automation, which completely doesn't make sense to me. What's not to like about automation? Why aren't we automated already?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</strong>: Yeah, that's funny. The truth is sometimes I feel the same way. I feel like, as the outsider, we're landing into some places, and we do sometimes underestimate the rationality of the status quo. There's always more to it than what meets the eyes—consideration for things I don't understand, nuances that I don't get, the context, those sorts of things. I don't think it hurts for us to be a little humbler to those things. I'm not surprised if my parents think that our work is completely automatable. You go to the office, you sit in front of a computer, and then you come back. You seem to be repeating that every single day. What's not automatable about that?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Exactly.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</strong>: We need to be careful because we might be falling into that trap ourselves when we look at other people. That is not to say nobody is doing repetitive manual tasks that should be replaced. I'm sure there are some people who resist changes and what not. But my first reaction is always to assume that they see something I don't. So, I don't know. Personally, I don't come across people who genuinely perform this repetitive work. Most of the time, I think people see their work as not overly repetitive.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">The other interesting perspective is, if you think of Japan, they've got traditional cultural things such as the tea ceremony, kendo, or judo. These are art forms, where they emphasize repetition, following the certain <em class="italics">kata</em> and repeating the same tasks to perfection. You start by mimicking a master, then you slowly develop your own style. What might look like circling in the same place to untrained eyes is actually a spiral movement upwards. What's implicit is the respect to the wisdom that your predecessors have built. There's also something deeply satisfying about the feeling of "this time I did it better than the last time." I think it's a key to motivate oneself for a long run. I think those are beautiful, though maybe it's just a part of the Asian psyche.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: As we start to wrap up, I would love to know, is there anything that really excites you in the industry right now?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</strong>: As technology people, we're always excited to play with new toys. So, I guess playing with these new tools and new services is one thing that really excites me. Yesterday, I was playing with Google's new text-to-speech engine, which was pretty good. It's a kind of a black magic, and that's cool, then I think about all of the things that we could do with that, such as an audiobook, voice navigation while driving, or whatever. You just never know what comes out of it. New technology is always fun like that.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">I do enjoy playing with these toys, but at the same time, some mundane problems also excite me. I go and see larger companies struggling with the problem of deploying their large hairy software quickly. Everyone has this problem of tests not being very reliable, or that they have too many tests and, most of the time, they are not doing anything useful. They are starting to question whether running all these tests is actually useful. I'm interested in seeing whether we can intelligently pick the subset of tests to run in the right order. I have a feeling that we can reduce the average turnaround time by an order of magnitude.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Another example of a mundane problem is the way that we track bugs, do the code change and then we get that verified. It's something that happens everywhere, and it's held together by people manually communicating and collaborating. I feel like some of them are ready for automation.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">The connection between cross-stitching, Lego, and DevOps</h2>
			<p class="normal indent end">I guess one person's mundane problem is somebody else's exciting challenge. Aside from that, cross-stitching.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Cross-stitching? What exactly do you mean by that?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</strong>: Cross-stitching is needlework. I started doing this because my wife picked it up and I thought it would be good to have a common hobby with her. It's generally an old woman's hobby. Let me explain cross-stitching in a way that geeks understand. Imagine a screen, and there are the pixels. Each pixel can be a different color. That's how we build graphics. Cross-stitching is the exact same thing; it's just on the piece of cloth, instead of a screen, and instead of pixels, you're using colored threads. It's just the analog version of a video screen. So, I stitch some video game characters and so on for fun.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Now, obviously, the actual stitching is incredibly manual and repetitive. I feel like I should be able to automate this. If there's a programmable machine, as in a sewing machine, I want to see whether I can control it to do the right things. A machine that takes a JPEG or a PNG as an input, then it would cross-stitch things for me. I think that'd be awesome. That would allow me to say, I master everything about cross-stitching, and then I can move on to another hobby. I wish I could do something like that. I have never been able to find anybody in the cross-stitching community who has any passion for this kind of automation. Most fans of cross-stitching are there for enjoying conversations with others while they are stitching things, and so for them, the idea of automation is horrifying. They would say, what's the point of doing it? That's why I'm itching to find a venue in which to talk about it.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">If I get to do that, Lego will probably be the next.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Lego and DevOps? That's a conversation that I wasn't expecting to have with you.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</strong>: I'm a big Lego fan, and among the Lego community, you can have a never-ending conversation about how to sort and store your Lego blocks. You build something, and then you disassemble the model you've built. Most of you put Lego pieces in a big packet when you were small, and then you grow out of Lego and move on to something else. But for the rest of us who never grew out of Lego, and who continue to buy more and more Lego sets, the pieces get too many to just fit in the one packet. It'll take forever to find pieces you want.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I have several drawers full of Lego blocks, and as I was sorting them, naturally I started to think, "Wow, there's so many pieces, I need to automate this." People are actually doing that sort of thing. So, they build the machine, not just the software. It has a webcam that takes a picture of a brick on a conveyer belt, it matches the shape against a catalog, and then some sort of nozzle blows the air to push the piece into the right bin. That kind of automation is really fun, but then again, I just find myself trying to automate everything and anything possible. It's just how I am wired. I don't know if every other software developer feels the same. This story has no conclusion, but that's what excites me.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I have the impression there's a fear that if you do those things, then you're automating yourself out of a guaranteed job position.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</strong>: Wouldn't that be perfect? Because now I can die since I've completely automated myself! Of course, we know there's really no such thing as fully automating yourself away on anything, not even cross-stitching. I mean, what software development teaches us is that if you solve one problem by automation, you then get to face the next problem, and this ladder never ends. That's kind of fun for me.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Take cross-stitching, for example, if I someday manage to produce an ultimate cross-stitching machine like I described, the next thing I'll start thinking about is probably how do I automate the management of my inventory of threads. At that point, I can stitch any design, so I'm pretty sure I will be using threads like crazy, at an unimaginable scale. Today, it takes a trip to a local store to get threads of the right color, which can take several days. That's okay when a stitching project is taking months, but not if it only takes 15 minutes. So, how do you optimize that?</p>

			<p class="normal indent end">Or think about all the secondary problems that the Minecraft people get hang up on. I had a mod that can create a programmable robot inside a Minecraft world, so I could program it to do mining or building. Once you automate the <a id="_idIndexMarker033"/>mining part, then great, but we have this almost infinite inventory of raw iron ore, and then you start to think, "Oh, now I need to automate the smelting part. Otherwise, I'm smelting this forever," and so you kind of keep going like that.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: That's the freakiest story I've heard.</p>
