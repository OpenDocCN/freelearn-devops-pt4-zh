			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I want to start by simply asking you to say a little bit about yourself, Nirmal, and your relationship with DevOps.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: Throughout my career I've had the opportunity to see many organizations follow IT transformation paths, and through those experiences, I've seen what works and what doesn't in our industry. I strive to distribute knowledge around emerging technologies, methodologies, and solutions—especially through DevOps!</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: So Nirmal, what does "DevOps" mean to you?</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">The meaning of DevOps</h2>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: DevOps is the application of process improvement techniques from the last century to our modern IT culture. <a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>If I had to offer a fuller definition, I'd say that DevOps is an IT operating model that focuses on using tools and cultural change to streamline and automate the delivery of IT services. It's modeled after optimized manufacturing models from the last century by the likes of W. Edwards Deming.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">More simply, DevOps is transforming the culture of an organization into a mindset of achieving a shared goal, versus the tribes that are traditionally set up in an organization.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Thanks, Nirmal, it's interesting to see how everyone has such different ways to define DevOps. So, what do you think is the difference between DevOps and Agile?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: I think the twelve principles of Agile are guidelines. More importantly, I don't think Agile was meant to be commercialized and taken over as it has been to the extent we see today. I think the organizations that are adopting Agile have been overthinking it a little.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">DevOps, on the other hand, is Agile applied across the whole organization, rather than just its developer process. Perhaps my distinction is merely semantic, but <a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>broadly speaking you could say that DevOps encompasses Agile methodologies. DevOps is like a superset.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Yes, I think DevOps is like inviting more expertise to an organization, or even more automation. This can open new positions in an organization, of course—and sometimes I see an absurd number of DevOps engineers in an organization. I honestly don't even know what one of these is—how would you define a DevOps engineer?</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">What is a DevOps engineer?</h2>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: This is where it gets controversial because there's no such thing as a DevOps engineer. There shouldn't even be a DevOps team because to me, it's more of a cultural and philosophical methodology. It's a process and a way of thinking about things and communicating within an IT organization.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer186">
					<p class="qt">"There's no such thing as a DevOps engineer. There shouldn't even be a DevOps team because to me, it's more of a cultural and philosophical methodology."</p>
					<p class="qt">— Nirmal Mehta</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent end">But going back to a definition, I think that a DevOps engineer is a job that signals that an organization, instead of hiring both a developer and an operator, just wants one less person to do twice as much work.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I love that description. Even though no one but you will admit it, that's often how it is in reality. You can tell just by looking at advertised job descriptions for DevOps engineer roles.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: I think organizations just want somebody who is willing to both build and operate the software. These DevOps engineer roles are all over the place, but there just isn't a single accepted definition for what a DevOps engineer is.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">The reason is that DevOps engineers are really engaged in two distinct things: tools and culture. I believe that DevOps is mostly about culture, but there are also some tools involved in the DevOps process that will naturally tilt your organization toward more DevOps practices. A DevOps engineer could then be defined as a person who is implementing those tools and some of those philosophies.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Of course, simply installing some tools won't mean that an organization is automatically DevOps—you can misuse a tool regardless of how much magic is in it. So, it's important to also say that a DevOps engineer is more like a consulting role than someone who simply operates those toolsets and keeps those tools running.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Usually, organizations just want someone to come in and implement those tools. And then eventually they're asked to just be a developer who also operates stuff.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Yes, I often see cases when existing teams simply get renamed. They continue performing the same set of tasks using the same processes and tools but under a more popular name.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: I was once on a project where they required a separate DevOps team, which to me didn't make any sense at all. The DevOps team was on a separate contract, so they didn't even work for the organization. So, this project had developers, a security team, operators, and a DevOps team.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Now, you tell me, what was that DevOps team supposed to do? Their only job was on the last step before deployment to production. That DevOps team didn't do anything except handle the sign off before the code went into production. That was not a DevOps team. They were just a random team, a random authority, that didn't have a purpose.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: That makes me think about sysadmins being renamed DevOps.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: Yes, that DevOps team was essentially a neutered quality assurance team that was renamed DevOps because it sounded sexy.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">There is still a lot of whitewashing in terms of DevOps today. As I've said in one of my talks, if you've spent more than a month trying to figure out your organization's DevOps, or you've already spent 15 meetings trying to figure out what your DevOps is, then you're overthinking it.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer187">
					<p class="qt">"If you've spent more than a month trying to figure out your organization's DevOps…then you're overthinking it."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Nirmal Mehta</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent">Not everything has to be complex! It's up to you how much complexity you want to put into the mix at any given time. Take a good look at your organization, pick some pain points, and just go from there. Reading some books and implementing one or two parts of those processes is probably a better start than debating what DevOps is for a month, which is something we love to do in IT. We love to just argue about stuff but get nothing done.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">We like to be in our tribes, we like to shed responsibility, and we have this need for argument and for some oppositional force, and I think DevOps and Agile help to redefine who that opponent is. Instead of friction between internal groups, DevOps directs our confrontational energy toward the problem that we're trying to solve for our customer. DevOps brings us into conflict with the actual problem, rather than with each other.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: But then we end up with consultants selling us month-long training that is supposed to convert us into Agile experts?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: True, and that's something I can get very philosophical about: why do we have to have so much training for Agile? I think all that training is contrary to the goal of Agile in the first place! We find ourselves enveloped in the minutiae of all that complexity and we forget the core principles of Agile.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I think that's why the Agile people came up with the manifesto, to force us to print it out and put it on a wall. They knew that if we weren't reminded about the whole point of Agile, then we'd forget what we're really trying to achieve.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: That sounds like a misunderstanding and over-complication of Agile, which is in its essence, very simple.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Overthinking DevOps</h2>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: As an industry we love to overthink everything, and I think that DevOps has the same kind of issues.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">DevOps is very simple. DevOps is the application of techniques for process improvements that some start-ups, well-functioning organizations, and smart people implemented. These were shown to other people who said, "Yes, that sounds great; that's helping us be more efficient, reduce cost, or make better quality and, you know what, we might as well adopt it!"</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent">Let's not overcomplicate DevOps. When it's time to lose weight, simply put more calories out than you put in. That is the simple fact. Don't be distracted by complex diets because you want an easy way out. It's the same with DevOps, the philosophy is simple: get out of your own way.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">The DevOps philosophy – get out of your own way</h2>
			<p class="normal indent"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>The DevOps philosophy is to get out of your own way. But this is too hard, of course, so we try to find a shortcut. This shortcut might be a tool, a consultant, some YouTube videos, or a book. At the end of the day though, we cannot get away from having to follow the philosophy. We can implement Jenkins all day, but we won't achieve anything unless we also follow the philosophy.</p>

					<p class="qt">"The DevOps philosophy is to get out of your own way. But this is too hard, of course, so we try to find a shortcut."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Nirmal Mehta</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent">This is the fundamental shift that's taking place today in organizations—it's a realization that actual, productive change must be a little bit more painful. This is a deep cultural shift, and we must deal with people, their attitudes, and all that—including people who just don't want to change.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">There's a lot of misinformation about what DevOps is in our industry today, and that is because no one wants to hear that it's all about simple but important truths like "more calories out," and a lot of people don't want to face change. Do you think organizations such as Facebook and Google are having those kinds of debates?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I expect that Google and Facebook are having some important debates, right now, that the rest of us will have in fifteen years, about machine learning and neural networks. But Google has also been discussing SRE, for example?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: Yes, organizations such as Google have been taking some of the most recent debates and codifying them into service level agreements and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) philosophies. There's no escaping the pain.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">DevOps and SRE</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Let's explore how the Google SRE thing relates to DevOps then. How do you define an SRE?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: A site reliability engineer is an IT operations engineer who supports development teams and production systems based on Google DevOps methodologies.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">One of the big things to come out of the SRE philosophies is that there's a risk associated with the budget of how many hours the SRE team gives their project team for fixing whatever happens.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">You can deploy as risky a piece of software as you want, but if you burn through that budget, that's on you. If you're providing a service that isn't as critical, you have a higher budget, and so you can take more risk. Or you could say, "You know what, I need to save that up for certain times of the year, or certain events, and balance that out."</p>
			<p class="normal indent">This approach in Google's DevOps methodology removes the ability to skirt around the pain because it puts the pain at the front and center.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Resolving key pain points is something that a lot of organizations have difficulty with, and it's a very common problem with Agile. For example, if you're transitioning from Waterfall to Agile, then the project managers, leaders, and owners will all want Agile—but Agile with deadlines!</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: You're saying that managers want others to adopt Agile, but they don't always want to adapt their own way of working?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: Yes, exactly, those people want Agile with deadlines because deadlines allow someone to put the blame somewhere else.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Deadlines are an escape route, whereas Agile just forces you to think about implementing at a more regular pace, or with prioritization, and to make decisions more frequently.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Not one person in leadership likes to make decisions at the frequency that Agile requires because decisions mean responsibility. And a lot of organizations and the folks working within them are masters at the craft of dodging responsibility. Agile forces that discussion at the beginning instead of having discussions about priority after the deadline or closer to the deadline.</p>

					<p class="qt">"Not one person in leadership likes to make decisions at the frequency that Agile requires because decisions mean responsibility."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Nirmal Mehta</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent">DevOps is the same because it forces you to understand how to put your projects into production and to pay for it at the beginning of the cycle. In DevOps, you're trying to catch things at the beginning of the cycle, not the end.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">A lot of problems we face today are because somebody was able to avoid making a decision until the very last minute—that is, when they were forced to make a decision. They probably knew what their decision was going to be, they just didn't have the confidence in that decision until they were forced into an answer.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Agile and DevOps force you to make decisions more frequently, and from the beginning. I think people have a hard time with the confidence that is required or the <em class="italics">okayness</em> with failure that one needs to feel, in order to be able to do that. Ironically, DevOps and Agile will tolerate you making bad decisions more frequently than the older methodologies!</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Make [bad] decisions more often</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Are you saying that organizations and people in IT departments should make bad decisions more often?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: If you're deploying four times a year, then you only have four opportunities to make a decision, and therefore each of those decisions has a big impact. <a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>If you are in Agile, you're making a lot of smaller decisions. If you make a bad decision, you can just correct it at the next deadline, and you've lost very little. That's the irony.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer191">
					<p class="qt">"If you are in Agile, you're making a lot of smaller decisions. If you make a bad decision, you can just correct it at the next deadline, and you've lost very little."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Nirmal Mehta</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent">Of course, it's still painful if you've made a bad decision, but for some reason we humans find it more painful to have to make a decision every two weeks.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I think these kinds of things happen in other industries as well, sometimes when there's even more on the line. In the aeronautics, manufacturing, or construction industries, for example, where when you make a big decision that goes wrong, there's a multi-million dollar consequence. Those kinds of organizations have evolved their own techniques to force incremental decisions to be made.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Over the last couple of years I've seen a huge growth of interest in DevOps at conferences. This interest is often centered around a particular set of themes—immutable infrastructure, containers, and schedulers. Is there a relationship between them that explains so much interest?</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">DevOps patterns</h2>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: Yes, there is a relation between them. And there's a lot of interest around them because they reflect some important patterns that people are starting to adopt right now.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Maybe only ten percent of people out there really know what they're doing in IT today, and they can't be in every organization at once. It's debatable whether anyone <em class="italics">really</em> knows what they're doing, of course, because I bet if you asked those ten percent, they would say, "I don't know what I'm doing!"</p>
			<p class="normal indent">What the ten percent <em class="italics">do</em> know is that when they do <em class="italics">this</em>, they're less stressed out. When they do <em class="italics">this</em>, their website is more reliable. When they do <em class="italics">that</em>, they get one more extra customer every time. So that's how they see it: "If I do this, I get an extra million dollars of investment funding; if I do this, my evaluation goes up; and if I do this, I have not closed the door because I'm still competitive." Those are the only heuristics that we have as an industry.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Now, let's take a person in their IT career, maybe they work on average at between three to six different places, across their peak career time.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Yes, it's difficult to strike a balance between being locked in a single company all your life and never experiencing what's happening outside or just switching companies every few months.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: Yes, so what do we do across our career? Every year we're like, "Hey, that kind of worked, I spent six months doing it, and it worked." What we're trying to do, in DevOps, is gather as many heuristics from each person and somehow distill them down so that one day we say: this is <em class="italics">the</em> winning heuristic.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">For example, Aaron Huslage, who was formerly at Docker and is now at Red Hat Ansible, comes over to me and he says, "Why are you guys patching? Just destroy the server and move the containers to a new patched server. Don't patch retroactively; always move forward." Okay, that's a good idea! That saves me time because now I have one less piece of software that I need to worry about.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I think that all we're doing in DevOps is hunting, hunting, and hunting for these ideas. With each of these ideas, there's an associated cultural change that needs to happen. The cultural change that happens when you adopt these practices is called DevOps.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Are you saying that DevOps only exists in relationship to new ideas and that new ideas need DevOps to manage organizations toward cultural transformation?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: I think DevOps can be there with or without those ideas. I mean you can patch with DevOps. And you can have the traditional operations of DevOps. Just as long as you understand the communication mechanisms involved, and that you're going to have to continuously inspect and understand your processes—and be ready to improve them.</p>
			<p class="normal indent"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>After all, there's no timeline for the adoption of DevOps, and there's no manifesto that says you must achieve greater deployments of your software.</p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent">In my client space, deploying software <em class="italics">faster</em> is not always the real need. And some organizations don't even care about <em class="italics">cost</em>. Across my customer base, it's quite a common situation that if they don't spend the money that they were given this year, they will get less money next year, so they <em class="italics">want</em> to spend more money.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">That doesn't mean DevOps has no application for organizations in those situations: they can still have other things they need from DevOps, such as being more <em class="italics">secure</em> and thus more <em class="italics">reliable</em>.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Reliability is a big topic. At its core, the reliability of services is what drives a lot of the interest you see today in DevOps. Reliability with fewer people is what I think DevOps is. There's a risk that all these things will reduce the need for people like us.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Who do you mean when you say, "people like us"?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: I mean developers and operations. As these services become more SaaS-based, I think greenfield development of new software is going to be much closer to junior-level, pre-canned business object stuff, like Azure or Amazon Web Services, at some point in the future.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: So, you wouldn't bet on the future for developers and operations?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: My gut says that in the future we'll see less bespoke software being developed in the majority of IT organizations. Instead, new software development is going to be in the hardware.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">The only caveat on that is machine learning, which is already blowing up into a whole new world of software development. Programming by combining different deep learning and neural networks together could become a new field of software development, and that might be a transition for a lot of people. Instead of making APIs for web apps all day long, we're going to be just optimizing machine learning, and we'll become much more programmatic. Eventually, eighty percent of services will be filled from four overlord service providers, and that's it.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: To be honest, I would be very scared if I was young and had my career years ahead of me because I think that most people just won't be able to follow the ever-increasing pace.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Those people who are specialized in a single field are at greater risk of becoming obsolete. I mean, what will happen to those who spent years working on infrastructure when companies decide to move to the cloud? Sure, they can apply for a job in AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, but I'm afraid that the bar might be too high for many.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: We've already seen that in the industry; look at how many organizations are moving to Office 365, and how many places have their own Exchange Servers. That number gets smaller and smaller. That was a core role of IT for a long time, managing Active Directory, Exchange, and MS SQL, but those days are in the past.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I guess that it puts companies in a sweet position where they can dedicate most of their resources into something that really brings value to them. When you think about it, does it bring value to a company to manage Exchange?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: No, it doesn't. But what I think is interesting, and this is a kind of a cynical point of view, is that there is so much low-hanging fruit in a lot of these companies!</p>
			<p class="normal indent">This is especially true for companies that have either established themselves in a monopoly or have created a big enough wall through competition or where there's a consolidation of who works or even competes in that field anymore. For such companies, there might not have even been a reward for increasing value. For such companies, there's been no need for perfection. It's not even that they don't need non-buggy code; they just need to get something out there, even if it's just bad.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">The true enemy of DevOps</h2>
			<p class="normal indent">We're talking here about the true enemy of DevOps and Agile. This true enemy is not the benders, it is not the mislabeling of what DevOps is, and it is not all those difficult IT shops. The true enemy of DevOps is when the fundamental balance of everything that we're trying to achieve no longer matters. The true enemy of DevOps is when higher quality stuff doesn't matter—when an organization is just trying to get shit out there.</p>
			<div>

					<p class="qt">"The true enemy of DevOps is when higher quality stuff doesn't matter—when an organization is just trying to get shit out there."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Nirmal Mehta</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent end">A lot of the people I meet at conferences are IT people, and most of them are obviously trying to derive more value, to make their mark, to reduce costs, or to keep their job. But at a certain level in most organizations, if you find a non-IT person, they will probably consider that whatever is there right now is perfectly fine and that they can squeeze that apple for longer.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I think that we have a serious discrepancy in velocity. While we're used to the fact that things often change, and with ever-increasing velocity, the world is still trying to figure out what that means. Non-IT personnel are still not used to the fact that whatever was valid yesterday might be completely different today.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: Yes, they need to just change the color of the website every six months, and they're good to go. And to change the name of the product.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">That's why competition is a good thing because the real enemy of DevOps shows its face in IT organizations where "good enough" is of a lower quality than any of us want to work in.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">In this sense, DevOps is just a way to do a good enough job with two or three fewer people, before an organization transitions to an entirely Software as a Service (SaaS) arrangement. This is the real adversity, and apathy, that DevOps is trying to fight.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Agile is also trying to fight the apathy. Waterfall was all about making decisions at the last minute possible, right before going to production. Agile is forcing those decisions earlier so that you can't be apathetic to whatever. Instead, you have to make that decision today about what you're going to work on and what you want people to work on. Agile is about creating an incentive to make decisions.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">DevOps is very similar in that we're creating an incentive for people and organizations to make decisions about what kind of code they want to deploy or what kind of service they want to deploy.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I think you're right about the role of DevOps, but I also think that decision-making is what many people are trying to avoid. This may be the reason why we have such a huge discrepancy between what we say DevOps is about and how DevOps is really implemented in practice. A critical decision area for many organizations today is security. So, how does DevOps fit into IT security departments?</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">DevOps in security departments</h2>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: I think that IT security is very important, but I also know that we can very easily underestimate how many people don't give a damn about security right now. And that's because, to many people, the problem of security is just the same as the problem of pollution. IT security and climate change are in almost the exact same position from that perspective: there's a negative externality to what happens.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Let me explain. If Equifax, the consumer credit reporting agency, gets hacked, which it did, and all our credit information is breached, but there is no cost associated to Equifax for doing that, then it's the same thing as if I build a power plant and I don't pay the price of the pollution I give out. This is a negative externality that is not associated with the cost, and it's a situation that doesn't fix itself without the government. That's essentially what government is for, to eliminate that tragedy of the commons. I see security as absolutely stuck in a tragedy of the common situation where there is no consequence.</p>

					<p class="qt">"I think that IT security is very important, but I also know that we can very easily underestimate how many people don't give a damn about security right now."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Nirmal Mehta</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent end">If I put 100 dollars into improving my security, and my competitor puts zero dollars to improve their security, and we both get hacked, then we both have no consequences. The only thing I lost is 100 dollars, and my competitor didn't lose 100 dollars. That's the only difference.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: My experience from working with enterprise-based companies is that security always has the last word, but at the same time most don't really understand. Too often, security is about marking some fields in an Excel sheet and not really helping IT teams develop secure applications. Too often, it seems as if the only goal of a security department is to be able to say, "It's not our fault."</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: That's the unfortunate situation we're in, and this is something I would say we faced even before the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities. These kinds of massive security bugs aren't going anywhere, but we do not have the headspace to rationalize how bad the security is. We therefore just bury our heads in the sand as a civilization and as a modern society, when it comes to privacy and IT security. I think that we will absolutely continue to do this unless there are real consequences to the industry, and even then, I don't think change will happen because it would essentially mean killing IT.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Just imagine if developers had to get insurance on the code that they wrote, just like a doctor must get malpractice insurance. If there was a computer or developer engineering malpractice insurance, like this, it would kill the industry overnight. Some developers would buy it if they had the money, but we're already aching for talent and resources now as an industry, and this would eventually eliminate ninety percent of developers in the field.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">On top of that, all those people who we promised could become developers because we destroyed their job with automation must then get insurance against how bad their initial code could be as they switch careers. The whole idea is just not practical unless everything becomes more expensive, and security is not going to be any different.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I'm surprised that I haven't heard this idea about code insurance before. The more I think about it, the more it makes sense. Why would software be any different than anything else that has insurance? We all use it, we all depend on it, and malfunction can result in serious damage or even death. It fits the description of many other things that we take for granted as being insured.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">But, as you say, guaranteeing code quality would ruin a big segment of the industry overnight. We have somehow become used to the fact that software doesn't always work, and that hacking is part of life. There's not a big incentive to make what we create truly secure—at least not everywhere.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: That doesn't mean that a company can't differentiate themselves on their security. It's nice to see companies such as Apple and others where they don't treat us like products.</p>

					<p class="qt">—Nirmal Mehta</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent">Now, when you come to the business-to-business side of security, or the e-commerce side of security, I think the answer is that things will just move to more SaaS-based services.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">When you do have conversations with organizations about moving to the cloud, you start to see how it really is going to make everything more secure. Why? Because the organization is then forced to face reality: they must actually do the security things that they said they were doing, but they're not! Of course, Amazon Cloud is also way more secure than a lot of the places that do it in-house because Amazon has a massive financial incentive that's missing from many government services.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">DevOps has this real opportunity to increase the security incentive that is missing in a lot of organizations. However, good IT security still requires strong leadership.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: What's missing in IT that needs this strong leadership? Is it more money being invested, more education, or better practices? What do we miss in security today? I ask this because in the companies I visit, I continually find partners who will say, "Look, you need to fulfill those 35,000 requirements, and then you're secure." Nobody I know ever manages to fulfill their bulk.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: <a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>There's a couple of different problems here. The first one is that there's no glory in fixing a bug or a security issue, whereas there's always glory in deploying a feature.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">The second thing is that fixing bugs, finding security holes, and doing things the <em class="italics">right</em> way often takes more patience, more thinking, more engineering, more time, and more cost. These are things that most organizations don't even have to begin with. Most organizations don't even have enough money or resources to do what their original goal is with respect to their software. That stuff is way further down on the list.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer197">
					<p class="qt">"There's no glory in fixing a bug or a security issue, whereas there's always glory in deploying a feature."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Nirmal Mehta</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent end">The third thing is experience and understanding. How many people even really understand speculative execution and processors? If you went to those coding boot camps to become a web developer, and you sat there and imported 15,000 npm JavaScript libraries, did they explain to you how a CPU works? No, they didn't.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: And you don't even know what those libraries do.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: Right, and so people who <em class="italics">do</em> understand are expensive and they're few and far between. Their experience and knowledge are not codified in any software suite currently. The security software industry is very far behind in terms of its ability to adapt to more frequent deployments and to bring that whole entire picture together about common bugs and penetration testing.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">And, of course, this all costs an organization more than their competitor who decides not to do any of that. There's still a consequence to maybe losing a customer, but there isn't really a global consequence.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Vi</strong><strong class="bold">ktor Farcic</strong>: That is until it happens.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: Yes. My gut feeling is that a lot of places are less secure than we think and that the insurance model just pays that problem away, instead of them just dealing with it. It's still cheaper to just pay for the problem than it is to pay the 250,000 dollars a year for a security person.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">There are a lot of issues with paying for the problem, and just one of them is that a security person in an organization that's not a top-tier place such as Google, Facebook, or Apple is probably not an expert at all. They've quite likely just done some training and got certifications. Yes, they're probably smart on SQL injections and phishing scams, but they're probably only one member of a small team tasked with that, and they care more about having dinner after work.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">They do have this secret weapon, of course, that no one else in the IT organization has, and that is the ability to say "No" unconditionally.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Thou shalt not pass!</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: It's like a cognitive bias, and it's like a false power… but it's not actually a false power—it's true power! And it's much harder to fight a negative.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Security is not a justice system; you're not innocent until proven guilty. There are good reasons why you're guilty until proven innocent with security, and that's why we have those checklists.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer198">
					<p class="qt">"Security is not a justice system; you're not innocent until proven guilty. There are good reasons why you're guilty until proven innocent with security, and that's why we have those checklists."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Nirmal Mehta</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent end">But this means that both your false positives and false negatives are also going to be through the roof because it's too hard not to say no.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: If I'm guilty until proven innocent then I can't prove myself innocent.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: Exactly, there's no such thing as 100% infallible and bug-free software. We have non-deterministic complex systems, and that's a challenge because everyone wants 0/1, yes/no, but there's no yes/no in a non-deterministic complex system. There is only a percentage of acceptance and probabilities.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">The problem is, security wants to treat everything like yes/no with a certain amount of risk, but everyone needs to treat security more like a probability. At the same time, no one wants to work on the hard thing.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">The hard thing here is writing good software without having to import all these things, and to actually look at all the code, to look at your open source tools that you're using, to validate what you're doing, to implement mutual TLS, to renew your certificates, and to make sure your domain names use two-factor. </p>
			<p class="normal indent">These things are so fundamental to security that it's the same thing as "more calories out than in," but we're all just looking for a shortcut. And the shortcut for the security person is just to say "No, here's a checklist of symptoms."</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">The checklist is just symptoms that have been seen in the past. It's not a cure, and it's not a diagnosis of a system. It's just a symptom checklist. Are you sneezing? No, okay. Are you coughing? No, okay. Do you have a fever? No, okay. Then you're no security risk.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Fighting security threats</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: How do we fight security threats, if we can at all? A single person can do serious damage by exploiting our system vulnerabilities. How many people, if you can even put a number on it, do we need to prevent that person from attacking us?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: That's all we've come up so far with, isn't it: how do we pay for the problem? How many people? That's because everything is reactionary.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">There's more to this problem though. The core of security in IT leverages that same power that allows our modern technology companies to do amazing things with 100 or 1,000 fewer people than ever before. But here's the rub: that ability for technology to so dramatically increase the leverage of a single person also works for the person attacking you.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">It's the same problem we have with terrorism. It costs 500 bucks for someone to become a suicide bomber, but it costs 1.5 trillion dollars to prevent that suicide bombing from happening. The attackers who are attacking your infrastructur<a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>e have the same 1,000x or more advantages that you use to make your company exist.</p>
			<div>

					<p class="qt">—Nirmal Mehta</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent">It's impossible to really secure against this unless you send your stuff to space. So, what does all this mean? It means that you must decide where on the spectrum of 0% to 100% probability of security failure you are comfortable.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">You're still not going to put the equivalent percentage of actual money toward your security risk, because that is a lot costlier than you think it is. There needs to be a balance—some sort of cost/benefit evaluation that puts us in a situation where we gain as much benefit with as little investment.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: What's waiting for us in the next ten years from now?</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Future technologies</h2>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: Part of my job is to look at future technologies, and nowadays I'm doing that for the cloud. At a certain point, it really hit me hard about the cloud.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Let me tell you. It was when I saw a slide at <em class="italics">AWS re:Invent</em>; it was just a bar chart, and on the <em class="italics">x</em>-axis was <em class="italics">2011</em>, <em class="italics">2012</em>, <em class="italics">2013</em>, and <em class="italics">2014</em>—the years; and on the <em class="italics">y</em>-axis, it wasn't new services, but instead it was the year-over-year percentage increase in features that AWS will provide. The first year on that chart, it was 50%. They added another 50%, so the next one was 100%. Then it was 500%. The following one was 1,000%, and after that, it was 4,000%.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">If you're an internal IT organization and you're building services, and you see that graph, and I'm selling the cloud and the ability to use cloud services to compose and build your own applications, how do you resist?</p>
			<p class="normal indent">It's pretty clear to me that Amazon, Azure, and Google are making their way vertically. They want to vertically integrate as much as possible because every time they move up that tier, they get higher value, so commodities and value bump up.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer200">
					<p class="qt">"It's pretty clear to me that Amazon, Azure, and Google are making their way vertically. They want to vertically integrate as much as possible…"</p>
					<p class="qt">—Nirmal Mehta</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent">Now you do that at 4,000% or 5,000% a year, you eventually run out of stuff to develop. Are you telling me there's not going to be a service where you just drag and drop three things onto a screen, and you get a full business application? Of course. That's the inevitability of that graph.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">If that's sustained, and even if it wasn't sustained, even if they went back to 50%, then they just need to add little bits and pieces here and there and do a better job of connecting their existing services together, and there would be no reason to develop your own software. You'd just have your business use case, pick the language and the container format, pick the CICD pipeline, and you'd be done.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">I took some Azure training a year ago, and we had to build a web API that had authentication. It would take a JSON-formatted string, convert it into Chinese, do sentiment analysis, search Twitter, and then provide a machine learning prediction on what the next word would be in that phrase.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">If I had got that challenge five years ago, I would have had to build an architecture with maybe some machine learning. I wouldn't know how even to spin up some EC2 instances. This were pre-containers, but there was no Docker yet, so I would have had to cobble the thing together and spend 99% of my time authenticating web connections and running EC2 instances, just getting that stuff up and running.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">By contrast, we managed to do all this in our training in fifteen minutes. We dragged a box onto this window; we then dragged another box containing Cortana translation services and drew an arrow, so sentiment analysis was done by Cortana. We put the API key in there, and we were good to go. We clicked deploy, and it was a fully load-balanced API, automatically created, with authentication and certificates already all there. We hit it with some JSON and boom. Now we could package that and put it in the marketplace, where we could sell that to you for 1% per API call.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I would need to make a couple of zillion API calls, but at the end of the day that would still be a fraction of what it would cost me to probably never actually succeed in making it myself.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: Exactly, and so it was during that training that I said, "We will probably be consultants and build this stuff for maybe fifteen more years, but there is a point in the future where there will be no more greenfield; it's just going to be business intelligence applications with us composing them on Amazon, Azure, or Google Cloud."</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer201">
					<p class="qt">"We will probably be consultants and build this stuff for maybe fifteen more years, but there is a point in the future where there will be no more greenfield."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Nirmal Mehta</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent">There will be some other service that maybe combines those services together, but at some point, this is going to be completely vertically integrated. In fact, you can already see it in Amazon's video editing tools. They released a bunch of 3D web VR tools, so they're already starting to go against these industries where it would have been impossible to think that this would be done in the cloud, but here you are, and so at a certain point there's no reason not to just to build your own service anymore.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I mean, Lambda allows you to pay by the call, so if you're a start-up you don't even need to run a server anymore, and your costs can become perfectly linear with your customer acquisition.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: The cost as a start-up, right at the beginning, is basically zero because you're very unlikely to reach the limits of what is free in those first few months.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: I predict that this will be the future. There will no longer be a conversation between the business owner and the internal IT team. The business owner will just go right to Azure. Then the business user—not the developer, not an operations guy, and not a security guy, but the business user—is going to have their Azure account.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">The business user is going to be some savvy intern and the business owner is going to say something like, "Okay, I need something to tell me the logistics shipping route of our competitor." To which, the business owner will say, "Okay, boom, here's a geospatial service." The business owner will then add a little bit of a machine learning block, put an API in, click deploy, test it, and that's it. They'll then simply pass a bill to the business owner.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">That's something that scares me, but our DevOps careers will nearly be over when this stuff really takes off. If I was starting my career now, I would just do DevOps with data science and machine learning because if you can collect data and you can learn from it, that's where the real value is today and in the coming years.</p>

					<p class="qt">"If I was starting my career now, I would just do DevOps with data science and machine learning."</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: As you say, it's okay, right? It's like climate change; it won't happen before I retire. Do you have any final remarks?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Nirmal Mehta</strong>: My final remark is that I sometimes overestimate the impetus for change to newer <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>systems, against the inertia of keeping older systems running. I mean, people are okay with really bad stuff in IT for a lot longer than you might think.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">That's my parting thought. We can get excited about containers, CICD, and DevOps itself, but one way or another, at some point in the future, there will be no need for all this.</p>
