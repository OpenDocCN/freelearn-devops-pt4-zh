    with failure that one needs to feel, in order to be able to do that. Ironically,
    DevOps and Agile will tolerate you making bad decisions more frequently than the

    is that a security person in an organization that's not a top-tier place such

    likely just done some training and got certifications. Yes, they're probably smart
    on SQL injections and phishing scams, but they're probably only one member of
    a small team tasked with that, and they care more about having dinner after work.

    was a fully load-balanced API, automatically created, with authentication and
