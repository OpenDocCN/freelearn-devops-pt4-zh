			<p class="intro"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>Wian Vos is an experienced DevOps/cloud consultant with a demonstrated history of working in the information technology and services industry. He is skilled in PaaS, Agile methodologies, DevOps, and cloud technologies. You can follow him on Twitter at <code class="inline">@wianvos</code>.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Hi, Wian! Before we delve into our conversation about DevOps, could you tell us a little about yourself?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: I'm currently a solutions architect at Red Hat, one of the biggest open source companies in the world, based in Amsterdam. I've been doing DevOps since before it was called DevOps, and have been involved in infrastructure automation since 2005, and the containerization push since 2013. Over the course of my career, I've worked at ING Bank, Rabobank, and several other smaller government bureaus here in the Netherlands. More recently, I was a managing consultant for DevOps at CINQ ICT in Zaandam, and before that, I worked in Boston for two years at XebiaLabs.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Defining DevOps</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I want to start with the same question I've asked everyone else in this book: what is DevOps? Everybody has given me a different answer. Personally, I don't know why everyone defines it differently, but hopefully this will be something we touch upon in our discussion.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer220">
					<p class="qt">"DevOps has meant different things at different points in time."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Wian Vos</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: Actually, that's pretty much what I expected. I think DevOps has meant different things at different points in time. When the term was first coined, it was basically a push for a new way of working from the DevOps manifesto, which I thought, back in the day, made sense. But then DevOps got popular, and as with all things that get popular, the big vendors jumped on the bandwagon—my current employer, Red Hat, included—and turned it into a marketing term.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">But what is DevOps to me? DevOps is a paradigm of how to run your IT business culture. If you look at the term in the purest sense of the word, it's a way to put development and operations in a same-team situation, all working toward the same business goal. I've been involved with DevOps for nine years now, and I've never been in one of those mythical teams, nor have I ever seen one of those mythical teams actually work. But what I have done is become associated with DevOps-like practices and DevOps tools. Through my experience, I've found that DevOps is basically all about culture and a way of working.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: So, if you've never seen DevOps working, and I must admit that I've seen it work rarely, if ever, is it because companies fail at it? Or is it because those companies have never actually even tried to incorporate DevOps in the way it should be incorporated?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: If you want to implement DevOps in a company, you face a couple of obstacles. To start with, there are the actual relationships between development and operations. Those aren't a big deal when you're dealing with a new start-up or companies that are implementing brand-new applications. Why? Because you can get a team together, and they can all do their thing.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">But if you look at how traditional companies are basically organized, there's always been this traditional split between development and operations, and it's basically because each has a different vantage point. On the one hand, you have development striving for stability, while on the other, you have operations backed by the business striving for change. Getting those two together in a traditional company, and not in a start-up setting, is going to be hard.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: If that's the case, what are the biggest issues you think companies face when they want to enable DevOps in their organizations?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: I've always considered DevOps companies as ones that are invested in technology from the bottom up. It's not so much about creating one team, but more about teams listening to each other, and technology changes being decided from the bottom up, instead of handed down from the top.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">You asked about the biggest problems companies face today. One of the biggest challenges I've seen with implementing actual DevOps is the moving headcount. Why? Because these teams—development and operations—have already battled each other for years, and now you have managers trying to put these people in one team. The old manager is then replaced by a new manager who has a different approach.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer221">
					<p class="qt">"I've always considered DevOps companies as ones that are invested in technology from the bottom up. It's not so much about creating one team, but more about teams listening to each other."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Wian Vos</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent">What are managers basically for, if not for people who have a headcount? Say I'm a manager who has 20 people and is going to let 10 people go. What am I now? Well, I'm half the manager I used to be. I know it sounds harsh and borderline disrespectful to the managers out there. From a DevOps perspective, I have encountered good managers. But it takes a very open, very peculiar company culture to actually make it work.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I think DevOps is a great catalyst for the enormous open source technological push that we've seen in the past 10 years. But in practice, it's horrible. Well, it's not horrible, it's just undoable.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">What it means to be truly Agile… and the importance of Kubernetes</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Let me ask a follow-up question then. How many companies have you seen that are actually truly Agile?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: I've seen a lot of development teams that are truly Agile. I worked for Xebia for a long enough time to actually know what Agile is, where it was implemented, and what to look for.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">But being truly Agile takes perseverance, which is pretty hard to find these days in the corporate world. It's not just doing two weeks in front of a board with a lot of sticky notes. It's much more than that; it's a mindset. It's not going into that hole of saying, "I want this feature now because I have money." It's more like saying, "Alright, let's plan this, put this on the backlog, and classify it."</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">I haven't seen many, if any, truly Agile companies, but I have seen companies trying to be Agile, and before that, companies trying to be good with Lean—which, in a certain sense, is good, because those companies try to incorporate Agile, and they try to incorporate Lean, which at the end of the day brings something positive to their company culture. But it doesn't necessarily make them Agile, Lean, or DevOps. If you're running an operations shop with ongoing business, Agile is the hardest thing to do.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: So, companies then don't change from a cultural perspective when they're above a certain size?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: That's not what I'm saying. What I'm trying to say is that the technology involved in DevOps is not the problem. The problem is the people, and when it comes to people, they're very hard to change, especially in a corporate culture. But, keep in mind, I have never worked at a start-up, ever. So, I don't have that start-up experience.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I guess start-ups are a different ballgame because they're small and can, in theory, do whatever they want. They've haven't got any baggage to get rid of.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">But that's the problem I have when I'm visiting companies and trying to explain to them the big picture of technologies. Let's take a microservice, for instance. They're the result, like any other technology or process, of a certain culture in a certain environment, and it ends up being a tool.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: Or a process, or a buzzword.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: But then if you don't actually take it all the way or if you just simply adopt the tool, then you're in a very bad place, just like the case with microservices. Can you have microservices without self-sufficient teams? Can you have self-sufficient teams without changing the culture?</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">At least in my experience, it fails miserably. But going back to tools, we've both worked for software vendors, and in my experience, I have the impression that absolutely every single software vendor in the world has now rebranded its tools as being DevOps. At conferences today, it's all DevOps. For me, all the tools that I've used for the last 10 years are DevOps.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: I don't want to say that's a problem per se, because, usually, the tools that get bought are like the DevOps magical bullets that don't exist. But labeling these tools with the term DevOps does help adoption by higher levels of management. If something is labeled DevOps, then you as an engineer or as a developer have a greater chance of working with it.</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer222">
					<p class="qt">" …usually, the tools that get bought are like the DevOps magical bullets that don't exist."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Wian Vos</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent end">If you were to ask me the question, "Is it a bad thing that they basically took DevOps from us and ran with it?," my answer would be that I don't know. I certainly am opposed to the idea that if you just have enough cool, new, and open source tools, then you can call your company a DevOps company. That's something I'm really sick and tired of. I don't know if it's a bad thing or a good thing because it has brought us a lot of cool stuff to play with.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Moving on, let's talk about Kubernetes. Is Kubernetes now the one to rule them all?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: For the next two years, it probably is. In the 10-year period before I became a Puppet engineer where I was doing all kinds of stuff at Puppet and XebiaLabs, and building Platform as a Service stuff, it was easy to call. Back in 2001, it was easy to say we're going to do WebSphere ND for the next three to four years, and probably a long time after that.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">So, in the first decade of this century, it was easy to predict what you were going to do for the next five years, and where to invest, and where to specialize. But since 2009, and even 2010, I have no clue. First, it was Platform as a Service with provisioning. Then it was containerization, or even—and I don't know if you remember this—immutable infrastructure with Foundry, Heroku, and all that cool stuff.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Then came Docker, and that was like, <em class="italics">argh</em>! But let's not forget that the technology was there since the end of the 1990s. Docker just made it usable, and at the time, Docker was the coolest company around: everybody had heard of it, and everybody wanted to work with it. But all of a sudden, Kubernetes burst onto the scene, which is kind of funny because they're basically just as old as Docker, and now Kubernetes is anything and everything. And everybody is standardizing on it. And everybody does it. And everybody has to do it. And everybody wants to work with it. I think it's the most convincing technology I've seen in the last 10 years, just because we need to make sense of this public cloud, and Kubernetes fits into that brilliantly. We might get sick and tired of it in, like, three or four years, because it's a beast of its own. It's complex, and at times difficult. It's controlled by Google and us.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: What I find interesting about Kubernetes is that I don't recall the last time in my career that I actually saw a software, platform, application—or whatever you want to call it—adopted by absolutely every single software vendor in the world. Even traditional software vendors that tend to wait until everyone else adopts a new technology is behind Kubernetes, which I never would have guessed.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: In the 1970s, mainframes were pretty hot. But, in all honesty, the last time I think that happened was with Java application servers. So, I have to agree with you that it's a pretty big movement toward Kubernetes. Then again, most people don't really realize what Kubernetes actually is, because for the most part, if you hear people talk about Kubernetes, they're talking about container workload scheduling, which kind of covers the load.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">But if you look at its real benefits and why it's winning, it's because it brings you a universal interface to any cloud out there. By implementing a Kubernetes cluster, you make deploying workloads almost transparent on AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, Electric Cloud, or any of those cloud port platforms, as long as you don't go for their offered on-prem container as a solution.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Looking at the cloud</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: But then isn't that a threat to those same cloud vendors? If it's so transparent, then I can easily switch from one to another.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: I think that's a good situation for us as consumers. But it does make these vendors compete more for our business. For at least the last five to six years, if you talk to anybody who's somebody in IT, it's all about the cloud. In that time period, we had an unprecedented economic boom. So, I'm wondering what's going to happen once the economy start failing again: Will people have to cut costs again, and if so, then what happens? Are we going back to hardware?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: But is cloud computing more expensive than on-prem?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: Yes.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I have a theory, and I might be wrong, that when you calculate the price per CPU, and if we include the tens of hundreds of people managing that infrastructure on-prem, I actually think it's not that much more expensive when you include the human factor.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: As long as your cloud infrastructure is small enough, you might be right. But if you look at cloud implementations on a large scale, if you're talking thousands and thousands of nodes spread across multiple clouds, they still need a lot of certified, and very expensive, people to run it. I can tell you that an AWS/Google Cloud certified person is a lot more expensive than somebody who has just shuffled around Cisco switches their entire life.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: That's very true.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: So, you could probably get two of them for the price of one cloud specialist.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I once spoke with a person whose company was on-prem, and then they went to the cloud. Eventually, this company went back on-prem with the justification of "Oh, we learned finally, when we were in the cloud, how things should be, so we finally know what we need to do ourselves [on-prem]."</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: I think that is a correct statement. Because, basically—and I'm only very experienced on AWS—if you look at how AWS works, it basically gives you all the same components as your own datacenter. What differs is that it also gives you, as an engineer or as a developer, the controls, which means you don't have to go into endless discussion with the network guys about this and that—this firewall setting, or that firewall setting—or put in a change request and go back and forth. No, you could just sit there, do it, change it—okay, done.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">You still need to know what you're doing. It's not that Amazon has a magical network device that just spits out connections. It just doesn't work like that. So, from that perspective, I think it's good to take your infrastructure to AWS because it clarifies a lot of stuff you've been doing wrong. Do I think it's sustainable for everything? Probably not.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: But it's set certain expectations from your customer. If you are an infrastructure team and everybody else uses Azure, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or whatever, and you're on-prem, then you need to kind of up your game, no?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: Yeah, and that's something we're going to see in the next three or four years. Companies are going to try to figure out, finally, how to do this hybrid thing of having the 60% production capacity that you always need, on-prem. You'll take your flexible capacity, which gives you the flexibility and the capability to take stuff to market quickly. I really think that that's the sweet spot we need.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: In hindsight, you might not be able to answer this question because you work for a company, but one thing I see a lot of today is confusion. Say we work for a company, and we finally made a decision to choose Kubernetes. We then have the problem of choosing one of the 57 different popular flavors and 500 less popular ones, which leaves us with the question of "Now what are we going to do?"</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: I can only give you one piece of advice: choose ours—just kidding. That being said, I think Kubernetes is moving too quickly to choose DIY for production in an enterprise. I'm not saying that if you run a start-up you shouldn't choose DIY Kubernetes, because the feature push from Kubernetes is just awesome, and, truth be told, if I had had my way at my last gig, I would have done it DIY. But that's just hubris. In reality, it's pretty arrogant for an enterprise to think that they can do their own DIY Kubernetes. The whole thing is a big project, and it's moving like nothing we've ever seen before.</p>

					<p class="qt">"I think Kubernetes is moving too quickly to choose DIY for production in an enterprise."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Wian Vos</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal indent end">Basically, Kubernetes almost has more commits than actual Linux Kernel in open source. As a result, I would definitely go for either a distribution, because a distribution solves a lot of the insecurities for you, or maybe a hosted service, where you get actual Kubernetes—not just a reserved namespace in somebody else's pool, but an actual Kubernetes service.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: You've mentioned the number of commits and things like that. To me, that's confusing, but it also presents the idea that Kubernetes needs to slow down for people to actually even grasp it. Because, right now, even choosing the Ingress network is a week's worth of work.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: It's funny that you'd mention that. I had a whole discussion around Kubernetes Ingress just this morning! But yes, I seriously agree. Just choosing your network plugins, edge routers, and stuff like that can easily result in you shooting yourself in the foot with some of the choices you've made.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I think that's why whenever somebody tells me that I'm going to roll Kubernetes on my own, my question is simply, "Why?"</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: Exactly! Why would you do that?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: You're not going to spend the same amount of time that somebody else has spent putting it all together, even when you speak with the people who've spent their whole lives with Kubernetes, such as Kelsey, for example, or Mike Powers. It's kind of like, "I don't know what to choose because, just this morning, a new thing came along."</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: That's exactly what this is. It's a big beast. In fact, it's not unlike Linux was in the early 2000s. If you were to look at the number of actually viable distributions of Linux that there were around then, it was bizarre. There were so many different flavors, and things you could do, and that all boiled down to the big two or three things that are now Linux distributions. So, I think that Kubernetes is going to go the same way as Linux.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">I think the current ecosystem is good, because it brings competition, and that brings change. But I think that Kubernetes is here to stay, simply because our data centers are getting more complex. I know I'm contradicting something I said earlier, but it's like the kernel for the data center, and it'll probably be around in the next decade or two. But there will be less of an ecosystem, with fewer choices.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">The problem with enterprises</h2>
			<p class="normal indent end">Spotify isn't doing its own DIY Kubernetes, and that's what got me thinking. Because, engineering-wise, Spotify is one of the most brilliant companies out there. If you see what they're doing and the stuff they're putting out there, and the slight number of outages they have, they must be doing something right. If companies like that are saying, "No, we are not going to do our DIY Kubernetes," then that should be a sign for everybody else to say, "Alright, if the smartest kid in the class is not going to do it, should I be doing this?"</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: But isn't that one of the big problems with enterprises in general? The idea that somehow every enterprise thinks they're smarter than all the smart kids, that somehow they're different. It's something I hear all the time: "We're going to roll out on our own, the same ways we rolled out our own cloud 10 years ago and failed, the difference being that this time, it's going to be different!"</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: Agreed. In my current role, I advise a lot of businesses on how to do DevOps and containerization. And yes, especially at the lower tech levels, there are a lot of people that did the provisioning thing, brought us all this change, and got the company in a different gear.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">They're all thinking that this Kubernetes thing is going to be just like implementing Puppet or Jenkins. But you have to look at Kubernetes as if it's a different beast, or else it's going to jump up and bite you. I'm not trying to scare you and say that you shouldn't be trying it. Because, at the end of the day, it's fun to do, and it's a great experience. It builds a lot of understanding of how Kubernetes works, and, hopefully, in the end, you'll come to a conclusion that if you're smart, you're not going to want to do it yourself.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Okay, so let's say that we've come to the conclusion that we're not going to do it ourselves. We're going to choose one of the existing platforms—then what? Do we put our old database in our Docker image and ship it in Kubernetes?</p>
			<div>
				<div class="qtFrm" id="_idContainer224">
					<p class="qt">"The biggest problem in DevOps is always persistent data."</p>
					<p class="qt">—Wian Vos</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: Oh, man! That's just a nasty question. I figure you know that, firstly, the biggest problem in DevOps is always persistent data, which is stuff in a database, while the second thing is that traditional databases are not designed to play nice. A typical database in a large enterprise organization is just expensive, let alone the fact that it's a nightmare to manage. So, I would say that you should start by getting those out of your company.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Okay, we agree on that one. But for me, what is motivating is that I have the impression that companies are completely unaware of how much work outside of Kubernetes they need to do in order for something to be successful there, even with their own applications.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: It's not just implementation, and it's not just building a Kubernetes cluster. It's day-two and day-three operations that are going to get you.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: That's very true.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: Again, it's not a given that you have to take everything you do to a Kubernetes platform. It's perfectly okay to run your databases outside of Kubernetes. Ask yourself this: do you really need that much agility on your database cluster? You might, but not everybody does. Then again, do you need Kubernetes? I don't know.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: But to me, that's a curious question, because I have to ask myself, in a few years' time, is Kubernetes even going to be a choice? Yes, we do have a choice not to be in Kubernetes. But if every other vendor is shipping new releases on Kubernetes, is it really even a choice?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: I think it should be, because if it's not a choice anymore, then innovation is dead, and if that was the case, we would have to come up with a whole new ecosystem for the operating system, which is never going to happen again. But there are interesting movements in the whole Kubernetes scene and in everything that's going on around it. For instance, we have received massive amounts of questions about running Kubernetes on bare metal, and I think that's going to be the next big thing for the next three months or so. Because why would you do virtualization on Kubernetes? I don't know—tell me, why do you want to run a kubelet on a virtual machine (VM) when you can just run it on basic bare metal?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: There is no good reason. But on the other hand, other people use VMs because they still don't know what they're doing.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: Yeah, that's very true.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I see it more as an evolution, and once you really know what you're doing, then you'll get rid of the hypervisor as well—but not before.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: Maybe. I think one of the biggest problems is that we have a whole generation of IT people coming in that have never worked on anything else in a VM.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">The big DevOps killer</h2>
			<p class="normal indent end">But if you look at Kubernetes and what you're doing with it, it really doesn't make any sense to have a hypervisor on that. Because to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is basically a virtualization layer between an operating system and the application, you're running it in a container. The argument can be made that it's like a virtual separation. It's not virtualization, but you know what I mean. Then, to have another layer of virtualization under that results in you taking your stuff pretty far from that CPU and memory.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: That may be true, but then how about serverless? Is that the next thing?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: I think serverless is the big DevOps killer.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: In what sense?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: I think it's basically the same as we had at the end of the 1990s, and before that in the 1970s. You as a developer do not want to be bothered with stuff that operations are doing, and because of that, we've have had six to seven years where we all supposedly worked together. But now there's this new thing, which is actually an old thing, where you can just drop in your code, set a route, and there we go! Basically, it's abstracting away the work that operations are doing because there's still somebody who has to take care of that serverless system.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: There are servers then, after all.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: Yes, that's true. But remember, somebody needs to install and maintain it, because, of course, a serverless system will never go wrong—just like anything else will never go wrong within IT, right? I think it's the paradigm that ends DevOps.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">And that's why I think serverless is the big DevOps killer.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I'm talking now on a level of principles, not a specific implementation: what I'm confused about is how serverless is truly different from Kubernetes.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: It's not truly different; that's the thing. I do want to make the distinction between the serverless paradigm and actual serverless platforms. Kubernetes is just a big serverless enabler, and the serverless paradigm just says, "Alright, I'm a developer, I have the code, I drop it here, and I'm done." I think actual serverless platforms have been around since the time of Platform-as-a-Service stuff. If you had a well-implemented Platform-as-a-Service, that was a no-brainer for an application developer anyway.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">I think there's one big paradigm that's come out from the shadow of DevOps that actually does work: Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). Having a great SRE team that gives you a platform that you as a developer can just use is awesome. But is that serverless? I don't know. In the SRE model, you still need an SRE engineer that comes to help you to integrate your code into the platform. Now, if you abstract away enough functionality from the developer, the developer doesn't need that engineer anymore. So, hey presto, a serverless platform—you don't need to worry about the server anymore. But don't forget that there are still servers there, and behind them is an SRE team that actually manages that stuff and innovates on it.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">So, to you as a developer, that becomes serverless. What comes with that, though, is again the loss of interaction between developers and engineers, which is something I think will hinder innovation all over again, because nobody ever got better from not talking to one another.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Exactly. I was confused when you said initially the death of DevOps. But yeah, now I agree.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: If nothing else, DevOps is communication between the application developers and the engineers who build the platform. I once wrote a blog post saying that, and got some really bad feedback on it. So, let me be clear. I'm not saying it's just that communication, but I do think it is a very important component.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">The role of a DevOps engineer</h2>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: But if an important component of DevOps is communication between people skilled in development and people skilled in operations, then what the heck is the role of a DevOps engineer? When I look at job descriptions, I think that of the DevOps engineer tops any other profile at the moment.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: Basically, that's just to confuse recruitment.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: And the DevOps department as well!</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: Imagine, for instance, you and I were going to start a company. We're going to need a DevOps team because we have a burning desire to put out this awesome application. Yet, in our position, we can hire five people. So, the question we have when we're putting together a DevOps team is both, "Who are we hiring?" and "What are we hiring for?"</p>
			<p class="normal indent">Are we going to hire DevOps engineers? No. In that team, we want the best application developers, the best tester, and maybe a great infrastructure person and a frontend/backend developer. I want that DevOps team to be people with specific roles who fit together as a team.</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">Back when DevOps became a marketing term for software companies, recruitment also jumped on that bandwagon. Red Hat is building a DevOps team, so we now need a DevOps engineer, and recruitment says they're going to get you a DevOps engineer. But like you said, for a lot of people in the market, it's still a very attractive job proposition because it includes the word DevOps. In that person's mind, they're no longer doing engineering; they're now doing DevOps.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I have to give credit to Agile in that sense. You never see an Agile engineer.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: No, but they do have Agile coaches, which is another way to say a manager who doesn't wear a tie. Though, to be fair, an Agile coach does have a different perspective on things. Namely, it's more coaching, and more enabling, instead of pushing and holding others accountable. If you look at Agile and project management, Agile is the carrot, and project management is the stick. They're different approaches, and I can tell you, the carrot always works better.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: So, your job is to visit companies and show them the light at the end of the tunnel, with the goal being to help them to improve. I'm wondering, what do you hate the most when you visit a company? What are the major obstacles to accomplishing whatever you're trying to accomplish?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: I think it's almost always people. The biggest problems I've ever had, and the stuff that has cost me the most time and energy, with implementing DevOps, Platform-as-a-Service stuff, new modern infrastructure, or new modern application enablers, is the fact that in many companies there's still this whole consortium of old architects. People who actually work with new technology and platforms and get the opportunity to run their applications on a new Platform as a Service, or serverless platform (or whatever you want to call it) come around quickly enough if they see benefits. While there are good architects out there, architects in a corporate setting are a different story, especially in government. In government, if you have a plan and it's a good plan, it's only a good plan if it was invented there.</p>
			<p class="normal indent">For example, at one government bureau, we basically just built the new platform without architectural approval, and then tried to get that architectural approval four months into the project. Luckily, our sponsor was high enough up on the board of directors at this government company that they were able to push it through. If they hadn't, the whole platform would have been canceled by architecture—by architects just saying, "Yeah, but there's this little detail that we don't like," and stuff like that. It's very much like, "Alright, we didn't think of this, so this must be bad."</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">There was another government institution where I did the same thing. We had the CTO tell us, "Alright, I just want this built. I don't care how you do it. But do it to the best of your ability and inform the architects afterward, and just send them to me once you're done." It was very possible that we would implement a new feature and three months later an architect would just roll by and say, "You didn't tell me that this was implemented." Yeah, alright, but we implemented that feature three months ago and those platforms we built were pretty successful. I mean, if a developer came up to us saying, "Hey, could you change this or that?," we could do it in one or two releases that were, like, three weeks later. But if you have to go through that whole old-school enterprise architectural process, then you're lost; you're gone.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Yeah. I have the same problem with planning.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: Though I have been called an architect on several occasions, by the way. For me, what separates a good architect from just any architect is the fact that you should never architect anything you can't build at least 80% of yourself.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: How many of these architects are actually implementing things? I mean, most architects I meet, their tools are Microsoft Office—they're writing Word documents—while a successful architect is the one who can write more than 200 pages.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: Last year, I was at CLOUDBUSTING, a mini-conference put together by Software Circus, which is this meet-up group we have here in the Netherlands. At the conference, I heard a talk by a guy who had a great couple of examples of how architectural mishaps come to life when you let traditional IT architects into your company, because you can write a great architecture document, hand it to people that actually build things, and find that it's not going to work. Especially in today's software world, it's very arrogant to think that you can foresee everything upfront. Especially <a id="_idTextAnchor101"/>if you have never built it yourself—you don't know what works.</p>

			<p class="normal indent"><a id="_idTextAnchor102"/>My favorite architectural style is evolutionary architecture. We need provisioning, so let's take three tools, test them out for a week, and really give them a shakedown to see what works. At the end of the week, you can be like, "Alright, this one works, but the other two don't. Therefore, we go and innovate on this. But how are we going to implement it? Let's try three or four different ways and just roll with it, and then choose the best one and innovate on that."</p>
			<p class="normal indent end">So, I really think that it's very important to have your architectural process not get in the way, and for you to have your architects in your team. If you're running an SRE team that's building a platform for a customer, make sure that the one with the architectural skills—but more so the architectural responsibility—is in that team and building it with you. Just like a lead engineer, who is authorized to make decisions with the rest of the team.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Exactly. The only thing I would add is that they've also got to feel. I believe that nobody should be allowed to make any decision if he or she cannot feel the pain behind those decisions. Typically, architecture is just, "Here it is: a diagram to help you to implement it."</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: True, but then again, that was initially what DevOps was all about. You take a part of your business responsibility, you give it to a team, and you build it and run it. So, if an application developer comes up with screwed-up code that doesn't behave, then it's not the operations person that gets called out of their bed at two o'clock in the morning, it's the actual applications person, and because of that, they're more motivated to build something that works.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Brilliant. I don't want to take much more of your time, but do you have any closing comments?</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: All I will say is this: there's no right or wrong answer in this whole DevOps discussion. It's more about the fact that I think DevOps has become more of a cultural boost, and I think it's very important to enable people who are actually using and building the platforms to choose the things that they know are right for the company. But also, they need to be allowed to share their knowledge within the company.</p>
			<h2 class="introHdg">Celebrating your failures</h2>
			<p class="normal indent end">I know it's mushy, but actually, one of the key points to know is to also celebrate your failures. If you fail to communicate that you failed and explore why and how you failed, you're missing out on a learning opportunity. As soon as you start celebrating your failures, people will feel less scared to fail. I also think that the most innovative engineer is an engineer who feels free to innovate.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: We just need to convince management not to fire people when they fail.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: Right! That's one of the most important mind-shifts that you, as a manager, need to make in DevOps.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: But isn't that kind of embracing the inevitable? Saying that you know that you're going to fail?</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: True, but if you don't embrace failure, your team is going to cover it up for you, and they're not going to learn anything. Or if the person that failed might learn something, the rest won't learn anything. I think that's something that GitLab did maybe a year ago—admin 55—that whole thing.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Exactly! I can't express how much respect I have for them after that. GitLab are my heroes, only because of how they handled the failure.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: They said, "Hey, we've royally screwed up. Here's how to have at it."</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Yeah, I remember. I was watching their video feed while they were fixing it as if it was a Latin American telenovela. It was awesome.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: That was<a id="_idIndexMarker043"/> awesome, and I think that should be something most companies are willing to do. But right now, we're a long way away from that.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: Very long. At least when I visit companies, I don't feel that I am allowed to behave like that yet.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: Well, I must say, in Holland, it's getting better. As I've already said, I also worked in the US for two years, where it's a whole different ball game.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Viktor Farcic</strong>: I think this is a great place to stop. Thank you for your time. I really enjoyed this.</p>
			<p class="normal end"><strong class="bold">Wian Vos</strong>: No problem. Thank you very much.</p>
