<p>The main focus of this book is to shed light on serverless and different service provider for serverless. It also teaches how to adopt an automated way to set up DevOps for serverless functions.</p>
<p>You have an understanding of DevOps, continuous integration, and continuous deployment, and should have some knowledge of popular DevOps tools such as Jenkins, ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana). It is an added advantage if you know about different cloud service providers, such as AWS, Azure, and Google.</p>
<p>Most of my tutorials are build on top of MacBook and Docker containers, so I would recommend using some form of Linux for the tutorials.</p>
