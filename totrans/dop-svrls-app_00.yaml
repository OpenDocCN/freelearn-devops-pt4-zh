- en: Serverless development provides developers with the freedom to just concentrate
    on development and not worrying about the server-side aspects. This book aims
    to simplify your serverless deployment experience by showing you how to effectively
    apply DevOps principles to serverless applications. At each step along the way,
    you will be introduced to best practices for effectively building a complete Continuous
    Integration and Continuous Delivery pipeline and log management for serverless
    applications.
