- en: I started my professional career as a young engineering project manager at a
    high-tech manufacturing facility at **Texas Instruments**. I had no idea then
    that the basic concepts I learned about Lean production processes would serve
    me well throughout my career as a software product manager (*computer-aided software
    engineering – CASE and workflow* tools) and as a consultant and IT project manager
    in the development of business applications for business process improvements.
    However, my work in those areas was always about improving organizational value
    streams outside of the IT department.

    in early 2000 through the insights of people such as Mary and Tom Poppendieck
    in their book *Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit*. By 2010, the concepts
    behind Lean-Agile practices began to make their way into software development
    methodologies, such as the **Scaled Agile Framework** and **Disciplined Agile**.
    Finally, we began to see the practical application of Lean production improvement
    concepts applied to IT-oriented value streams in the form of modern **value stream
    management** (**VSM**) software tools and platforms.'

- en: As you will discover in this book, VSM is an approach to make Lean improvements
    across all development and operational value streams. A value stream is simply
    an end-to-end sequence of activities where work and information flow in a coordinated
    and streamlined manner to deliver value (for example, products, services, and
    results) most effectively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In its modern reinvention, the software development industry applies VSM tools
    to integrate, automate, and orchestrate work across DevOps pipelines to improve
    the end-to-end activities involved in software deliveries across both the development
    and operations functions. Rather than manually collecting data, modern VSM tools
    capture critical performance metrics in real time and provide a common data model
    and analytical tools to assess both current and desired future state conditions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In short, modern VSM tools offer a convergence of data and analytical capabilities
    that are necessary to make informed decisions to improve your software delivery
    flows. Implementing DevOps methods, configurations, and tools on an enterprise
    scale is not trivial or inexpensive. On the other hand, VSM tools provide the
    data you need to get the most out of your IT investments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's been an arduous journey to bring the thoughts and ideas together for this
    book, including input from the VSM Consortium, 16 tool vendors – with research
    on 24 software tool companies in all, plus the two leading Lean-Agile Framework
    companies and two of the leading Lean training and methodology companies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, it was like herding cats pulling all the information together from
    these disparate sources! However, the result, I believe, represents the most comprehensive
    source of VSM methods and tools to date. Moreover, this book also helps explain
    how DevOps and VSM go hand-in-hand to help drive competitive outcomes in a digital
    economy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Recall that VSM is not a new concept, though more recently applied to help make
    lean-oriented improvements across IT value streams. Organizations that practice
    Lean production improvement concepts use VSM practices to improve all development
    and operational value streams. As a strategic enabler, VSM initiatives help discover
    and prioritize many potential improvement opportunities across the enterprise,
    to deliver value more effectively. And many of those identified value stream improvement
    opportunities are digital enhancements best realized through software applications.

- en: For example, in our digital economy, businesses create software applications
    as commercial offerings or to deliver information or entertainment services as
    web-based services. However, software can also enhance physical products, such
    as the navigation and control systems in automobiles. Finally, businesses, government
    agencies, and non-profits use software applications to improve the flow of value
    across their critical business processes and value stream activities.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Through my research and discussions with many of the leading VSM, DevOps, and
    Lean organizations, I have concluded that organizations must integrate their IT-based
    VSM tool strategies into their corporate strategic VSM initiatives. While Lean
    is a relatively new concept in IT, the rest of the organization has likely been
    practicing Lean concepts for decades – or, at least, they should have been. That's
    not true just in manufacturing, as many service companies and healthcare providers
    have implemented Lean practices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book, you will learn how to apply a generic VSM methodology that can
    help identify improvements in organizational development and operational value
    streams, not just IT. This approach was taken purposely for the reasons noted
    above. Organizations use VSM methods and tools to identify and prioritize improvement
    opportunities across all value streams, many of which require software to make
    the improvements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other words, VSM methods address two broad areas to make value stream improvements.
    First, modern VSM methods and tools help improve DevOps-based software delivery
    capabilities. Second, the same VSM strategies and techniques help identify digital
    improvement opportunities across other organizational value streams to direct
    the organization's improved software delivery capabilities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, VSM is not limited to making value stream flow improvements in DevOps. From
    the perspective of *systems thinking*, making value stream improvements to DevOps
    is a form of making *localized optimizations*. In other words, if software delivery
    is not the bottleneck in our business system, or if we don't know how to apply
    our improved software delivery capabilities, then the time and resources spent
    on the effort to improve our system as a whole may have little or no impact.

    time and money implementing DevOps toolchains and platforms, but you have not
    seen a justifiable return on investment.**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may not know much about Lean practices yet, but that's OK. You will learn
    in this book that it's all about discovering and eliminating wastes that hinder
    flow, which in turn cause bottlenecks, delays, excessive work in process, and
    ultimately higher costs that your customers don't want to pay. For these reasons,
    Lean practitioners always have a cost and time to market or delivery advantage
    over their competitors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main point is that an enterprise can spend much time and effort on their
    DevOps and VSM tool initiatives but not see a justifiable ROI – unless they use
    those software delivery improvements to help improve the organization's other
    operational and development value streams. So, DevOps teams should align their
    activities to help make improvements across all organizational value streams.
    Moreover, it's the Corporate VSM initiatives, through their Kaizen Bursts (future
    state improvement opportunity scenarios), that help identify and prioritize the
    areas where the improved DevOps capabilities can have the most timely and beneficial
    impacts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For these reasons, this book introduces the historical foundations behind the
    concept of adding value, Agile's values and principles, systems and lean thinking,
    and VSM and their modern context in IT. You will discover how to use VSM as a
    methodology to discover areas for improvement across all organizational value
    streams, while simultaneously using VSM tools to make Lean-oriented improvements
    in your DevOps-based software delivery pipelines. But ultimately, you will find
    that it's the integration of DevOps to support Lean-oriented improvements across
    all organizational value streams that help justify the time, expense, and effort
    associated with installing VSM tools and DevOps toolchains and pipelines.
