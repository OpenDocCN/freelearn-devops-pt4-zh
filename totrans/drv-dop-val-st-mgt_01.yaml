    and proven approach to make flow improvements across an enterprise.

    and improve DevOps pipeline implementations. In that context, these chapters help
    explain why the effective implementation of a DevOps pipeline – as an efficient
    software delivery system – is the necessary “table stake” that allow an organization
    to compete in our modern digital economy.
