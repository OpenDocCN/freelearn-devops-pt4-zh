    how Agile, Systems Thinking, and Lean Development work together to deliver customer-centric
    value. With this base of understanding, **Value Stream Management** (**VSM**)
    and **DevOps(development-operations)** are also introduced as complementary **Information
    Technology** (**IT**) practices and tools to support **Lean-Agile** practices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will learn how VSM helps maximize the flow of customer value across an organization's
    software development and delivery processes. For example, VSM helps improve the
    flow of work across **systems development life cycle** (**SDLC**) processes when
    developing applications supporting business operations.

    practices for business systems in a digital economy. Many commercial businesses,
    government agencies, and nonprofits offer information-oriented products and services
    delivered as web-based services. Additionally, many physical products incorporate
    computing devices, software, and internet access to deliver new features and enhanced
    functionality on demand and throughout their life cycles.

    than with traditional SDLC and Agile practices.

    involves including and aligning IT with the value stream transformations occurring
    across the enterprise. VSM is a Lean production improvement strategy that's found
    new applications in IT. Since VSM is the primary focus of this book, let's start
    with definitions of value in a VSM context.

    of product life cycle activities required to guide product deliveries from ideation
    through creation, deployment, support, retirement, and sustainment. As the name
    *value stream* implies, the whole point is to ensure all product delivery activities
    add value. From the perspective of Lean, adding customer-centric value means going
    beyond the provisioning of features and functions to also eliminate all forms
    of waste that customers don''t want to have added to their costs.'

    and efficiency while lowering costs. More precisely, you will learn that VSM encompasses
    Lean-oriented methods to improve work and information flow across value streams.
    Modern VSM tools support the VSM methods initially developed by Toyota as an approach
    to map material and information flows, and then later introduced to the rest of
    the world in the early 2000s (Jones, Womack, 2003).

    products, information, and services, either online or through personal contacts.
    In contrast, development-oriented value streams create products and services for
    either internal or external customers. In other words, development value streams
    build stuff, while operations value streams need to sell, deliver, and support
    the organization's customers.
  prefs: []

    between development and operations is important in terms of purpose, planning
    horizons, and who controls and funds the activities. For example, LOB executives
    and product owners have accountability over investment priorities in their operations-oriented
    value stream activities. In contrast, portfolio management team controls investment
    priorities over development-oriented stream activities.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of selling, delivering, and supporting products. These are tactical activities
    that provide value to our customers, usually over relatively short planning horizons.
    Development value stream investments tend to be larger, are critical to the organization's
    long-term survival, and require longer planning and implementation horizons. In
    contrast, development-oriented value streams help ensure the organization has
    the infrastructure, products, and services to meet its strategic objectives.

    and user issues via helpdesk services.

    within a business enterprise relative to products and services. The relationships
    must be mutually beneficial—in other words, all parties within the value networks
    receive value from their relationships. When this is not the case, the networks
    fail to meet their goals and expectations, and the relationships usually become
    disruptive. In extreme cases, the networks fall apart and the participants exit

    term *value stream* in their book, *The Machine that Changed the World* (Womack,
    Jones, Roos; 1990). Womack indeed discussed value streams in his later books,
    such as *Lean Thinking* (Womack; 1996, 2003) and *Seeing the Whole Value Stream*
    (Womack, Jones; 2003). However, James Martin was the first to define the concepts
    of **value streams** in detail in his book *The Great Transition: Using the Seven
    Disciplines of Enterprise Engineering to Align People, Technology, and Strategy*
    (Martin, 1995).'
  prefs: []

    mapping* in Lean, but that's an incorrect association. Martin briefly introduces
    lean manufacturing concepts in his book, but his association of value streams
    with lean manufacturing applies to reinventing workflows around customer value
    (Martin, 1995, p. 102). In contrast, value stream mapping is a visual technique
    to assess information and material flows. We'll talk more about value stream mapping
    in the following subsection.
  prefs: []

- en: Martin defines value streams as an "*end-to-end collection of activities that
    create a result for a 'customer', who may be the ultimate customer or an internal
    "end-user" of the value stream"*. Martin also notes that a value stream must have
    a clear goal to satisfy or delight. Martin introduces value streams as an approach
    to reinvent business processes to support customer needs by developing products
    in the most "*simple, direct, and narrowly focused fashion*".
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Martin wrote his book when **business process reengineering** (**BPR**) was
    a mainstream concept, and IT organizations worked with functional and cross-functional
    business organizations to streamline and automate critical business processes.
    Martin keenly observed that business processes traditionally evolved through successive
    changes driven by internal needs and not by customer needs. As a result, many
    business processes are bloated, inefficient, and anything but customer-centric.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Martin introduces his value stream concepts as an E2E redesign of business processes
    at the activity or task level to create better flows. Martin makes the point that
    too many business systems evolved to support then-existing business processes,
    and those underlying processes too often evolved to support dubious agendas and
    objectives.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A better approach is to eliminate the concept of business processes and instead
    have organizations reevaluate their enterprise as a collection of value streams,
    all of which likely need reinventing. This approach identifies what customers
    value and then assesses an organization's collections of activities that deliver
    the value (that is, value streams). The next step is to streamline the identified
    value streams. Only then should an organization consider developing information
    systems and automation to support their newly formed value streams.

    system that describe how stakeholders—either internal or external customers—receive
    value from an organization. A business value stream includes a series of steps
    or activities necessary to provide the products, services, and experiences our
    customers desire at a more fundamental level.
  prefs: []

- en: Value streams can support product development and delivery activities and any
    other customer-facing services. While development-oriented value streams can provide
    products and services directly to customers or resale partners, a more typical
    scenario is that they deliver products and services to operations or customer-facing
    value streams. Steps that do not add value represent waste in the eyes of the
    customer—in other words, customers do not want to pay for things that add waste
    without adding value.

    to the basic concepts behind DevOps and how it helps instantiate at least some
    of the values and principles of Agile.

    for Agile Software Development* to improve their focus on the customer, speed
    of delivery, and efficiencies. Organizations do not need to integrate or automate
    their Agile-based SDLC and operations-oriented processes to achieve significant
    benefits. On the other hand, those organizations that do can rapidly accelerate
    their pace of delivering new value.

    communications and integration between development and operations. The feedback
    from operations helps development teams create a more VA, sustainable, and higher-quality
    product. The collaborations also help the development teams deploy products that
    are easier to deploy, configure, secure, and roll back when necessary.
  prefs: []

    much reengineering is dependent upon the current state of the IT organization.
    Those organizations still practicing traditional *Waterfall*-type practices require
    more significant changes to their processes and culture than those who practice
    agile-based approaches such as *Scrum* or **eXtreme Programming** (**XP**). Agile-based
    methodologies already reengineer traditional SDLC processes from a linear-sequential
    development life cycle process to an iterative and incremental development cycle,

- en: The primary difference is that Waterfall treats these activities across singular
    projects as a linear-sequential and plan-driven process. The traditional model
    lengthens the overall lead time to deliver previously identified value, which
    often creates a host of problems in finding and fixing bugs. Late deliveries may
    effectively deliver what customers thought they wanted but not provide what they
    need at the delivery time. The organization must justify, fund, and initiate new
    projects before adding new enhancements and correcting defects (previously unidentified
    customer requirements) in the product, which usually pushes the new work out into
    the next fiscal year. By then, it is too late.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast, Agile treats SDLC activities as a cyclical process that does not
    stop until the ROI for continued development no longer supports the cost of adding
    new value. Agile-based practices release new value incrementally across multiple
    iterative development cycles as a frequent and repetitive pattern. Short delivery
    cycles keep the code small between testing, making bugs and defects easier to
    find and resolve. Frequent customer reviews and team retrospectives help ensure
    the team stays continuously focused on their customers' current needs, priorities,
    and requests for improvements.

    about improving collaborations and communications across the development function.
    DevOps started as a strategy to improve collaborations and communications between
    development- and operations-oriented teams. In its current form, DevOps promotes
