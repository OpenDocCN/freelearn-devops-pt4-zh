    across the enterprise. VSM is a Lean production improvement strategy that's found

- en: '**Value streams** are a **Lean production** concept that describes the series
    of product life cycle activities required to guide product deliveries from ideation
    through creation, deployment, support, retirement, and sustainment. As the name
    *value stream* implies, the whole point is to ensure all product delivery activities
    add value. From the perspective of Lean, adding customer-centric value means going
    beyond the provisioning of features and functions to also eliminate all forms
    of waste that customers don''t want to have added to their costs.'
  id: totrans-17
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: VSM is an approach to methodically eliminate waste and improve productivity
    and efficiency while lowering costs. More precisely, you will learn that VSM encompasses
    Lean-oriented methods to improve work and information flow across value streams.
    Modern VSM tools support the VSM methods initially developed by Toyota as an approach
    to map material and information flows, and then later introduced to the rest of
    the world in the early 2000s (Jones, Womack, 2003).

    products, information, and services, either online or through personal contacts.
    In contrast, development-oriented value streams create products and services for
    either internal or external customers. In other words, development value streams
    build stuff, while operations value streams need to sell, deliver, and support
    the organization's customers.
  id: totrans-25
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both functions are necessary and value-adding. However, making a distinction
    between development and operations is important in terms of purpose, planning
    horizons, and who controls and funds the activities. For example, LOB executives
    and product owners have accountability over investment priorities in their operations-oriented
    value stream activities. In contrast, portfolio management team controls investment
    priorities over development-oriented stream activities.
  id: totrans-26

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way to look at this distinction is the operations-oriented processes
    of selling, delivering, and supporting products. These are tactical activities
    that provide value to our customers, usually over relatively short planning horizons.
    Development value stream investments tend to be larger, are critical to the organization's
    long-term survival, and require longer planning and implementation horizons. In
    contrast, development-oriented value streams help ensure the organization has
    the infrastructure, products, and services to meet its strategic objectives.

  zh: 另一种看待这种区分的方式是销售、交付和支持产品的运营导向过程。这些是为我们的客户提供价值的战术性活动，通常具有相对较短的规划周期。开发价值流的投资通常更大，对组织的长期生存至关重要，需要更长的规划和实施周期。相对而言，开发导向的价值流有助于确保组织具备满足战略目标所需的基础设施、产品和服务。
- en: At first glance, this distinction between development and operations seems to
    support the traditional IT organizational model. Development teams create software
    products for both internal and external customers or users, and operations teams
    exist to keep systems running, secure, and available, while also resolving customer
    and user issues via helpdesk services.

    called **ontology** is devoted to the subject. If you look up the word *ontology*,
    you will find that the term's origins come from a branch of metaphysics that deals
    with the *nature of being* or *what exists*. Ontology is a compound word that
    combines *onto* (Greek *ὄν*) and "*being; that which is*" (*gen. ὄντος, ontos*).

    such as *Lean Thinking* (Womack; 1996, 2003) and *Seeing the Whole Value Stream*

    with lean manufacturing applies to reinventing workflows around customer value
    (Martin, 1995, p. 102). In contrast, value stream mapping is a visual technique

    create a result for a 'customer', who may be the ultimate customer or an internal

    a clear goal to satisfy or delight. Martin introduces value streams as an approach
    to reinvent business processes to support customer needs by developing products
    in the most "*simple, direct, and narrowly focused fashion*".

    a mainstream concept, and IT organizations worked with functional and cross-functional
    business organizations to streamline and automate critical business processes.
    Martin keenly observed that business processes traditionally evolved through successive
    changes driven by internal needs and not by customer needs. As a result, many
    business processes are bloated, inefficient, and anything but customer-centric.

    objectives.

    have organizations reevaluate their enterprise as a collection of value streams,
    all of which likely need reinventing. This approach identifies what customers
    value and then assesses an organization's collections of activities that deliver
    the value (that is, value streams). The next step is to streamline the identified
    value streams. Only then should an organization consider developing information
    systems and automation to support their newly formed value streams.

    other customer-facing services. While development-oriented value streams can provide
    products and services directly to customers or resale partners, a more typical
    scenario is that they deliver products and services to operations or customer-facing
    value streams. Steps that do not add value represent waste in the eyes of the
    customer—in other words, customers do not want to pay for things that add waste
    without adding value.

    much reengineering is dependent upon the current state of the IT organization.
    Those organizations still practicing traditional *Waterfall*-type practices require
    more significant changes to their processes and culture than those who practice
    agile-based approaches such as *Scrum* or **eXtreme Programming** (**XP**). Agile-based
    methodologies already reengineer traditional SDLC processes from a linear-sequential
    development life cycle process to an iterative and incremental development cycle,
    from a practical standpoint.

    projects as a linear-sequential and plan-driven process. The traditional model
    lengthens the overall lead time to deliver previously identified value, which
    often creates a host of problems in finding and fixing bugs. Late deliveries may
    effectively deliver what customers thought they wanted but not provide what they
    need at the delivery time. The organization must justify, fund, and initiate new
    projects before adding new enhancements and correcting defects (previously unidentified
    customer requirements) in the product, which usually pushes the new work out into
    the next fiscal year. By then, it is too late.

    stop until the ROI for continued development no longer supports the cost of adding
    new value. Agile-based practices release new value incrementally across multiple
    iterative development cycles as a frequent and repetitive pattern. Short delivery
    cycles keep the code small between testing, making bugs and defects easier to
    find and resolve. Frequent customer reviews and team retrospectives help ensure
    the team stays continuously focused on their customers' current needs, priorities,
    and requests for improvements.

    or automation strategy. Those ideas came later. Instead, the Agile Manifesto speaks
    about improving collaborations and communications across the development function.
    DevOps started as a strategy to improve collaborations and communications between
    development- and operations-oriented teams. In its current form, DevOps promotes
    IT agility through collaboration, integration, and automation across IT to rapidly
    deliver customer value, higher quality, and less stress.

    beyond the traditional SDLC processes to link the activities and people within
    IT operations. Second, DevOps evolved in lockstep with CI and automation capabilities,
    which further accelerated the ideation-to-value-delivery lead time while simultaneously
    improving the quality of delivery.

    determine what the new process needs to look like and then executes the work to
