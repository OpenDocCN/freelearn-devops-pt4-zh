			<p>The IT industry undergoes constant evolution to deliver customer-centric value more quickly and efficiently and with higher quality. Some improvement concepts, such as Agile and DevOps, came directly from the software industry. However, Lean, Systems Thinking, and Value Stream Management all have their origins outside the software industry. Still, all these practices are now mainstream in the software and digital products and services delivery industries.</p>
			<p>Though this book is about applying VSM and DevOps practices to accelerate digital value delivery, it's essential that each organization establishes a base of foundational practices. Specifically, IT organizations need to build their VSM and DevOps capabilities upon a solid value-centric foundation of Agile, Lean, and Systems Thinking practices.</p>
			<p>This chapter will help Lean-Agile practitioners understand how to build this integrated foundation. We'll explore Systems Thinking in the next chapter. For now, in this chapter, you will learn how Agile and Lean practices work in concert to deliver customer-centric value.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Instilling the values and principles of Agile</li>
				<li>Gaining stakeholder support</li>
				<li>Implementing useful metrics</li>
				<li>Improving IT flows through Lean Thinking</li>
				<li>Eliminating waste in software development</li>
				<li>Creating the Lean-Agile foundation</li>
				<li>Accelerating flows across IT value streams</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Instilling the values and principles of Agile</h1>
			<p>In the previous chapter, you learned that the Manifesto for Agile Software Development (also known as the Agile Manifesto, <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">https://agilemanifesto.org/</a>) laid out 4 values and 12 principles for <a id="_idIndexMarker177"/>improving software delivery. If you are new to Agile, you may not know that Agile is not a specific or single methodology. There is no guidance in the <a id="_idIndexMarker178"/>Agile Manifesto on how to instill Agile's values and principles, only a description of desirable outcomes or objectives.</p>
			<p>Another way to think about the Agile Manifesto's values and principles is the notion of being Agile and not doing agile. In other words, while there are many things we can do to improve software development agility, the Agile Manifesto does not provide prescriptive guidance on how to do Agile.</p>
			<p>Many methodologies claim to be Agile. For those who need a primer, I introduced Agile's history and the industry-leading Agile and Lean-Agile methodologies in my previous book, <em class="italic">Scaling Scrum Across Modern Enterprises</em>. At the time of writing this book, the leading Agile methodology at the small team level is Scrum – including several hybrid versions that enable multiple teams to work together in collaboration.</p>
			<p>In contrast, the <a id="_idIndexMarker179"/>leading multi-team Lean-Agile <a id="_idIndexMarker180"/>methodology is <strong class="bold">Scaled Agile Inc.'s</strong> <strong class="bold">Scaled-Agile Framework®</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAFe®</strong>). Another Lean-Agile methodology that's gathering <a id="_idIndexMarker181"/>traction is <strong class="bold">Disciplined Agile</strong>, offered <a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>by the <strong class="bold">Project Management Institute</strong> (<strong class="bold">PMI</strong>). Later in this chapter, in the <em class="italic">Creating the Lean-Agile foundation</em> section, you will learn how Lean-Agile practices extend the basic Agile practices of iterative and incremental development.</p>
			<p>For now, it's essential to understand that VSM and DevOps build on the concepts of Agile and Lean. Therefore, the organization must establish a base of Agile and Lean practices and allow the culture to evolve around these practices, before installing the process integration and automation capabilities that VSM and DevOps employ.</p>
			<p>Integrating and automating flawed or poorly implemented processes only accelerates the undesirable outcomes of flawed processes. Undesirable outcomes include building products with features and functions that customers don't want, delivering inferior quality products, and delivering products with bugs and defects. Integration and automation won't fix those types of problems without reengineering the underlying development and operations processes.</p>
			<p>Both Agile and Lean-Agile methodologies help organizations instill Agile's values and principles through <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/>the practices they implement. However, the scale and the level of sponsorship drive most decisions on which Agile methodology is the most appropriate and supports the needs of a software development team or program. We'll take a moment to quickly review the leading Scrum and Lean-Agile methodologies in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Leading Scrum and Lean-Agile methodologies</h2>
			<p>There's nothing that <a id="_idIndexMarker184"/>says an organization can't figure out on their <a id="_idIndexMarker185"/>own how to become Agile and Lean in their operations. On the other hand, why start from scratch when there are proven methodologies to help guide its efforts? The question then is, what methodologies and practices are most appropriate to the organization?</p>
			<p>My previous book, <em class="italic">Scaling Scrum Across the Modern Enterprise</em> (Rupp, 2020), with Packt Publishing, presents detailed descriptions of many historical and currently leading Lean-Agile practices. Rather than repeating that information, this section will provide a short instruction to the current industry-leading Scrum and Lean-Agile methodologies and frameworks:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scrum</strong>: Developed in the 1990s, Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland formalized their <strong class="bold">Scrum Framework</strong> as a <strong class="bold">Scrum Guide</strong> in 2010. Scrum implements a framework <a id="_idIndexMarker186"/>based on empiricism – a theory that all knowledge comes from experience derived <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>from observations using our senses (that is, sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell, spatial, and so on). <em class="italic">Empiricists</em> value evidenced-based knowledge derived through experience, observation, and testing hypotheses through experimentation (that is, <em class="italic">the scientific method</em>).<p>Schwaber and Sutherland continue to update the Scrum Guide, with the most recent version being released in November 2020. Their latest version declares that the foundations of Scrum also include Lean concepts. However, they have not made this claim in their preceding versions of the Scrum Guide. And their discussion of Lean in the latest Scrum Guide is limited to the statement that <em class="italic">Lean Thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials</em>.</p><p>In a nutshell, the <a id="_idIndexMarker188"/>Scrum Framework implements iterative <strong class="bold">Sprints</strong> as a <a id="_idIndexMarker189"/>container to implement other practices and activities, all executed with agility, to deliver incremental value over short but frequent intervals. The container notion is essential as the IT industry employs countless technologies, methods, tools, and techniques. It makes no sense for a single Agile methodology to try to force a particular development strategy. Instead, the Scrum Framework guides the team's use of their preferred methods and tools in an Agile manner to deliver incremental value across each Sprint.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scrum-of-Scrums</strong>: The original <a id="_idIndexMarker190"/>scaling extension to Scrum, implemented as a team-of-teams structure, applies Scrum practices across multiple teams working in collaboration. The Scrum-of-Scrums model is generalized to coordinate small teams' efforts beyond the IT function, with all the teams cooperating to deliver the same product.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scrum at Scale</strong>: Jeff Sutherland's extension <a id="_idIndexMarker191"/>to the Scrum Guide scales the basic Scrum-of-Scrums concepts enterprise-wide and across business <a id="_idIndexMarker192"/>domains with <strong class="bold">minimum viable bureaucracy</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVB</strong>) via scale-free architectures.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">The Nexus Framework</strong>: Ken Schwaber's (Scrum.org) extension to the Scrum Guide implements <strong class="bold">Network Integration Teams</strong> (<strong class="bold">NITs</strong>) to <a id="_idIndexMarker193"/>manage cross-team dependencies, as <a id="_idIndexMarker194"/>well as integration and synchronization issues, on <a id="_idIndexMarker195"/>multi-team software product development efforts.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Large-Scale Scrum</strong> (<strong class="bold">LeSS</strong>): This <a id="_idIndexMarker196"/>scaled <a id="_idIndexMarker197"/>Scrum approach, from Craig Larman and Bas Vodde, includes two Scrum scaling frameworks that help coordinate multiple teams' activities. The LeSS Framework coordinates multiple Scrum teams around <em class="italic">features</em>, while the LeSS Huge Framework coordinates the activities around <em class="italic">requirements areas</em>. Both frameworks support multi-team collaborations to develop large and complex software-enabled products.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Disciplined Agile</strong> (<strong class="bold">DA</strong>): This is a <a id="_idIndexMarker198"/>Lean-Agile approach to development that provides six product development life cycles, numerous <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/>process guides, and hundreds of potentially useful techniques. The DA approach allows teams to choose their preferred <em class="italic">way of working</em> to support their unique business and organizational needs and situations. Initially developed by Scott Ambler and Mark Lines, the <strong class="bold">Project Management Institute</strong> (<strong class="bold">PMI</strong>) acquired <a id="_idIndexMarker200"/>their firm in 2019 plus <strong class="bold">FLow for Enterprise Transformation</strong> (<strong class="bold">FLEX</strong>) from <strong class="bold">Net Objectives</strong>. Flex integrates <a id="_idIndexMarker201"/>with DA to implement Lean and Systems Thinking to improve organizational business agility.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scaled Agile Framework®</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAFe®</strong>): With <a id="_idIndexMarker202"/>four configurations, SAFe is a Lean-Agile approach for big organizations <a id="_idIndexMarker203"/>working on large-scale product development efforts. SAFe helps large organizations leverage their economies of scale to provide greater efficiencies while incorporating Lean-Agile practices to enable business agility at enterprise scale. The four SAFe configurations are as follows:<ul><li><strong class="bold">Essential SAFe®</strong>: This is the foundational multi-team Lean-Agile scaling model, built around a team-of-teams concept called Agile Release Teams (ARTs). The size of each ART typically ranges between 50 and 125 people, constrained by Dunbar's number and derived from cognitive limitations regarding the number of stable relationships humans can actively maintain.</li></ul><p>Teams within an ART collaborate to support a single large product or individual value stream. Small teams within the <a id="_idIndexMarker204"/>ARTs situationally practice <strong class="bold">eXtreme Programming</strong> (<strong class="bold">XP</strong>), Scrum, and DevOps, and all collaborate to deliver integrated and incremental <a id="_idIndexMarker205"/>value over time-boxed <strong class="bold">Program Increments</strong> (<strong class="bold">PIs</strong>), which are typically 8 to 12 weeks long. XP, Scrum, and DevOps operate on smaller intervals and sync up with each PI.</p><ul><li><strong class="bold">Large Solution SAFe®</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker206"/>extends to the <em class="italic">Essential SAFe</em> Lean-Agile foundation to coordinate and integrate <a id="_idIndexMarker207"/>the work of multiple ARTs supporting very large products or large volumes of products.<em class="italic"> Large Solution SAFe</em> synchronizes any number of ARTs and hundreds to tens of thousands of team members.</li><li><strong class="bold">Portfolio SAFe®</strong>: Aligns portfolio execution <a id="_idIndexMarker208"/>with the <a id="_idIndexMarker209"/>enterprise strategy by organizing the Lean-Agile Enterprise around the flow of value through its value streams. <em class="italic">SAFe Portfolios</em> are a collection of development and operations-oriented value streams that operate within a business unit. This SAFe configuration <a id="_idIndexMarker210"/>also adds <strong class="bold">Lean Portfolio Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">LPM</strong>) concepts to monitor and assess planned portfolio investment needs across time.</li><li><strong class="bold">Full SAFe®</strong>: Links <em class="italic">Essential</em>, <em class="italic">Large Solution</em>, and <em class="italic">Portfolio SAFe</em> as <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>an integrated and coordinated <a id="_idIndexMarker212"/>set of processes and activities.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Any of the previously discussed Scrum and Hybrid Scrum methodologies and frameworks can help your organization improve the agility of individual or multiple teams, working collaboratively to develop a single product or product line. Both DA and SAFe also include robust approaches to implementing Lean software development concepts and portfolio management processes to support strategic planning, funding priorities, and resource allocation across multiple product lines.</p>
			<p>No matter which <a id="_idIndexMarker213"/>Scrum or Lean-Agile approach you choose <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/>to employ, its success is primarily dependent upon the level of sponsorship relative to the size and scope of the implementation. Leadership and executive sponsorship are the topics of the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Leading the way</h2>
			<p>The implementation of <a id="_idIndexMarker215"/>Agile and Lean practices has organization-wide implications that impact the potential success of any implementation. Moreover, the larger the implementation, the broader the impact, and having the appropriate leadership and sponsorship levels is critical to its success. Ideally, the organization's Chief Executive leads the way.</p>
			<p>Small software development teams can sometimes implement XP and Scrum practices at the small team level with minimal sponsorship. However, such implementations often find it challenging to obtain information on customer needs and priorities without a proper product owner leading those efforts.</p>
			<p>Moreover, the development teams may not be allowed to break away from the project-oriented mindset under their organization's traditional funding and resource allocation practices. Agile practices have a product-oriented focus. Executives, customers, and other stakeholders may resist the organizational changes required to support the product-oriented model's iterative development and incremental release strategies. Frankly, Agile and Lean's product and customer-centric focus requires more effort on their part, and they may not see the value.</p>
			<p>The value is there, but the impacted internal organizations and customers need to be educated and see results before buying. So, let's take a moment to discuss how to get their buy-in.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Gaining stakeholder support</h1>
			<p>Agile and Lean practices require more frequent and closer interactions across the business functions, and the participants must have a stake in the success of a new product or product enhancement. In the traditional software development model, management and customer interactions were limited to initial requirements gathering activities and then minimally across periodic milestone reviews, phase gates, and late-stage user acceptance testing. Lean-Agile methodologies are much more demanding.</p>
			<p>Agility benefits come directly from the frequent and continuous team and stakeholder interactions, with complete, accurate, and up-to-date visibility on all critical information. But how do the early adopters encourage others within the organization and their customers to consider such a change?</p>
			<p>The early adopters may <a id="_idIndexMarker216"/>have some success in educating their executives on the benefits of Agile and Lean-Agile practices. However, based on personal observations and experience, the least successful approach is to gain the ear of your executive managers and have them put out a mandate for immediate change. Without proper leadership, guidance, and resources, mandates tend to fail.</p>
			<p>Instead, organizations can follow these practical steps:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Internal promotions</strong>: Create educational materials on proposed Agile or Lean-Agile practices for distribution and review.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Executive sponsor</strong>: Find a key executive sponsor with the authority, funding, and forward-thinking vision to see the benefits of delivering accelerated value.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Internal pilot</strong>: Identify a product with high visibility and the significant potential to serve as an internal pilot and case study.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Pilot team</strong>: Pull together a small team of like-minded early adopters who see the value of Agile and Lean-Agile practices, and who want to be on the leading edge of the change. Also, train the pilot team and other participating stakeholders.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Infrastructure</strong>: Build the infrastructure necessary to support the pilot engagements. Ideally, agile teams operate from a single location with a dedicated meeting room, individual workspaces, laptops and servers, software development and testing tools, and network access.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Plan the pilot experiment</strong>: Plan the activities and schedule to guide the initial pilot through a series of iterations, each delivering incremental value.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Run the pilot experiment</strong>: Run the backlog refinement, plan, development, and test cycles as Agile-based iterations, with each cycle delivering incremental value. Equally as important, ensure the executive leadership, customers, and end users remain committed and actively engaged in each iterative review. Their guidance and input are <a id="_idIndexMarker217"/>critical to the team delivering incremental and customer-centric value.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inspect and adapt</strong>: Throughout the initial pilot engagement, the team and other stakeholders assess their performance through <strong class="bold">retrospectives</strong> and <strong class="bold">product demos</strong>, refine their activities for improvement, execute the planned improvements, monitor, and continue to adapt as necessary. This inspection and adaption process never stops.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">New pilots</strong>: After successfully completing the first pilot, find two to three new pilot projects to further prove and expand the organization's new development approach. Most people want to be part of something successful, and each new pilot success encourages other product teams to evaluate and adopt the approach for their development efforts.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inspect and adapt</strong>: Continuing with the additional pilot engagements, the new teams and associated stakehold<a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>ers assess their performance through retrospectives and product demos, refine their activities for improvement, execute the planned improvements, monitor, and continue to adapt as necessary. The inspection and adaption process never stops.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Roadmap</strong>: As the initial pilots prove the new way of working, the organization's executive leaders must create a detailed roadmap to guide its enterprise-wide deployment. It's impossible to accurately measure, monitor, and guide future deployments without an initial and updated plan from a practical standpoint.<p>It may be necessary to redefine products and product lines under the new model to align with the new Lean value stream model. Such realignment does not affect just the software products. The business needs to evaluate all internal and external customer relationships from a value-adding perspective to define its operational and development-oriented value streams.</p><p>Product teams need to be created, including hiring and mentoring people to serve as <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>product owners and Scrum masters. Training, coaching, and mentoring resources and capabilities need to be developed and deployed to bring employees up to speed on the new Lean-Agile practices. It may be beneficial to establish one or more <strong class="bold">Centers of Excellence</strong> (<strong class="bold">CoE</strong>) to <a id="_idIndexMarker219"/>provide mentoring and coaching resources and guide the value stream transformations.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Rollout</strong>: Execute the deployment plan outlined in the roadmap. Make sure that the appropriate metrics have been defined and monitor progress against those metrics.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inspect and adapt</strong>: Continuing with the rollout, the new teams and associated stakeholders assess their performance through retrospectives and product demos, refine their activities for improvement, execute the planned improvements, monitor, and continue to adapt as necessary. Here, again, this inspection and adaption process never stops.<p>As you can see, inspection and adaption activities prevail throughout the Agile and Lean-Agile transformations and across all product life cycles. Moreover, providing visibility is critical to the inspection and adaptation processes. Metrics and other forms of information help the organization visualize how they are doing against their plans and past performances.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the previous chapter, we learned that the four most critical measures to evaluate team performance are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Deployment frequency</strong>: A measure of team code deployment frequencies into test and production environments</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lead time</strong>: A measure of the time it takes from developers committing their code in the shared repository to successfully running in a production environment</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Mean time to repair or restore (MTTR)</strong>: A measure of how long it takes to restore a service <a id="_idIndexMarker220"/>when a service incident or a defect that impacts users occurs (for example, an unplanned outage or service impairment)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Change fail rate</strong>: A measure of the percentage of changes to production resulting in degraded or failed services (for example, lead to service outage), which then requires remediation (for example, a hotfix or rollback)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, there are other <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>useful measures and information each team may choose to maintain and make visible. For example, <strong class="bold">Intellectsoft</strong> identifies <a id="_idIndexMarker222"/>five categories for Agile measurements and 15 useful metrics that provide a good starting point (<em class="italic">15+ Useful Agile Metrics in Scrum &amp; Kanban: Measure Quality, Productivity &amp; Performance. 2018</em>, which you can refer to at <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/agile-metrics">https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/agile-metrics</a>). VSM vendor <strong class="bold">Plutora</strong> has a <a id="_idIndexMarker223"/>similar article titled <em class="italic">Agile Metrics: The 15 That Actually Matter for Success</em> (<a href="https://www.plutora.com/blog/agile-metrics">https://www.plutora.com/blog/agile-metrics</a>). We'll take a quick look at the metrics presented in these two articles in the next section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Implementing useful metrics</h1>
			<p>Not every Agile or Lean-Agile team <a id="_idIndexMarker224"/>needs the same metrics. Executives and customers will influence choices and likely request information not listed in this subsection. Additionally, product owners may need additional information to understand how the product's architecture, design, and technical depth issues can impact the delivery of identified and prioritized product backlog items.</p>
			<p>The list that follows includes standard metrics that the product teams and their stakeholders may find helpful. The metrics broadly support the primary quality, productivity, and project objectives of Agile, Lean, and Kanban performance measures and software quality measures.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Agile quality metrics</h2>
			<p>The metrics described in <a id="_idIndexMarker225"/>this subsection support generalized quality improvement objectives in Agile-based development practices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Product backlog</strong>: This is a prioritized list of the new features, functions, enhancements, bug fixes, infrastructure changes, or other work items. The quality metrics in this measure deal with the degree to which identified work items are refined and prioritized based on value and delivery costs.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Escaped defects</strong>: This is a measure of the defects that have been released into production that previously passed the team's definition of done. Since total defect prevention is an ideal goal, a high number of escaped defects indicates there are failures in properly defining our acceptance criteria or in our testing capabilities and procedures.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Failed deployments</strong>: This is a measure of how often software deployments into production environments fail and require a rollback. Ideally, the development team's engineering and testing environments, as well as their testing tools and procedures, should capture and address problems that could cause system failures before they're deployed into production.<p>Besides testing to find bugs and nonconformance with the acceptance criteria, the testing environments must accurately mimic the demanded loads against the same combination of applications and configurations within the production environments. Test environments may execute many performance tests, such as load, endurance, volume, scalability, spike, and stress testing. The ideal in DevOps is to automate these and all other tests.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Release Net Promoter Score</strong> (<strong class="bold">NPS</strong>): This is a measure that was initially defined to measure customer experience to predict customer loyalty and business growth. The release-oriented NPS uses directed questions to measure customer satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 10 on each new or major release. In the NPS model, <strong class="bold">detractors</strong> are <a id="_idIndexMarker226"/>customers who respond with a 6 or below on the scale; <strong class="bold">passives</strong> rank the release as a 7 or 8; <strong class="bold">promoters</strong> rank the release in the 9 to 10 range. The NPS calculation measures the percentage of detractors subtracted from the percentage of promoters:<p><img src="image/B17087_02_001.png" alt=""/></p><p><em class="italic">Detractors</em> are a <a id="_idIndexMarker227"/>problem as they are more likely to go with our competitors' offering and criticize our product. <em class="italic">Passives</em> tend to be neither supportive nor unsupportive of the new release. <em class="italic">Promoters</em> often tend to be more <a id="_idIndexMarker228"/>enthusiastic in promoting a company, product, or new release.</p><p>In theory, any <a id="_idIndexMarker229"/>ranking above 0 means the release had more enthusiastic promoters than unhappy detractors. However, organizations should strive to do much better than 0.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59">Agile productivity<a id="_idTextAnchor070"/> metrics</h2>
			<p>The metrics described in this <a id="_idIndexMarker230"/>subsection support productivity improvement objectives in Agile-based development practices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lead time</strong>: As previously noted, this measure spans the time from code commitment to its release into production. It's one of the four metrics that helps assess the effectiveness of a software development team. However, in an Agile context, the lead time is a measure that spans when a user story or work item enters a product backlog to the end of a Sprint or the feature's release into production. The lead time includes the time the work item request waits in the product backlog, as shown in the following diagram:</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer012" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_2.1.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 – Lead time/cycle time diagram&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.1 – Lead time/cycle time diagram</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cycle time (control<a id="_idTextAnchor071"/> chart)</strong>: This is a subcomponent of the lead time and measures how long it takes to complete an activity or set of activities within a value stream. In other words, the cycle time is a measure of the time spent as work in progress, devoid <a id="_idIndexMarker231"/>of all previous wait times. The closer the lead time is to the cycle time, the more efficient the process.<p>The following graph shows an example of a cycle time control chart. In our example, the VSM team collects data on cycle times for specific activities across their pipelines. In our example, the software development team may use VSM tools to capture metrics on how long it takes to conduct a set of end-to-end tests on new increments of code. Regardless, the cycle time control chart includes data points, averages, and established thresholds (limits) for control.</p><p>This type of testing automates the application's workflow from beginning to end, replicating common user scenarios through every possible permutation of operations to discover failures as the application interfaces with hardware, networks, external dependencies, databases, and other applications. The team believes an acceptable cycle time for this test is between 5 to 8 hours, and they usually run these tests at night to avoid software development downtime:</p></li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer013" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_2.2.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2 – Cycle time (control chart)&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.2 – Cycle time (control chart)</p>
			<p>From the preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker232"/>control chart example, we can see that the performance over the past 30 days has not stayed within an acceptable range of 5 to 8 hours (6.5-hour average). Worse, the testing exceeded the allotted 8 hours on six occasions. With this information, the team has the data they need to explore what events caused the lengthy end-to-end testing. They can map this information with the test results from those dates to see what the team can do to prevent such problems in the future.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">In Agile and Lean/Kanban-based systems, the cycle time is a measure of time that a work item <a id="_idIndexMarker233"/>spends as a <strong class="bold">work in progress</strong> (<strong class="bold">WIP</strong>) once the stories have been refined and entered the <em class="italic">in-progress</em> stage. In this context, the cycle time does not include the time the work item spends in ideation through backlog refinements and waiting in the product backlog queue after that. Cycle time starts immediately when the work item is accepted as a work item in the Sprint backlog, or pulled into production in a Lean- or Kanban-based value stream.</p>
			<p>Still, it's possible to <a id="_idIndexMarker234"/>have a cycle time that includes waiting times in Agile, Lean, and Kanban-based systems. The distinction is that the cycle time always includes both <em class="italic">touch</em> and <em class="italic">wait times</em> within Agile-based Sprints, but we'll want to break out and try to eliminate all wait times in a Lean-oriented software value stream.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Wait time</strong>: The amount of time a product or material spends inactive in a <em class="italic">delayed</em> status before work begins. In Lean and Kanban-based systems, we seek to eliminate all wait times.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Sprint Burndown Charts</strong>: A measure and visualization of team forecast velocity as the completion rate, usually in the form of estimated story points, from the Sprint Backlog across one or more Sprints. The primary purpose of a Sprint Burndown Chart is to show the team's progress against the Sprint Goal (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.2</em>).<p>Teams initially forecast the level of effort required from each work item in the form of <em class="italic">story points</em>. A Sprint Burndown Chart tracks progress against the Sprint Backlog regarding the actual number of story points worth of work completed against the planned burndown. There are typically two lines on the chart: one to show the planned velocity and another to show the Sprint's actua<a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>l velocity.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Epic and release burndown/burnup</strong>: The same concept as the Sprint Burndown Chart applies to tracking work progress across defined Epics and product releases. Epics are an enormous scope of planned and interrelated work that's not been refined to smaller stories:</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer014" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_2.3.jpg" alt="Figure 2.3 – One month Sprint Burndown Chart&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.3 – One month Sprint Burndown Chart</p>
			<p>The primary concern with using such metrics is not to use the charts to find faults with a team's progress. The <a id="_idIndexMarker235"/>longer the period and the less defined the requirements, the more difficult it becomes to estimate work with absolute accuracy. Epic and Product Release Burndown Charts merely show progress against initial plans and have nothing to add in the way of understanding why.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Burnup Charts</strong>: Note that we can use the same data that was used to create a Sprint Burndown Chart to visualize the amount of work that was completed throughout the Sprint and how much work remains, as shown here:</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer015" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.4 – Sprint burnup chart</p>
			<p>Note that the <a id="_idIndexMarker236"/>smaller dotted line in the preceding diagram indicates the originally planned projection of work that's been completed. In our example, the team is on target to complete the initially estimated 300 points worth of work early.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Velocity</strong>: This is the measure of estimated work a team or teams accomplish over time, usually measured across each Sprint in Agile:</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer016" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_2.5.jpg" alt="Figure 2.5 – Scrum Team velocity chart&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.5 – Scrum Team velocity chart</p>
			<p>The objective is to use the velocity chart to judge future performance. However, the more significant the <a id="_idIndexMarker237"/>variance in this number, the more difficult the team or teams will have estimating the scope of work within the product and Sprint backlogs, and the more difficult it will be to plan their deliveries.</p>
			<p>In DevOps within large organizations, velocity measures the number of stories completed in days or even hours.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Control charts</strong>: Also known as Shewhart charts (named after Walter A. Shewhart), this is a statistical process control tool that's used to determine if a process is in a state of control. In Agile and Lean development practices, teams use control charts to track the duration of tasks from <em class="italic">in progress</em> to <em class="italic">completion</em>:</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer017" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_2.6.jpg" alt="Figure 2.6 – Process control chart&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.6 – Process control chart</p>
			<p>In an ideal world, all activities would be very predictable and never vary from a desirable mean. However, that's rarely the case, and we use control charts to see if our processes are trending in the wrong direction. Control charts have upper and lower boundaries that define optimal durations and upper and lower control limits to indicate an out of bounds measurement. When the teams see their metrics trending toward the upper or lower control boundary limits, they know they have issues to address.</p>
			<p>A typical use case for control charts is showing the rate of defects over instances of an activity or process. However, when <a id="_idIndexMarker238"/>used to measure activity durations, control charts help show the team's velocity and its trend in velocity.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Agile project metrics</h2>
			<p>The metrics described in this <a id="_idIndexMarker239"/>subsection support how  workflows are managed in Agile-based development practices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kanban Boards and Cards</strong>: Kanban is a "Pull" signaling system that was initially developed to support Lean-oriented and <strong class="bold">just-in-time</strong> (<strong class="bold">JIT</strong>) manufacturing <a id="_idIndexMarker240"/>concepts in Japan. Kanban stands for Kan (that is, card) and Ban (that is, signal), which, when interpreted together, mean <em class="italic">billboard</em> or <em class="italic">signboard</em>. In a Kanban system, no production process starts until receipt of the signal card indicates the desired quantity and type of parts or work required. The entire value stream process only kicks off on-demand with customer orders.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Visualize the workflow</strong>: Teams can employ whiteboards with columns to indicate the team's defined stages of work. Using an IT example, those stages might include <em class="italic">Backlog</em>, <em class="italic">Refinement</em>, <em class="italic">Development and Test</em>, <em class="italic">Acceptance</em>, and <em class="italic">Delivery</em>.<p>The following image shows an example of a Kanban Board with Kanban Cards indicating work in progress across the Story, To Do, In Progress, To Verify, and Done value stream activities:</p></li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer018" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_2.7.jpg" alt="Figure 2.7 – Kanban Board with Kanban Cards&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.7 – Kanban Board with Kanban Cards</p>
			<p>In the preceding image, the labels map to the Agile pipeline Kanban activities managed by the <a id="_idIndexMarker241"/>software development team. Stories are the user stories that are managed in the product backlog. The to-do list is the highest priority user story. In Progress includes the user stories under development. To Verify includes the user stories that are complete but need to be verified by their team members and product owner. Finally, Done represents the user stories that can be released into production.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Limit work in progress (WIP)</strong>: Ideally, there should never be a queue of work or materials except in the initial product backlog. Downstream processes only pull work when they have the capacity to perform the work. Without this simple rule, work and materials accumulate at the slower processes within the pipeline, which we know creates waste due to excessive storage requirements and carrying costs. Additionally, excessive WIP hides bugs and defects in the queued products. These become increasingly challenging to find and expensive <a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>to fix later.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Manage flow</strong>: Use Kanban Cards as signaling devices to indicate new requests from internal and external customers. These Cards enter a queue on the Kanban Board. As downstream capacity opens to take on work from the previous stage, the individuals taking on the work move the card they selected into the next column on the board to indicate they have accepted the work. In other words, work is only pulled into downstream processes when capacity is available; work is never pushed to a downstream process.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Make policies explicit</strong>: Organizations must provide simple, clear, and visible policies describing desired work practices, approved technologies, procurement processes, and human <a id="_idIndexMarker242"/>resource management. The policies must evolve based on new learning that suggests better approaches.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Feedback</strong>: Feedback in Kanban comes through collaborative meetings. Traditional Kanban practices implement seven types of meetings:<p>a. <strong class="bold">Strategy review</strong>: These are corporate-level assessments of the business mission, goals, and objectives constrained by resources, time, competition, and technologies.</p><p>b. <strong class="bold">Operations review</strong>: They help teams assess their Kanban practices, value stream activities, and resources to deliver value.</p><p>c. <strong class="bold">Risk review</strong>: Identify risks and develop mitigation strategies and contingency plans.</p><p>d. <strong class="bold">Service delivery review</strong>: Assessment of the services required to support product deliveries (also known as operational value streams).</p><p>e. <strong class="bold">Replenishment meeting</strong>: This is a Kanban-based form of backlog management activity that's used to identify the tasks that must be pulled from the backlog. This is done by <a id="_idIndexMarker243"/>assigning the tasks to a <strong class="bold">Class of Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">CoS</strong>) and setting limits for the number of tasks that are pulled from each CoS. Examples of CoS tasks include emergency requests, fixed delivery dates, bugs, standard tasks, and maintenance tasks.</p><p>f. <strong class="bold">Kanban standup meeting</strong>: This is similar in concept to the Daily Scrum Meeting, where team members meet briefly to discuss how the work is progressing, what work remains, and what's getting in the way of our work. The Kanban meeting's primary difference is managing work as a continuous flow, minimizing lead times by eliminating bottlenecks, and reducing WIP. Team members meet at their Kanban Board.</p><p>g. <strong class="bold">Delivery planning meeting</strong>: This is required when organizations formally release products on fixed dates. The delivery planning meetings help teams address implementation concerns, support and maintenance hand-offs, data migrations, training <a id="_idIndexMarker244"/>development and delivery requirements, and other <strong class="bold">service-level agreement</strong> (<strong class="bold">SLA</strong>) issues.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Continuous improvements (Kaizen)</strong>: Ideas for improvement come from observation, collaborations, retrospectives, and product demos. Use team-based retrospectives to <a id="_idIndexMarker245"/>review and analyze previous issues, implement immediate experiments to resolve those issues, and never stop these iterative efforts for continuous improvements. Moreover, use customer demos to help guide development priorities from their perspective.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cumulative flow diagram (CFD)</strong>: This is an <a id="_idIndexMarker246"/>analytical tool that's typically associated with the Kanban method. Similar conceptually to Agile's Burnup Charts, the CFD provides visibility on the amount of accumulative work across each stage of a value stream (for example, a software development value stream).<p>In an ideal world, work items flow through a sequence of activities in a synchronized and coordinated development pipeline with slight variance on activity durations, no rework, and no losses due to defects and bugs. But we don't live in that world, and stuff happens that causes work accumulations at various points of our development pipeline.</p><p>The following graph shows a CFD tracking work across the following four stages of a software delivery pipeline:</p><p>a. Work item requests (blue)</p><p>b. Requirements refined (orange)</p><p>c. Development and testing WIP (gray)</p><p>d. Delivery (yellow):</p></li>
			</ul>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.8 – Continuous Flow Diagram (CFD)</p>
			<p>The CFD allows <a id="_idIndexMarker247"/>teams to visualize potential impediments in their value stream process and the most effective tool to observe the impacts across the value stream's activities. Instead of a relatively smooth graph with gentle rises and falls, sudden ascending or descending graphics indicate impediments.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Code Coverage</strong>: This is a measure and visual display of how much of a team's product code is covered by unit tests or test suites. Typical code coverage metrics include method or function coverage, statement coverage, branch coverage, condition coverage, <strong class="bold">multiple condition/decision coverage</strong> (<strong class="bold">MC/DC</strong>), parameter <a id="_idIndexMarker248"/>coverage, and cyclomatic complexity.<p>The more extensive the code coverage in testing, the higher the software's potential reliability and quality. Any gaps in code coverage can result in software failures and bugs. And <a id="_idIndexMarker249"/>even if your team has high code coverage, there's always a chance something can slip through the cracks. On the other hand, with good code coverage, those instances should be few and far between.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>Health metrics for Agile teams/Agile performance metrics</h2>
			<p>The metrics <a id="_idIndexMarker250"/>described in this subsection support employee satisfaction objectives in Lean and Agile-based development practices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Employee happiness</strong>: This is a somewhat subjective measurement but ultimately critical to keeping your employees in the long run. Happiness is measured through simple employee surveys, asking them to rate how happy they are with the company, what they like best, what they don't like, and what would increase their happiness. Of course, executive leaders need to proactively act on this information to produce positive changes that help keep and attract talented workers.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Team morale</strong>: Measures of team-level morale often provide better indicators of job satisfaction. Again, surveys work best, but the questions are not open-ended. Instead, the surveys ask the team members to rate their agreement with the questions on a scale of 1 to 7. The questions ask whether the team member feels they are a good fit for the team, are proud of their work, enthusiastic about their work, and find meaning and purpose in their work.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>Core Lean and Kanban metrics</h2>
			<p>The metrics <a id="_idIndexMarker251"/>described in this <a id="_idIndexMarker252"/>subsection support productivity improvement objectives in Lean software development practices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Story lead time</strong>: This lead time metric shows up again, but this time in the context of Lean and Kanban systems. Since Lean and Kanban implement value stream flows, the lead time for a story starts when it enters the product backlog and completes when completed. Thus, lead times always include the wait time when products and materials sit in a queue.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Story cycle time</strong>: A component of lead time, cycle times measure how long it takes to complete the set of activities within a value stream. In a DevOps context, this is a pipeline flow measurement of the time it takes for work to flow through the team's development pipeline. Specifically, the lead time spans work item creation to completion, while the cycle time measures the duration a work item spends as work in process.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Feature lead time</strong>: This is a variation on story lead time, where the focus is on implementing specific features. User stories represent a user or customer's desired capabilities, which can be quite granular in scope. For example, a user story for an online car buyer might state, "<em class="italic">As a car buyer, I want to view the color of the dealer's available automobile so that I can see any match my color preferences.</em>" From this example, it's clear that user stories are statements of requirements from the user's perspective.<p>In contrast, a feature implements a slice of business functionality that may encompass multiple user story requests. In this context, the dealer's online feature might include all customer online automobile lookup preferences, including make, model, year, price, color, and other differentiating options. In other words, a feature is the implementation of a piece of functionality from the point of view of the business.</p><p>Making the distinction between user stories and product features is essential as customers buy capabilities and may not know what capabilities and benefits a feature provide unless clearly stated. Recall our previous discussion on the need to clearly state a product's capabilities and benefits via its value proposition.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Feature cycle time</strong>: Similar to the story cycle time, this is the total time involved when developers actively design, develop, and test the feature. In other words, cycle times measure the time of the work in progress.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Story wait time</strong>: This is a measure of non-value-added time that a product requirement or work in progress sits in an idle state. The goal is to minimize wait times to the greatest extent possible.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Story throughput</strong>: This measure of velocity calculates the number of stories running through development pipeline (or other value stream) over time. Smaller stories help improve throughput in two ways. First, smaller stories are quicker to implement because there is less work to complete. Second, smaller stories tend to be less complicated and, therefore, easier and quicker to debug discovered errors.<p>It is essential to keep your stories relatively consistent in size in a Lean- or Kanban-based environment. In a Lean-based system, the objective is to have matched activity durations to prevent queuing in slower activities. Of course, using a pull-based order entry system tied to available capacity also helps minimize queuing.</p><p>Also, recall that any value stream's ideal cycle rate is the available production time divided by customer requests <a id="_idIndexMarker253"/>within the same duration (also known as <strong class="bold">TAKT time</strong>). So, if your software development teams are receiving an average of 10 stories across each 8-hour day, the TAKT time is <img src="image/B17087_02_002.png" alt=""/></p><p>In other words, the activities within your DevOps- or Kanban-based development pipeline need to cycle at the same rate as order entries. If you go slower than TAKT time, you won't deliver all your customers' orders; if you operate faster, you produce unrequested products.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Created-to-finished ratio</strong>: This is a measure of the difference between the number of work items entering your value stream compared to the number of items completed over time. Queues develop when the number of work items entering that value stream exceeds the number completed, assuming the work is entered into the product backlog.<p>If the order entry level is stable, the dev teams may address the issues by streamlining their value stream activities or adding capacity. However, it may also be possible that some of the stories are not of sufficient priority or cost-justified to include in the product backlog queue. Regardless, an excessive created-to-finish ratio indicates lost opportunity when the work is a customer priority and has been cost-justified.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>Measuring software quality in Agile</h2>
			<p>The metrics described in <a id="_idIndexMarker254"/>this subsection support software <a id="_idIndexMarker255"/>quality improvement objectives in Agile-based development practices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Static code analysis</strong>: This is a method that's used to debug software. It does so by examining source code against a predefined set of rules and standards without executing the program. Developers conduct static code analysis in the earliest code development phases, before unit testing, or before integrating with the source code repository's mainline code. The objective is to find and fix coding errors at the earliest time possible.<p>It's possible to run static code analysis as a manual test. But manual testing is time-consuming, laborious, and subject to human error. The better approach is to use a <strong class="bold">static code analysis tool</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAST</strong>) to <a id="_idIndexMarker256"/>scan and check compliance to coding rules such as syntax violations, undefined values, dead or unused code, programming errors, security, vulnerabilities, performance issues, and others. The output of a SAST is a summary report showing the health status of your code.</p><p>While there are numerous open source and commercial SASTs, modern compilers also perform syntactic or technical errors before running the code, catching many of the same types of errors.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Dynamic code analysis</strong>: This identifies defects after compiling the code and running it across the product testing life cycle, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing, and regression testing. Dynamic code analysis aims to check the system's response to variables that dynamically change within the application.<p>The primary benefit of <a id="_idIndexMarker257"/>dynamic code testing is that the <a id="_idIndexMarker258"/>tests operate against many orders of magnitude greater numbers of permutations of data inputs than humans can manually implement, within the same time frame. For example, dynamic code analysis might involve tens of thousands or more data input configurations, operating against multiple components and integrated systems, in a batch run that lasts a few hours.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Quality intelligence</strong>: Data analysis tools help improve software development processes that produce poor or undesirable quality outcomes. Static and dynamic analysis tools focus on identifying issues with code already under development. However, quality intelligence aims to discover the areas in the development process that consistently produce problems in terms of velocity, quality, and efficiencies. Quality intelligence tools help teams organize and analyze data from activities across the entire software development life cycle.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This section ends our discussion on useful Lean-Agile metrics. In the next section, you will learn how to improve IT flows by implementing Lean production and operations practices across the IT organization.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>Improving IT flows through Lean Thinking</h1>
			<p>In the next chapter, you <a id="_idIndexMarker259"/>will learn how to apply Systems Thinking to <a id="_idIndexMarker260"/>reduce complexity across six potential value streams involving one to six sets of activities (See <em class="italic">Figure 3.2</em>, an image showing nodes, potential connections, actual connections, and network densities.) The graphic provided demonstrates how aligning value stream activities as streamlined flows reduces the number of possible connections and interactions across the activities. Thus, the linear-sequential approach is the most efficient way to operate within a value stream.</p>
			<p>However, we can still mess things up by not reducing the setup and cycle times of lengthier activities and allowing work items to queue at those slower activities within the value stream. As noted previously, the ideal goal is to match each activity and the overall production rates to the rate of receiving customer orders or requirements. We can calculate this as the time to produce work items, divided by the number of items requested over the interval, otherwise <a id="_idIndexMarker261"/>known as <strong class="bold">Takt time</strong>.</p>
			<p>Conceptually, Lean production eliminates all forms of waste that hinder our efforts to deliver customer-centric value. In the traditional view of Lean manufacturing, there are seven distinct categories of waste, as shown in the following list:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Waiting</strong>: Delays in processing, including any time products spend waiting or in a queue.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Overproduction</strong>: Producing more of something than you need or than your customer's currently want.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Extra-processing</strong>: Over-processing or conducting any non-value-added activity.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Transportation</strong>: Wasted time, resources, and costs moving products and materials from one location to another.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Motion</strong>: Unnecessary movement, motion, or activities performed by people.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inventory</strong>: Carrying and storing any materials and products not undergoing a value-added activity.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Defects</strong>: Any defects in the product or services produced.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The previous list of waste in Lean evolved primarily in the manufacturing industry, though it also <a id="_idIndexMarker262"/>supports services-oriented companies, such as <a id="_idIndexMarker263"/>software development companies. Waste in software development practices is the topic of the next section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>Eliminating waste in software development</h1>
			<p>In 2003, Mary and Tom Poppendieck released their book <em class="italic">Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit</em>, where they discussed applying Lean manufacturing concepts to software development. Their <a id="_idIndexMarker264"/>book maps <a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>seven forms of waste in software development back to the original Lean concepts of waste, as shown in the following table:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer021" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_2.9.jpg" alt="Figure 2.9 – Mapping Lean Manufacturing waste to its software development equivalents&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.9 – Mapping Lean Manufacturing waste to its software development equivalents</p>
			<p>These definitions of waste in Lean production and Lean software development have been around for 3 and nearly 2 decades, respectively. Since then, a great deal of thinking has evolved around Lean practices, which I addressed in my previous book, <em class="italic">Scaling Scrum Across Modern Enterprises</em>. For expedience, I'll recap the primary concept here in this section. However, I encourage those who want a deeper dive to explore the two chapters from my previous book devoted to this subject: <a href="B17087_05_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor126"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Driving Business Value through a DevOps Pipeline</em>, and <a href="B17087_06_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Launching the VSM Initiative (VSM Steps 1-3)</em>.</p>
			<p>As you read through <a id="_idIndexMarker266"/>the following list of <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>Lean concepts, understand that they apply equally well to the development of physical, digital, and hybrid-physical-digital products and services:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Value</strong>: Customers always define value. It doesn't matter how much experience we have or how bright we are; any idea we come up with is, at best, a risk until adequately validated by the target customers.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Continuous improvements (Kaizen)</strong>: The goal is to make work more efficient and effective through teamwork, improved procedures, and employee and customer collaboration. The tools for continuous improvement include quality control mechanisms, just-in-time delivery, standardized work, fast setups, streamlined flows, more efficient equipment, and waste elimination. Additionally, improvements should help make the employee's jobs more fulfilling, less fatiguing, and safer.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Visual controls</strong>: This involves controls such as Kanban Cards to manage the intake of work items to match value stream flows. Control charts are another form of chart that help us see when we are trending out of bounds on any metrics.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Built-in quality</strong>: This means finding problems and fixing them immediately when they're introduced. In the continuous flows of a lean system, we may have to stop all the work in the value stream and focus everyone's efforts on resolving the problem quickly. Building in quality helps us eliminate the higher costs that result from product recalls, rework, and the lengthy process of finding and fixing bugs in the late stages of product development.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improving knowledge</strong>: This is an essential element of continuous improvements in Lean and Agile practices. Whether we learn from experience, by trial and error, or by learning from others, we can apply that learning to evolve new ways of working that are more effective and productive. Teams must make time for observations, analysis, and learning.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Delay decisions and commitments</strong>: Though seemingly counterintuitive to lean principles, there are costs involved when making poor decisions due to insufficient information. It's better to delay decisions until we have enough information to <a id="_idIndexMarker268"/>mitigate <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>our risks. In the long run, the organization saves time and money by building the products that customers want and value, not what we think they want.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Detect defects through automation (Jidoka)</strong>: The Japanese Lean concept of autonomation means <em class="italic">Automation with a human touch</em>. Jidoka is a quality control principle that recommends using automated techniques to detect abnormalities, stop the process, fix the immediate problem, and then identify the cause and effects and explore ways to prevent or reduce future occurrences.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Eliminate mistakes (Poka-Yoke)</strong>: This is also known as <em class="italic">mistake-proofing</em>. This approach to eliminating wastes prevents incorrect operations being performed by employees or product users. The objective is to design a process or mechanism that makes it impossible to perform a particular activity incorrectly. For example, a team's <strong class="bold">continuous integration</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI</strong>) practices might implement a <a id="_idIndexMarker270"/>build process that automatically performs static analysis and test-driven development instructions. The CI automation process helps ensure a developer's code meets the organization's coding practices and customer's acceptance requirements, before they are allowed to integrate their code with the main branch (also known as the master branch).</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Eliminate waste</strong>: Assess and eliminate the seven forms of waste, as identified in previously, for Lean production and software development.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Quit multitasking/task switching</strong>: Because such activities break our attention and focus on what we are currently doing, this forces our brains to switch between tasks rapidly. In reality, multitasking is a form of task switching. In other words, when multitasking, you are not thinking about both topics at the same time. Instead, you are switching your attention back and forth between them.<p>Multitasking only <a id="_idIndexMarker271"/>works for a limited set of activities that split our cognitive activities across our <a id="_idIndexMarker272"/>brains' left and right prefrontal cortexes, such as talking while walking with a friend. Moreover, multitasking only works while performing a relatively autonomous motor skill with a cognitive task – and even then, you are likely to do both tasks slower.</p><p>When working across multiple cognitive tasks, our thinking involves a sequential switching process that creates a bottleneck when switching between cognitive tasks. While switching between topics, our brains require time and effort to reorient our thinking and pick back up where we left off, and we lose information in the process. As a result, we lose our train of thought, and it takes us longer to complete our thoughts and work.</p><p>But there are other undesirable effects of multitasking and task switching, including making mistakes, adding to your stress, disrupting your short-term memory, and missing essential details as you switch between tasks. Task switching also negatively impacts creativity, and you may end up revisiting a subject multiple times to get through the task.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Practice Gemba (that is, go to the source)</strong>: This helps you see your current situation. When applied to Lean production, managers walk the manufacturing floors to review progress and talk to the workers to discuss their issues and concerns. In a software development context, we have collocated teams, and we use daily scrums and other events to communicate progress, issues, and ideas. Big charts are made visible in the development operations and updated frequently to simplify communications to anyone who needs or wants to know how things are going.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Implement single-piece flows</strong>: This is ideal in Lean production and lean software development practices. This concept extends our discussions on why the most efficient value streams instill a linear-sequential set of activities to streamline workflows. The other killer of productivity is batch processing, which is made worse when batch processes between activities and activity durations do not match.<p>Intuitively, it seems <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>that large batch processes are less costly as they can work on hundreds of items in <a id="_idIndexMarker274"/>one batch. However, in real life, the cost savings are lost from lengthy wait times, excessive product changeover times across production equipment, and hiding bugs and defects in large batches.</p><p>The ideal situation is to have the flow of one work item for each value stream activity. There should be lengthy setup or changeover requirements. Activity cycle times should be the lowest time possible and matched across all value stream activities. Finally, production throughput for the value stream should equal the rate of order entries (that is, takt time).</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Level workloads (Heijunka)</strong>: We must have a goal to prevent large batches of orders or requests from entering a system that causes waiting and other resulting problems. Heijunka involves leveling the type and quantity of production across a fixed time.<p>In a Lean software development context, we can use an example of a product owner receiving requirements that vary from day to day, depending on sources and product management activities that provide information. However, for this example, let's assume that the overall demand stays relatively constant at approximately 25 new high-priority requirements a week, even if they don't come in at a constant rate of five per day.</p><p>Assuming our Lean development shop can handle the load of five work items per day, the product owner maintains a product backlog with a sufficient inventory to maintain a stable release of five work items a day. The volume of new requests may vary from day to day, but the goal is to maintain a steady flow of new work items into production.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Pull production systems</strong>: Enforce rules to only produce goods in direct response to demand, instead of building products or features early and creating waste in the form of unsold inventories of products and features customers may never want. The lean value stream doesn't initiate work in a pull-oriented production system until it contains a customer order or requirement. The Kanban system is a method that's used to enforce the discipline of the pull-oriented production system across the entire value stream.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Just-in-time (JIT) deliveries</strong>: This is another strategy that matches production rates to customer demand and eliminates all waste in activities that do not add value across the production processes. However, JIT initially dealt with inventory management problems. Rather than ordering and storing batches of materials, JIT only allows new procurement and material deliveries that match customer demands. Moreover, the producers schedule their materials to arrive just as they are needed to manufacture the ordered products.<p>JIT works in a digital context in several ways. First, software development teams don't start work on new features or functions until there is customer demand. Moreover, when digital products support other organizational value streams, we need to make sure the deliveries align with the consuming value streams' needs.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Optimize the whole</strong>: This is another way to aggregate the concepts noted in the single-piece flows, leveling workloads, pull production systems, and JIT subsections. The objective is to look at the entire value stream to simplify and reduce complexity and eliminate waste. Aim to make your production processes as efficient and streamlined as possible. Rather than fighting fires, only allow orders or requirements to flow into a system at the received rate. And never allow new orders to enter faster than your production system can handle the load as a continuous and uninterrupted flow without waiting.<p>Our value streams represent an approach to simplifying complex production and operations-oriented systems, while simultaneously ensuring we stay focused on adding or improving customer-centric value. In this context, a value stream is an end-to-end optimization of an entire (that is, the whole) complex development or operations-oriented system.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reject unfinished work</strong>: In a Lean software development context, this is any work in progress that's been promoted into production that's not yet met its <em class="italic">definition of done</em>. However, unfinished <a id="_idIndexMarker275"/>work creates havoc at all stages of a value stream. If developers or other workers feel pressured into sending their work <a id="_idIndexMarker276"/>before completion, the potential downstream effects include additional bugs, defects, failures, rework, delays, and unsatisfied customers. As a matter of policy, organizations should never allow downstream value stream activities to accept unfinished work from upstream activities.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Respect for people</strong>: This should be an obvious requirement for building effective organizations. However, hierarchical and bureaucratic organizations often create hostile environments that do not encourage cross-team or cross-organizational communications and collaborations. In addition, such processes create stress when problems arise outside the bounds of the process and through the delays of getting appropriate responses and approvals across the hierarchy.<p>Both the Agile and Lean practices promote the need for respect with accountability. These concepts are different than the "Golden Rule" concept you were taught as a child – <em class="italic">"Treat others as you would have them treat you</em>."</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's quickly review how the Golden Rule plays out in Lean-oriented software development:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Work regular hours, eliminate overtime, and maintain a sustainable pace.</li>
				<li>Help team members understand the value they provide to customers.</li>
				<li>Build compensation and incentives plans around continuous learning and skills.</li>
				<li>Challenge team members without belittling them.</li>
				<li>Hold teams, not individuals, accountable for their commitments.</li>
				<li>Implement safe working environments so that team members are not punished for seeking help when problems arise.</li>
				<li>Involve <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>team members in <a id="_idIndexMarker278"/>analyzing problems, exploring cause and effect, and coming up with methods to resolve the issues at hand.</li>
				<li>Remove impediments to minimize frustration.</li>
				<li>While seeking stability, also provide variety to prevent boredom.</li>
				<li>Protect the organizational knowledge base by developing stable personnel, promotions based on demonstrable development of relevant knowledge and skills, and meticulous succession plans.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We have reached the end of this section on Lean Thinking. In summary, Lean Thinking is about organizing work around value (products, services, information) and streamlining work and information flows. So far, you have learned how to evaluate value streams through Systems Thinking with causal loop diagrams. This helps evaluate the interconnected relationships of nodes or elements participating in a value stream system.</p>
			<p>In <a href="B17087_07_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor183"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Mapping the Current State (VSM Step 4)</em>, and <a href="B17087_08_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor209"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Identifying Lean Metrics (VSM Step 5)</em>, you will learn how to use value stream mapping to assess current as-is value stream activities and evaluate <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>alternate to-be <a id="_idIndexMarker280"/>states to improve value across the value streams. But before we move on, let's take a quick look at how organizations blend Lean and Agile concepts.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>Creating the Lean-Agile foundation</h1>
			<p>This section is about <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>blending Agile and Lean concepts and practices. At first glance, both Agile and Lean practices have similar goals of improving customer value, but both development philosophies seem to approach that primary goal differently. So, the question then is, how do we blend the best of both approaches to make something better?</p>
			<p>Earlier in this chapter, you learned that Agile is a set of values and principles, typically implemented as an iterative and incremental process, that deliver customer-centric value. The basic idea is that Agile teams create the most value for their customers when they have the flexibility to incrementally deliver small chunks of value with frequent customer and user reviews. This helps ensure the product stays aligned with current needs and priorities. You also learned that Scrum is an Agile-based methodology that implements a framework of empiricism. This encourages teams to try out different ideas and use their experiences and observations to uncover better ways of doing things.</p>
			<p>In contrast, Lean seeks to improve customer-centric value by eliminating all waste forms and only doing what customers want. Some Lean practitioners like to think of the Lean concept of waste as avoiding spending time and effort on activities that customers don't want to pay. The challenge with that thinking is that it's a bit shortsighted. For example, an  organization may spend money on infrastructure, training, and process improvements that indirectly provide more value for the customer, even though the immediate customer might not benefit from those investments.</p>
			<p>Knowing that both the Agile and Lean methodologies primary focus on creating customer value, the primary difference is the development intervals. Agile practitioners tend to think in terms of small teams providing new value incrementally across small iterative releases. Though the iterative release may be relatively small and frequent, especially compared to the traditional Waterfall model, each Agile Sprint is still a batch process.</p>
			<p>One effective way to make Agile practices leaner is to replace the Sprint iteration model with a Kanban-based pull model. This strategy limits the work in progress to a minimal number of work items and simultaneously replaces the Sprint batch process with single-piece workflows.</p>
			<p>But Kanbans are <a id="_idIndexMarker282"/>manual processes, and we can do better. For example, we can make additional improvements by streamlining, integrating, and automating our IT processes to achieve the full benefits of Lean. That is the topic of the next section on accelerating flows.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>Accelerating flows across IT value streams</h1>
			<p>In the previous section, you learned that Agile and Lean aim to improve customer value and manage <a id="_idIndexMarker283"/>product flows differently. You also learned that the quickest and simplest way to blend Agile and Lean practices is by moving away <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>from the batch Sprint model, to a continuous flow model by using Kanban Boards and Cards. However, we can also streamline and accelerate our <a id="_idIndexMarker285"/>value delivery processes <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/>through integration and automation strategies. <strong class="bold">Continuous integration</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI</strong>), <strong class="bold">continuous delivery</strong> (<strong class="bold">CD</strong>), DevOps, platforms, and software factories help us achieve these goals.</p>
			<p>First, CI and CD capabilities help the IT development teams streamline, integrate, and automate <a id="_idIndexMarker287"/>their <strong class="bold">software development life cycle</strong> (<strong class="bold">SDLC</strong>) processes. That's not to say that the entire set of SDLC processes should be streamlined, integrated, and automated all at once. Rapid adoption may not be possible for a small IT shop or a small team within a larger organization that has not implemented DevOps platforms or software factories. But the eventual end-to-end streamlining, integration, and automation of the software development value stream is the ideal goal from a Lean perspective.</p>
			<p>With CI/CD capabilities, DevOps takes the Lean concepts as integrated value streams into the IT operation's functionality. Specifically, the IT organization can implement value stream management capabilities to integrate front and backend processes. Again, attempting to manage all these changes at once is not practical for most organizations. However, the ideal objective is to reach such a stage of integrated capabilities as quickly as possible.</p>
			<p>Streaming, integrating, and automating end-to-end CI/CD and DevOps processes help the IT organization accelerate value deliveries. They also help improve the quality of the delivered products and services. In <em class="italic">Section 2</em> (<a href="B17087_06_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Launching the VSM Initiative (VSM Steps 1-3)</em>, through <a href="B17087_10_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor272"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Improving the Lean-Agile Value Delivery Cycle(VSM Steps 7 and 8)</em>) of this book, you will learn how value stream management helps marshal value delivery from concept through delivery and support, while simultaneously tying its business value delivery objectives to its software delivery capabilities.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Section 3</em> (<a href="B17087_11_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor291"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Identifying VSM Tool Types and Capabilities</em>, through <a href="B17087_14_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor411"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introducing the Enterprise Lean-VSM Practice Leaders</em>) identifies the leading VSM tool vendors and methodologists. The <a id="_idIndexMarker288"/>VSM methodologists are <a id="_idIndexMarker289"/>split into two camps: those that implement VSM to support digital business transformations and those that support the general implementation of lean practices.</p>
			<p>Finally, <em class="italic">Section 4</em> (<a href="B17087_15_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor446"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></a>, <em class="italic">Avoiding DevOps Implementation Pitfalls</em>, through <em class="italic">Chapter 17</em>, <em class="italic">Conclusion – Enabling Lean Business Transformations</em>) of this book discusses using a DevOps platform or software factory strategies to expedite the organization's efforts to streamline, integrate, and automate DevOps processes as part of a business transformation. DevOps platforms are commercial offerings that contain integrated DevOps toolchains that development teams can use with minimal challenges. The potential downside is the limitations of the tools that have been adopted or developed by the platform provider.</p>
			<p>An alternative approach is to have an internal or external IT development organization build software factories that implement fully configured DevOps toolchains as code. With modern tools and managed configurations as code, a team can download and stand up a fully provisioned DevOps environment on demand and in minutes.</p>
			<p>With this, we will conclude our chapter.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you learned how Agile established values and principles to improve software development practices and how Scrum became the prevalent Agile methodology. Scrum implements an Agile framework that incorporates empiricism to help small teams evolve their development practices and products through observation and experimentation. We touched on Systems Thinking to understand the software value stream as a complex mixture of elements that form complex relationships. These relationships make it difficult to understand how the interacting parts respond to changes in variables within the system. Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) gives us a tool to analyze the system-wide impacts of those types of complex interactions.</p>
			<p>This chapter also introduced you to the Lean Thinking and Lean software development concepts to add value by streamlining, integrating, and automating value stream activities and pulling in work matched with demands and production capacities. Finally, you learned how to blend Lean and Agile concepts and then accelerate value across your IT value streams.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, you will learn how to evaluate complex systems in terms of the participating elements and their interrelationships.</p>
