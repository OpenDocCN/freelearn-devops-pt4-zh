- en: The IT industry undergoes constant evolution to deliver customer-centric value
    more quickly and efficiently and with higher quality. Some improvement concepts,
    such as Agile and DevOps, came directly from the software industry. However, Lean,
    Systems Thinking, and Value Stream Management all have their origins outside the
    software industry. Still, all these practices are now mainstream in the software
    and digital products and services delivery industries.

- en: Though this book is about applying VSM and DevOps practices to accelerate digital
    value delivery, it's essential that each organization establishes a base of foundational
    practices. Specifically, IT organizations need to build their VSM and DevOps capabilities
    upon a solid value-centric foundation of Agile, Lean, and Systems Thinking practices.

    the undesirable outcomes of flawed processes. Undesirable outcomes include building
    products with features and functions that customers don't want, delivering inferior

    It makes no sense for a single Agile methodology to try to force a particular
    development strategy. Instead, the Scrum Framework guides the team's use of their

    mapping to assess current as-is value stream activities and evaluate alternate
    to-be states to improve value across the value streams. But before we move on,
    let's take a quick look at how organizations blend Lean and Agile concepts.
  prefs: []

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This section is about blending Agile and Lean concepts and practices. At first
    glance, both Agile and Lean practices have similar goals of improving customer
    value, but both development philosophies seem to approach that primary goal differently.
    So, the question then is, how do we blend the best of both approaches to make
    something better?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Earlier in this chapter, you learned that Agile is a set of values and principles,
    typically implemented as an iterative and incremental process, that deliver customer-centric
    value. The basic idea is that Agile teams create the most value for their customers
    when they have the flexibility to incrementally deliver small chunks of value
    with frequent customer and user reviews. This helps ensure the product stays aligned
    with current needs and priorities. You also learned that Scrum is an Agile-based
    methodology that implements a framework of empiricism. This encourages teams to
    try out different ideas and use their experiences and observations to uncover
    better ways of doing things.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast, Lean seeks to improve customer-centric value by eliminating all
    waste forms and only doing what customers want. Some Lean practitioners like to
    think of the Lean concept of waste as avoiding spending time and effort on activities
    that customers don't want to pay. The challenge with that thinking is that it's
    a bit shortsighted. For example, an organization may spend money on infrastructure,
    training, and process improvements that indirectly provide more value for the
    customer, even though the immediate customer might not benefit from those investments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Knowing that both the Agile and Lean methodologies primary focus on creating
    customer value, the primary difference is the development intervals. Agile practitioners
    tend to think in terms of small teams providing new value incrementally across
    small iterative releases. Though the iterative release may be relatively small
    and frequent, especially compared to the traditional Waterfall model, each Agile
    Sprint is still a batch process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One effective way to make Agile practices leaner is to replace the Sprint iteration
    model with a Kanban-based pull model. This strategy limits the work in progress
    to a minimal number of work items and simultaneously replaces the Sprint batch
    process with single-piece workflows.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But Kanbans are manual processes, and we can do better. For example, we can
    make additional improvements by streamlining, integrating, and automating our
    IT processes to achieve the full benefits of Lean. That is the topic of the next

    value and manage product flows differently. You also learned that the quickest
    and simplest way to blend Agile and Lean practices is by moving away from the
    batch Sprint model, to a continuous flow model by using Kanban Boards and Cards.
    However, we can also streamline and accelerate our value delivery processes through
    integration and automation strategies. **Continuous integration** (**CI**), **continuous
    delivery** (**CD**), DevOps, platforms, and software factories help us achieve
    these goals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, CI and CD capabilities help the IT development teams streamline, integrate,
    and automate their **software development life cycle** (**SDLC**) processes. That's
    not to say that the entire set of SDLC processes should be streamlined, integrated,
    and automated all at once. Rapid adoption may not be possible for a small IT shop
    or a small team within a larger organization that has not implemented DevOps platforms
    or software factories. But the eventual end-to-end streamlining, integration,
    and automation of the software development value stream is the ideal goal from
    a Lean perspective.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With CI/CD capabilities, DevOps takes the Lean concepts as integrated value
    streams into the IT operation's functionality. Specifically, the IT organization
    can implement value stream management capabilities to integrate front and backend
    processes. Again, attempting to manage all these changes at once is not practical
    for most organizations. However, the ideal objective is to reach such a stage
    of integrated capabilities as quickly as possible.
