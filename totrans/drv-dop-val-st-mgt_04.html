			<p>IT organizations represent complex systems on several levels. First, the process of software development is a system, as are the operations and support functions. Second, the inclusion of team members extends the software development system's complexity, as does their computing equipment, networks, tools, and software applications.</p>
			<p>Suppose the IT department supports multiple Agile or DevOps development teams working on a single product. In that case, each product team would function as both an independent system and as a component of a more extensive system – a "team of teams." In these scenarios, all the teams must collaborate to support the ongoing development of the software product or digitally-enabled service. This chapter provides guidance on assessing the complexity of these (and any other types of systems) by evaluating the elements that make up the system, their connections, and types of interactions.</p>
			<p>An essential analytical tool of value stream management is a modeling and visualization technique referred to as value stream mapping. This technique is introduced in the next chapter as part of the introduction to value stream management. However, if a value stream team only examines their activities, they may miss the broader scope of elements that impact their value stream as a system. They may also miss how those elements impact their system. This type of cross-domain complexity analysis is the domain of <strong class="bold">systems thinking</strong>, which is the topic of this chapter.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Resolving IT complexity through systems thinking</li>
				<li>Analyzing cause and effects</li>
				<li>Calculating potential connections</li>
				<li>Limiting connections</li>
				<li>Learning the vocabulary of systems thinking</li>
				<li>Visualizing the interrelationships of system elements</li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>Resolving IT complexity through systems thinking</h1>
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>Systems thinking is an approach to <a id="_idIndexMarker290"/>evaluate the <a id="_idIndexMarker291"/>complexity of large systems not as a collection of individuals parts but rather the interactions between the elements that participate in the system. I discuss this subject at great length in <a href="B17087_04_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor104"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Systems Thinking</em>, of the book <em class="italic">Scaling Scrum Across Modern Enterprises</em>, introducing 17 CLDs related to Scrum-based Agile practices. So we'll only touch briefly on the subject of systems thinking within this book. </p>
			<p>Systems thinking also aids in analyzing other complex business processes, including the interactions of connected value streams. However, in this book, the primary focus is on using value stream mapping to evaluate and improve business processes. Still, systems thinking is a precursory activity to value stream mapping. As a result, Lean-Agile practitioners must understand the vernacular of systems thinking, analyze system-level cause and effects, evaluate approaches to reduce network densities, and use system visualization techniques.</p>
			<p>Though both systems thinking and value stream mapping employ visualization and modeling techniques to evaluate flows, they have different objectives. Systems thinking aims to identify all the elements that intentionally and unintentionally participate in the system, determine which elements interact within the system, how the elements interact, and their cause and effects. In contrast, value stream mapping is a technique to assess the current and future state of how work is done, then find ways to improve it.</p>
			<p>The impacts, causes, and effects of interacting elements are the most critical issues to address when evaluating complex systems' aggregate behaviors. Let's take a moment to find out why.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>Analyzing cause and effects in systems</h1>
			<p>A key concept in <a id="_idIndexMarker292"/>systems thinking is that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts that participate within a system. This statement is true for both system capabilities and complexities. It's the interrelationships between the parts that create complexity within a system. But the interrelationships also are what allow systems to do both useful and useless things. If we don't understand the cause and effects of the underlying interactions across the system, we can't begin to understand how to control the interactions in useful ways.</p>
			<p>Participant relationships and interactions can be accidental or intentional within the system. For example, we can evaluate a manufacturing ecosystem as representing a single system with any number of participating elements that interact, causing both desired (<em class="italic">intentional</em>) and undesired (<em class="italic">unintentional</em>) impacts. Some of the elements intentionally work to support the manufacturer's operations and delivery functions. However, the manufacturing system can also negatively impact other unintentional participants.</p>
			<p>Within the manufacturing ecosystem, intentional participants include supply chain partners, distributors, employees, contractors, customers, and other stakeholders supporting the operations. Unintentional participants include people and other elements affected when the industry creates health or safety problems through unsafe environmental practices.</p>
			<p>From a systems thinking point of view, we need to understand how organizations conduct their business at a more granular level. We also need to understand the interactions of the participating elements. An <strong class="bold">element</strong> is anything <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>that makes up the system, including materials, people, processes, information, and technology. Elements within a system are also <a id="_idIndexMarker294"/>sometimes called <strong class="bold">nodes</strong>. In <strong class="bold">CLD modeling</strong>, we use nodes and arrows to construct directed graphic models of cause and effect relationships.</p>
			<p>Technically, a directed graphical model includes the probability of random variables affecting the nodes in the graph. In other words, the cause and effects can vary across a range of values for each system interaction. However, we don't need to get into that level of detail in this chapter.</p>
			<p>The challenge with understanding the interrelationships between elements within a system is that we may not know those relationships exist, nor how those interactions play out across the system, without detailed system-level analysis. We'll review how to visualize elements and their interactions via CLD modeling later in the <em class="italic">Visualizing the interrelationships of system elements</em> subsection. However, before we do that, let's take a quick look to see how the number of elements within a system dramatically impacts the number of interrelationships. Plus, we need to learn some of the terms used in systems <a id="_idIndexMarker295"/>thinking before getting to the <em class="italic">Reading a CLD</em> section. In the next section, you will learn how to calculate potential connections to demonstrate the exponential increase in a system's complexity through a geometric growth in participating elements.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>Calculating potential connections</h1>
			<p>Systems represent interconnected networks. For example, the IT organization within a large enterprise <a id="_idIndexMarker296"/>might have several hundred or even several <a id="_idIndexMarker297"/>thousand employees and contractors working across its development and operations functions. Additionally, those employees and contractors work with and affect other departments, partners, employees, stakeholders, and customers. The IT system also includes computers, networks, applications, and a host of other elements that participate in the IT ecosystem.</p>
			<p>The organization creates policies and processes to help coordinate business functions and people's activities in order to achieve desirable outcomes by producing value-added products and services at a profit or within budget. Every one of these process touchpoints represents an interaction within the more extensive business system. Of course, there is the possibility for any number of unintentional, unplanned, and potentially undesirable interactions.</p>
			<p>By now, you may be getting a sense that the growth in connections in large systems might be a big problem. However, unless you are already familiar with the concept of managing network densities, you may not realize just how fast these interconnections and potential relationships grow.</p>
			<p>Fortunately for us, there is a reasonably easy way to calculate the number of <em class="italic">potential connections</em> (<em class="italic">PC</em> in the following formulae) between elements that interact within a system. We can also calculate network densities as a percentage of actual connections to potential connections. Let's start with the potential connections algorithm; the highest possible measurement of interactions across a system.</p>
			<p>The calculation for potential connections is<img src="image/B17087_03_001.png" alt=""/>, where <em class="italic">n</em> is the number of nodes or element connections within the system. In any system, the participating elements are the nodes that create complexity through their interactions. The more nodes, the greater the complexity. Let's look at some examples:</p>
			<p>If n=1, then the number of potential connections is 0, as there is nothing else to connect. Add another node, and the number of potential connections only grows by one, that is, <img src="image/B17087_03_002.png" alt=""/>. Add yet another node, 3 in total, and the number of connections grows to 3.</p>
			<p>So far, the number of <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>relationships and interactions looks very manageable. But now, let's grow the number of connections to 7, the <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>size of a decent-sized Agile team. In this scenario, the number of potential connections is 21. As the team size grows, or we add more teams working together, the number of potential connections explodes.</p>
			<p>Now, let's add the team member's laptops to our Agile team example. By adding laptops into our systems, we create equipment-related interrelationships in our IT team. The laptops grow the number of nodes in our Agile system to 14, and the potential connections to 91. In other words, the team and their laptops form 91 interactions that can impact how the team interoperates.</p>
			<p>But the Agile team also works on delivering a Sprint Backlog item over each Sprint. For this example, let's use an average of 10 work items per Sprint. So, the number of connected nodes now increases to include 7 team members, 7 laptops, 10 work items – 24 elements in total, and the number of potential connections exponentially jumps to 276 potential connections in every Sprint. </p>
			<p>Do you work in a multi-team environment? To demonstrate how that further adds to the complexity of managing an Agile team, let's add a second team of equal size to our IT product development system. As a result, the number of connected nodes now increases to include 14 team members, 14 laptops, and 20 work items, expanding our Agile system to 48 elements. As a result, the number of potential connections grows to 1,128.</p>
			<p>We could include customers and other employees they must interact with, but I think you get the point. Every one of those potential connections is a potential point of failure or has the potential to create an undesirable outcome across every Sprint. The growth in system connections is shown in the following figure:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer025" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_3.1.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1 – Growth in potential system connections&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.1 – Growth in potential system connections</p>
			<p>As an example of <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>how potential connections <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/>exponentially grow within a system, <em class="italic">Figure 3.1 </em>provides a graphical depiction of accelerated PC growth from 0 out to 100 interconnected elements as an example of how potential connections exponentially grow within a system. A 10-person team has 45 potential connections, but an IT organization with 100 members has 4,950.</p>
			<p>Before we leave this topic, it's important to understand that we can eliminate some potentially negative consequences by limiting the number of actual connections. That's the subject of the next section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>Limiting connections</h1>
			<p>Often, not all <a id="_idIndexMarker302"/>elements in a system are connected. The <a id="_idIndexMarker303"/>easiest way to reduce system complexity is to reduce the opportunity for elements to communicate or interoperate with one another. Another way is to reduce the number of elements that participate in a system.</p>
			<p>If you have studied Scrum or Lean-Agile scaling strategies, you probably noted that they all leverage small team concepts. They do this even on very large product development activities, sometimes involving hundreds or thousands of people. Breaking up work across multiple small teams is one way to limit the number of interactions between the people working on the product.</p>
			<p>For example, <strong class="bold">Scrum of Scrums</strong> limits cross-team <a id="_idIndexMarker304"/>interactions to a handful of team members, called Ambassadors. The <strong class="bold">Nexus</strong> approach <a id="_idIndexMarker305"/>to Scrum implements <strong class="bold">Network Integration Teams</strong> (<strong class="bold">NITs</strong>) to <a id="_idIndexMarker306"/>manage cross-team dependencies, coordination, and synchronization activities. Similarly, the <strong class="bold">Scaled-Agile Framework®</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAFe®</strong>) implements <a id="_idIndexMarker307"/>small teams in the form of <strong class="bold">Extreme Programming</strong> (<strong class="bold">XP</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Scrum</strong> teams, with a higher-level team, called the <strong class="bold">Agile Release Train</strong> (<strong class="bold">ARTs</strong>), to <a id="_idIndexMarker308"/>integrate and coordinate <a id="_idIndexMarker309"/>work across a large product development effort, or multiple value <a id="_idIndexMarker310"/>streams involving 50-125 people split into 5-12 XP/Scrum teams.</p>
			<p>Regardless of their specific strategies, all scaled Scrum and Lean-Agile methodologies seek to minimize complexity by reducing the number of participant relationships and interactions. In other words, we want fewer actual connections in our system than the potential theoretical connections.</p>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker311"/>ratio of actual connections to potential connections is called <strong class="bold">network density</strong>. The <a id="_idIndexMarker312"/>concept of <a id="_idIndexMarker313"/>network density is important as it offers a way to minimize the number of potential connections in large systems and reduce their potential for causing adverse impacts.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Figure 3.2</em> shows a set of six Lean value stream activities operating as sequential nodes connected along a single line. The graphic also shows the worst-case scenarios for each identified value stream, where all activities are interconnected. Each value stream includes metrics identifying the number of nodes (<em class="italic">n</em>), their potential connections (<em class="italic">PC</em>), actual connections (<em class="italic">AC</em>), and their network densities (<em class="italic">ND</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer026" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_3.2.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 – Graphic showing nodes, potential connections, actual connections, and network densities&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.2 – Graphic showing nodes, potential connections, actual connections, and network densities</p>
			<p>It should be clear <a id="_idIndexMarker314"/>from the graphic that the least <a id="_idIndexMarker315"/>number of interactions, and therefore the least complexities, occur in situations with value streams having linear-sequential processes or activities. In this book, you will learn that linear-sequential flows are the hallmark of lean production practices and CI/CD and DevOps pipelines. When we reduce network density by lowering actual connections, we lower the number of potential failure points.</p>
			<p>Drawing on our previous example, ways to decrease the network density include having backup laptops and access to alternative software products. Another way to improve outcomes in a complex system is to improve policies and processes that reduce the impact of or repair failed connections. For example, an IT support group that can rapidly reprovision laptops and software can reduce the downtime from losing access to those resources.</p>
			<p>We can also reduce the number of interconnections between team members and the work items. For example, if our team members have broad skills, they can split the work items to reduce the number of dependencies across the work items. We can also limit the number of inter- and extra-team member interactions. This issue is critical within cross-team interactions. It's the reason so many scaled Scrum methodologies implement <strong class="bold">ambassadors</strong> or <strong class="bold">network integration teams</strong> to minimize cross-team interactions.</p>
			<p>In a lean system, the <a id="_idIndexMarker316"/>ideal goal is to create a streamlined set of <a id="_idIndexMarker317"/>activities across a value stream, much like an assembly line, enabling work to flow through a set of independent activities in one direction and without the need to recycle back to a previous activity. It should be clear from the examples shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.2</em> that the linear-sequential flows are much less complicated and more streamlined. It should also be clear that network density issues become increasingly necessary to resolve with the increasing growth of activities (nodes) in a value stream system.</p>
			<p>So far, our sample system interactions are quite simple. Life is much more complicated in that each system interaction can have different types of impacts. Complex system interactions between elements are <a id="_idIndexMarker318"/>modeled and analyzed as <strong class="bold">causal links</strong>. But, before we get to that topic, let's take a moment to introduce the vocabulary of systems thinking.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>Learning the vocabulary of systems thinking</h1>
			<p>The vocabulary of <a id="_idIndexMarker319"/>systems thinking is unique and not directly tied to Agile or Lean practices. But the concepts behind systems thinking are powerful and useful in helping teams collaborate in analyzing the elements and interrelationships within their large and complex business systems. The following list includes the basic terms of use in systems thinking and causal loop diagrams:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Systems</strong>: These are <a id="_idIndexMarker320"/>complex structures of tangible and intangible things, principles, procedures, and social and political environments that collectively serve some purpose or function.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Elements</strong>: This term <a id="_idIndexMarker321"/>refers to the collection of parts that make up a system. These could be tangible and intangible things, principles, procedures, or social and political environments that participate in and guide the system's behaviors.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Interconnections</strong>: The relationships—including physical, informational, formal, or informal linkages—that <a id="_idIndexMarker322"/>bind elements together within the system.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Function</strong>: The purpose, goal, or objective of a <a id="_idIndexMarker323"/>non-human system.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Purpose</strong>: The purpose, goal, or objective of a <a id="_idIndexMarker324"/>human-based system.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stocks</strong>: These <a id="_idIndexMarker325"/>are tangible, quantifiable, and measurable variables within a system, subject to dynamic changes over time through a flow's actions. The term <em class="italic">element</em> implies a type of thing at any given time; the term <em class="italic">stock</em> implies attributes of the elements with observable values at specific points in time. For example, an element might be a value stream activity, and its stock might be work items or materials.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Flows</strong>: These actions <a id="_idIndexMarker326"/>dynamically change the directions of stock within a system, as inflows and outflows.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inflows</strong>: These indicate a <a id="_idIndexMarker327"/>direction of flow that serves to increase the measurable amount of stock. Inflow displays have lines with arrows that point to the elements accumulating stock.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Outflows</strong>: These indicate a <a id="_idIndexMarker328"/>direction of flow that serves to decrease the measurable amount of stock. Outflow displays have lines with arrows that point away from the elements with decrementing stocks.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Delays</strong>: These occur <a id="_idIndexMarker329"/>when inflows are greater than outflows, resulting in an accumulation of stock. Displays of delays are indicated by writing the word <em class="italic">delay</em> on the arrow connecting elements, or a double hash mark striking through the connecting arrow.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Feedback loops</strong>: These are <a id="_idIndexMarker330"/>mechanisms that adjust flows to either stabilize a system or reinforce a particular trend within the system.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Balancing feedback loops</strong>: These <a id="_idIndexMarker331"/>provide information or resources that bring a system or elements into equilibrium and maintain them within the desired range.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reinforcing feedback loops</strong>: These <a id="_idIndexMarker332"/>provide information or resources that support a trend within a system, or support elements within a system. The trend can be either positive or negative.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Causal Loop Diagram (CLD)</strong>: A method <a id="_idIndexMarker333"/>to visualize the interrelationships of elements (a.k.a. <em class="italic">variables</em>) within a system as nodes and linkages between nodes (a.k.a. <em class="italic">edges</em>).</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Positive causal link</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker334"/>means that the cause-and-effect impact of two linked nodes changes the observed attributes in the same (positive) direction, increasing the value of the monitored attributes.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Negative causal link</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker335"/>means that the cause-and-effect impact of two linked nodes changes the observed attributes in the opposite (negative) direction.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Open systems</strong>: These are <a id="_idIndexMarker336"/>characterized by having inflows and outflows external to the system—that is, things that can enter or leave the system.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Closed systems</strong>: These are <a id="_idIndexMarker337"/>characterized by having no net flows in or out of the system—that is, the system is fully self-contained and balanced.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Labels</strong>: Use labels on <a id="_idIndexMarker338"/>everything displayed within your causal diagrams so that reviewers know what the elements and links represent within your system model.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that you know the basic terms of systems thinking and causal loop diagraming, let's take a quick look at using them when analyzing an Agile-based development team as a system.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor092"/>Visualizing the interrelationships of system elements</h1>
			<p>This section uses an <a id="_idIndexMarker339"/>example CLD from the previous book – <em class="italic">Scaling Scrum Across Modern Enterprises</em> – that describes a Scrum-based Sprint planning process (see <em class="italic">Figure 3.3</em>). This exercise aims not to explain the Sprint planning process but rather to show how the CLD modeling process works, using an Agile point of reference. Again, for those of you who want a more detailed understanding of using systems thinking and CLD techniques to evaluate the Lean-Agile process, I refer you to Scaled Scrum Across Modern Enterprises. </p>
			<p>A Sprint Planning example is shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer027" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_3.3.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3 – Sprint Planning CLD&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.3 – Sprint Planning CLD</p>
			<p>It's important to n<a id="_idTextAnchor093"/>ote that CLD arrows always close system cycles to show a reinforcing or balancing feedback loop. In other words, all CLD nodes connect back to the entry point to form a loop, no matter how large or complex the system, creating a reinforcing or balancing effect.</p>
			<p>A reinforcing loop is a <a id="_idIndexMarker340"/>cycle in which changing a variable propagates through the system to increase or decrease a trend. In contrast, a balancing loop is a cycle in which the effect of changing a variable propagates through the loop and forces a response to counter the new trend. Our example of a CLD for the Scrum-based Sprint Planning process is a form of reinforcing loop, as work items entered into the Sprint Backlog decrements the number of work items in the Product Backlog.</p>
			<p>In a CDL, we use lines to represent flows, and the arrows indicate the impact of these flows. For example, a positive arrow (+) indicates a <em class="italic">positive causal link</em> relationship that trends in the same direction, while negative arrows (-) indicate a <em class="italic">negative causal link</em>, or opposing trend.</p>
			<p>In this model, the customer and end user requirements flow from a Sprint Review (a demo of the previous increments) or directly from external sources. The relationship is a positive causal link, as the trend is in the same direction. In other words, as customers and end users develop new requirements, they increase the flow of prospective work items.</p>
			<p>In contrast, note the link between the number of items in the product backlog and the number of refined items in the product backlog, a negative causal link. This relationship suggests that the refinement process has a general trend to reduce the number of work items that flow out of the backlog.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor094"/>Reading a CLD</h1>
			<p>Before we end this chapter, let's <a id="_idIndexMarker341"/>work our way around the Sprint Planning Process (displayed in <em class="italic">Figure 2.10</em> in the previous chapter). This exercise will help you understand how to assess the relationships described across the CLD model.</p>
			<p>Sprint planning is <a id="_idIndexMarker342"/>part of Scrum-based Agile methodology. I previously noted that there are 17 CLD models in my previous book. However, the 17 CLD models span 3 distinct processes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sprint Planning</li>
				<li>Project-to-product team transformations</li>
				<li>Enterprise implementations of Scrum</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All three CLD models <a id="_idIndexMarker343"/>are related to analyzing IT functions, but each has a very different scope and set of objectives. For example, the Sprint Planning model is composed of five separate CLDs. The five CLDs break out loosely around specific areas of focus that the teams might want to analyze. These areas include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A CLD model of analyzing Product Backlog priorities</li>
				<li>An open CLD model of Product Backlog refinement activities</li>
				<li>A CLD model of design and work clarifications</li>
				<li>A CLD model of analyzing work against team capacity</li>
				<li>A CLD model of negotiations and trade-off activities</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There is only one resulting Sprint Planning CLD model, but the team may prefer to break the work out along the lines of concern and build the Sprint planning CLD model incrementally. Let's now look at each of these sub-CLD models briefly.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-79">CLD model of analyzing Product Backlo<a id="_idTextAnchor095"/>g priorities</h2>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker344"/>goal of this CLD (see <em class="italic">Figure 3.4</em>) is to understand the <a id="_idIndexMarker345"/>elements involved in building a backlog of customer and end-user requirements. The model is shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer028" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_3.4.jpg" alt="Figure 3.4 – CLD model of analyzing Product Backlog priorities&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.4 – CLD model of analyzing Product Backlog priorities</p>
			<p>Customer and end-user requirements flow into or through the Sprint Review process and external processes beyond the scope of this Sprint Planning CLD model. The arrows <em class="italic">with</em> the positive (+) signs indicate a positive causal link, which indicates that the trend or impact moves in the same direction. In other words, the addition of requirements adds to the stock of items in the product backlog.</p>
			<p>But note that this positive causal link does not mean the flow is only an additive process. The (+) and (–) signs on the arrows do not imply a mathematical addition or subtraction process, only whether the flow is reinforcing a trend, or not. As a result, the positive (+) flow as a relationship between elements also means a reduction in requirements. This leads to a reduction of the stock of items in the Product Backlog.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor096"/>Open CLD model of Product Backlog refinement activities</h2>
			<p>The goal <a id="_idIndexMarker346"/>of this CLD (see <em class="italic">Figure 3.5</em>) is to understand the elements involved in refining the work items listed in the product backlog. To clarify, this means decomposing epics into user stories and understanding the development tasks. We can see this in the following figure:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer029" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_3.5.jpg" alt="Figure 3.5 – Open CLD model of Product Backlog refinement activities&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.5 – Open CLD model of Product Backlog refinement activities</p>
			<p>The example shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.5</em> includes arrows with negative (-) trends, which means the relationships between elements are negative causal links between the number of items in the <a id="_idIndexMarker347"/>backlog and the number of refined <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>product backlog items. There is a similar negative causal link between the number of refined product backlog items in the product backlog and the prioritized items in the product backlog.</p>
			<p>It may be a bit difficult at first glance to understand what's going on, particularly for those who don't understand the details. The negative causal links indicate that as the node in which a link starts increases, the other node decreases, and vice versa. In other words, both the refinement and prioritization activities have an opposing effect on the stock of work items. This oppositional effect happens because there are limits on how much work the teams can take to refine and prioritize.</p>
			<p>Suppose, for example, a customer wants a new feature included in the next release. The item is included in the product backlog as an epic or user story. The item must be refined to ensure the team fully understands the requirements, and whether they are a priority. The negative links indicate the number of refined item trends in the opposite direction from the number of initial items that go into the backlog. </p>
			<p>The same trend occurs as the product owner decides which of the refined work items have a high priority. However, those items that have a high priority inform the Sprint Goal in the same direction. So, in other words, an increase in the number of high-priority work items increases the scope of the Sprint Goal. Likewise, if stocks of refined and prioritized work items dwindle, the scope of the Sprint Goal <a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>becomes smaller.</p>

			<p>The goal of the <a id="_idIndexMarker349"/>next CLD (see <em class="italic">Figure 3.6</em>) is to understand <a id="_idIndexMarker350"/>the elements involved in the CLD model of design and work clarifications. This CLD is a visualization of the work item design and scoping activities. Note that all relationships between elements have positive causal linkages:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.6 – CLD model of design and work clarifications</p>
			<p>In this CLD, the team requires clarifications from the product owner and other sources, such as customers and end users, on the details of the requirements. Improved clarifying details improve the design and ability to scope the effort, and vice versa.</p>
			<p>Note that we also have a positive causal linkage from another part of the model that describes the Sprint Goal in terms of priorities in the product backlog. Understanding the Sprint Goal leads to a better understanding of the design requirements and scope of the effort.</p>
			<p>Finally, there is a positive causal link between the <em class="italic">Define Design requirements</em> element and the <em class="italic">Scope the work effort</em> element. As the team better understands the design, they can better understand the work scope in the upcoming Sprint.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor099"/>CLD model of analyzing work against team capacity</h2>
			<p>This CLD (<em class="italic">see Figure 3.7</em>) aims to understand the elements involved in the  CLD model of analyzing work against team capacity. Though this is a larger and more complex CLD, the concepts remain the same, and we just have to work our way through the linkages:</p>

			<p>Without seeing this part of the CLD in context with the entire Sprint Planning CLD, it isn't easy to see where we should start. However, we should start with the element titled <em class="italic">Defined Sprint Goal in context with product backlog priorities</em>. In the next subsection, we'll see how the interactions in this CLD exit to another CLD via the <em class="italic"># of items in the Sprint Backlog node</em>. Also, note that this CLD includes several smaller CLD loops. The activities are linked through their participation in evaluating team capacity against the desired product backlog priorities. </p>
			<p>The importance of this CLD is that it defines the elements and interactions necessary to define the initial tasks in the context of team capacities and their ability to self-organize around the work planned for the Sprint. Ultimately, these relationships lead to decisions on the number (and type) of work items added into the Sprint backlog. Note that the items also reinforce the design criteria for the product's development within the Sprint.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>CLD model of negotiations and trade-off activities</h2>
			<p>The goal of <a id="_idIndexMarker351"/>this CLD (see <em class="italic">Figure 3.8</em>) is to understand the <a id="_idIndexMarker352"/>CLD model of negotiations and trade-off activities. The elements and interactions in the previous CLD – analyzing work against team capacity – impacted design-related decisions. But note that the team has added a CLD loop to analyze design-related impacts against their capacity to determine whether trade-offs are required and need to be negotiated with the product owner. For example, there may be technical debt issues that need to be addressed before taking on some of the higher-priority work items:</p>

			<p>We've now completed our review of the entire Sprint Planning CLD and the topics for this chapter. The critical thing to know about CLD modeling is that there is no universal truth. What works in your value stream may not be appropriate or work in another organization's value streams, even when they have similar purposes.</p>
			<p>We'll dive into value stream management basics as a Lean-oriented modeling and visualization tool in the next chapter. But, before we do that, let's summarize what you learned in this chapter. Then, take the quick test to see if you have any areas you need to review.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor101"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you learned that systems are much more complicated than the sum of their parts. The number of potential connections and interactions explodes with a geometric increase as the number of participating elements increases. You've learned how to use systems thinking to analyze the complexities of the elements and their relationships. You've also learned the vocabulary of systems thinking and how to use CLD as a modeling and visualization technique to work through complex interrelationships. Next, you got to use your newfound knowledge in systems thinking and CLD visualizations to review the Sprint Planning process. Finally, you learned that systems thinking takes a different approach to modeling and visualizing flows than value stream mapping. </p>
			<p>With this knowledge, you now have the skills to assess the participating elements and their relationships within a system – relationships that contribute to complexities through their interactions. Systems thinking is an analytic approach to understanding the impacts, causes, and effects of interconnected and interacting elements. In contrast, value stream mapping is a technique to assess the current and future state of how work is done, then find ways to improve it.</p>
			<p>Where systems thinking gives us the tools to discover and assess the impacts of interrelating elements, value stream mapping gives us the tools to improve work and information flows. We'll explore the components of value stream management in the next chapter.</p>
