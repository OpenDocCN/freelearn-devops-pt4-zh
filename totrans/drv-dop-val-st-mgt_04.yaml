    of software development is a system, as are the operations and support functions.
    Second, the inclusion of team members extends the software development system's
    complexity, as does their computing equipment, networks, tools, and software applications.

    working on a single product. In that case, each product team would function as
    both an independent system and as a component of a more extensive system – a "team
    of teams." In these scenarios, all the teams must collaborate to support the ongoing
    development of the software product or digitally-enabled service. This chapter
    provides guidance on assessing the complexity of these (and any other types of
    systems) by evaluating the elements that make up the system, their connections,
    and types of interactions.

    technique referred to as value stream mapping. This technique is introduced in
    the next chapter as part of the introduction to value stream management. However,
    if a value stream team only examines their activities, they may miss the broader
    scope of elements that impact their value stream as a system. They may also miss
    how those elements impact their system. This type of cross-domain complexity analysis
    is the domain of **systems thinking**, which is the topic of this chapter.

- en: Systems thinking is an approach to evaluate the complexity of large systems
    not as a collection of individuals parts but rather the interactions between the
    elements that participate in the system. I discuss this subject at great length
    in [*Chapter 4*](B17087_04_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor104), *Systems Thinking*,
    of the book *Scaling Scrum Across Modern Enterprises*, introducing 17 CLDs related
    to Scrum-based Agile practices. So we'll only touch briefly on the subject of
    systems thinking within this book.
  prefs: []

- en: Systems thinking also aids in analyzing other complex business processes, including
    the interactions of connected value streams. However, in this book, the primary
    focus is on using value stream mapping to evaluate and improve business processes.
    Still, systems thinking is a precursory activity to value stream mapping. As a
    result, Lean-Agile practitioners must understand the vernacular of systems thinking,
    analyze system-level cause and effects, evaluate approaches to reduce network
    densities, and use system visualization techniques.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Though both systems thinking and value stream mapping employ visualization and
    modeling techniques to evaluate flows, they have different objectives. Systems
    thinking aims to identify all the elements that intentionally and unintentionally
    participate in the system, determine which elements interact within the system,
    how the elements interact, and their cause and effects. In contrast, value stream
    mapping is a technique to assess the current and future state of how work is done,
    then find ways to improve it.
  prefs: []

    issues to address when evaluating complex systems' aggregate behaviors. Let's
    take a moment to find out why.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A key concept in systems thinking is that the whole is greater than the sum
    of the parts that participate within a system. This statement is true for both
    system capabilities and complexities. It's the interrelationships between the
    parts that create complexity within a system. But the interrelationships also
    are what allow systems to do both useful and useless things. If we don't understand
    the cause and effects of the underlying interactions across the system, we can't
    begin to understand how to control the interactions in useful ways.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Participant relationships and interactions can be accidental or intentional
    within the system. For example, we can evaluate a manufacturing ecosystem as representing
    a single system with any number of participating elements that interact, causing
    both desired (*intentional*) and undesired (*unintentional*) impacts. Some of
    the elements intentionally work to support the manufacturer's operations and delivery
    functions. However, the manufacturing system can also negatively impact other
    unintentional participants.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Within the manufacturing ecosystem, intentional participants include supply
    chain partners, distributors, employees, contractors, customers, and other stakeholders
    supporting the operations. Unintentional participants include people and other
    elements affected when the industry creates health or safety problems through
    unsafe environmental practices.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From a systems thinking point of view, we need to understand how organizations
    conduct their business at a more granular level. We also need to understand the
    interactions of the participating elements. An **element** is anything that makes
    up the system, including materials, people, processes, information, and technology.
    Elements within a system are also sometimes called **nodes**. In **CLD modeling**,
    we use nodes and arrows to construct directed graphic models of cause and effect
    relationships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Technically, a directed graphical model includes the probability of random variables
    affecting the nodes in the graph. In other words, the cause and effects can vary
    across a range of values for each system interaction. However, we don't need to
    get into that level of detail in this chapter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The challenge with understanding the interrelationships between elements within
    a system is that we may not know those relationships exist, nor how those interactions
    play out across the system, without detailed system-level analysis. We'll review
    how to visualize elements and their interactions via CLD modeling later in the
    *Visualizing the interrelationships of system elements* subsection. However, before
    we do that, let's take a quick look to see how the number of elements within a
    system dramatically impacts the number of interrelationships. Plus, we need to
    learn some of the terms used in systems thinking before getting to the *Reading
    a CLD* section. In the next section, you will learn how to calculate potential
    connections to demonstrate the exponential increase in a system's complexity through
    a geometric growth in participating elements.

    within a large enterprise might have several hundred or even several thousand
    employees and contractors working across its development and operations functions.
    Additionally, those employees and contractors work with and affect other departments,
    partners, employees, stakeholders, and customers. The IT system also includes
    computers, networks, applications, and a host of other elements that participate
    in the IT ecosystem.

    system. Of course, there is the possibility for any number of unintentional, unplanned,

    might be a big problem. However, unless you are already familiar with the concept
    of managing network densities, you may not realize just how fast these interconnections
    and potential relationships grow.
  prefs: []

    *potential connections* (*PC* in the following formulae) between elements that
    interact within a system. We can also calculate network densities as a percentage
    of actual connections to potential connections. Let's start with the potential
    connections algorithm; the highest possible measurement of interactions across
    a system.

    interactions. The more nodes, the greater the complexity. Let''s look at some
    examples:'

    But now, let's grow the number of connections to 7, the size of a decent-sized
    Agile team. In this scenario, the number of potential connections is 21\. As the
    team size grows, or we add more teams working together, the number of potential
    connections explodes.

    laptops into our systems, we create equipment-related interrelationships in our

    potential connections to 91\. In other words, the team and their laptops form
    91 interactions that can impact how the team interoperates.

    Sprint. For this example, let's use an average of 10 work items per Sprint. So,
    the number of connected nodes now increases to include 7 team members, 7 laptops,
    10 work items – 24 elements in total, and the number of potential connections
    exponentially jumps to 276 potential connections in every Sprint.

    that they all leverage small team concepts. They do this even on very large product
    development activities, sometimes involving hundreds or thousands of people. Breaking
    up work across multiple small teams is one way to limit the number of interactions
    between the people working on the product.

    of team members, called Ambassadors. The **Nexus** approach to Scrum implements
    **Network Integration Teams** (**NITs**) to manage cross-team dependencies, coordination,
    and synchronization activities. Similarly, the **Scaled-Agile Framework®** (**SAFe®**)
    implements small teams in the form of **Extreme Programming** (**XP**) and **Scrum**
    teams, with a higher-level team, called the **Agile Release Train** (**ARTs**),

    therefore the least complexities, occur in situations with value streams having
    linear-sequential processes or activities. In this book, you will learn that linear-sequential
    flows are the hallmark of lean production practices and CI/CD and DevOps pipelines.
    When we reduce network density by lowering actual connections, we lower the number
    of potential failure points.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    having backup laptops and access to alternative software products. Another way
    to improve outcomes in a complex system is to improve policies and processes that
    reduce the impact of or repair failed connections. For example, an IT support
    group that can rapidly reprovision laptops and software can reduce the downtime
    from losing access to those resources.

    work items. For example, if our team members have broad skills, they can split
    the work items to reduce the number of dependencies across the work items. We
    can also limit the number of inter- and extra-team member interactions. This issue
    is critical within cross-team interactions. It's the reason so many scaled Scrum
    methodologies implement **ambassadors** or **network integration teams** to minimize
    cross-team interactions.

    across a value stream, much like an assembly line, enabling work to flow through
    a set of independent activities in one direction and without the need to recycle
    back to a previous activity. It should be clear from the examples shown in *Figure
    3.2* that the linear-sequential flows are much less complicated and more streamlined.
    It should also be clear that network density issues become increasingly necessary
    to resolve with the increasing growth of activities (nodes) in a value stream

    creating a reinforcing or balancing effect.

    the system to increase or decrease a trend. In contrast, a balancing loop is a
    cycle in which the effect of changing a variable propagates through the loop and
    forces a response to counter the new trend. Our example of a CLD for the Scrum-based
    Sprint Planning process is a form of reinforcing loop, as work items entered into
    the Sprint Backlog decrements the number of work items in the Product Backlog.

    and external processes beyond the scope of this Sprint Planning CLD model. The
    arrows *with* the positive (+) signs indicate a positive causal link, which indicates
    that the trend or impact moves in the same direction. In other words, the addition
    of requirements adds to the stock of items in the product backlog.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But note that this positive causal link does not mean the flow is only an additive
    process. The (+) and (–) signs on the arrows do not imply a mathematical addition
    or subtraction process, only whether the flow is reinforcing a trend, or not.
    As a result, the positive (+) flow as a relationship between elements also means
    a reduction in requirements. This leads to a reduction of the stock of items in
    the Product Backlog.

    which means the relationships between elements are negative causal links between
    the number of items in the backlog and the number of refined product backlog items.
    There is a similar negative causal link between the number of refined product
    backlog items in the product backlog and the prioritized items in the product
    backlog.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It may be a bit difficult at first glance to understand what's going on, particularly
    for those who don't understand the details. The negative causal links indicate
    that as the node in which a link starts increases, the other node decreases, and
    vice versa. In other words, both the refinement and prioritization activities
    have an opposing effect on the stock of work items. This oppositional effect happens
    because there are limits on how much work the teams can take to refine and prioritize.
  prefs: []

- en: Suppose, for example, a customer wants a new feature included in the next release.
    The item is included in the product backlog as an epic or user story. The item
    must be refined to ensure the team fully understands the requirements, and whether
    they are a priority. The negative links indicate the number of refined item trends
    in the opposite direction from the number of initial items that go into the backlog.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The same trend occurs as the product owner decides which of the refined work
    items have a high priority. However, those items that have a high priority inform
    the Sprint Goal in the same direction. So, in other words, an increase in the
    number of high-priority work items increases the scope of the Sprint Goal. Likewise,
    if stocks of refined and prioritized work items dwindle, the scope of the Sprint
    Goal becomes smaller.

    CLD, it isn't easy to see where we should start. However, we should start with
    the element titled *Defined Sprint Goal in context with product backlog priorities*.
    In the next subsection, we'll see how the interactions in this CLD exit to another
    CLD via the *# of items in the Sprint Backlog node*. Also, note that this CLD
    includes several smaller CLD loops. The activities are linked through their participation
    in evaluating team capacity against the desired product backlog priorities.

    necessary to define the initial tasks in the context of team capacities and their
    ability to self-organize around the work planned for the Sprint. Ultimately, these
    relationships lead to decisions on the number (and type) of work items added into
    the Sprint backlog. Note that the items also reinforce the design criteria for
    the product's development within the Sprint.

    for this chapter. The critical thing to know about CLD modeling is that there
    is no universal truth. What works in your value stream may not be appropriate
    or work in another organization's value streams, even when they have similar purposes.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, you learned that systems are much more complicated than the
    sum of their parts. The number of potential connections and interactions explodes
    with a geometric increase as the number of participating elements increases. You've
    learned how to use systems thinking to analyze the complexities of the elements
    and their relationships. You've also learned the vocabulary of systems thinking
    and how to use CLD as a modeling and visualization technique to work through complex
    interrelationships. Next, you got to use your newfound knowledge in systems thinking
    and CLD visualizations to review the Sprint Planning process. Finally, you learned
    that systems thinking takes a different approach to modeling and visualizing flows
    than value stream mapping.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this knowledge, you now have the skills to assess the participating elements
    and their relationships within a system – relationships that contribute to complexities
    through their interactions. Systems thinking is an analytic approach to understanding
    the impacts, causes, and effects of interconnected and interacting elements. In
    contrast, value stream mapping is a technique to assess the current and future
    state of how work is done, then find ways to improve it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Where systems thinking gives us the tools to discover and assess the impacts
    of interrelating elements, value stream mapping gives us the tools to improve
    work and information flows. We'll explore the components of value stream management
