			<p><strong class="bold">Value stream management</strong> (<strong class="bold">VSM</strong>) is fast becoming an essential capability in the <strong class="bold">Information Technology</strong> (<strong class="bold">IT</strong>) community, specifically as a means to assess and eliminate non-value-adding activities (waste) in your software delivery process. However, VSM is not a new concept. In this chapter, you will learn about the origins of VSM and its application to Lean-based production, supply chain, office, and IT-oriented processes.</p>
			<p>VSM provides an approach to evaluate all organizational development and operational value streams systematically and continuously. VSM practices and tools help improve all value streams, not just those in IT. A VSM initiative aims to ensure that our value streams are most efficient, align with corporate strategies, and add customer-centric value with minimal waste, but there is no reason to learn multiple VSM strategies.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will also learn the basic methods and tools of VSM. Specifically, you will learn about a generic eight-step VSM approach to plan, map, and sustain Lean improvements. Rather than learn an approach that's highly tailored to a specific set of VSM tools, this book aims to teach a proven approach, regardless of the value stream application or tools.</p>
			<p>The VSM eight-step approach is summarized in the following screenshot:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.1 – VSM eight-step approach</p>
			<p>The reason for taking this generic approach to VSM is that, in our digital economy, IT solutions often support other organizational value streams, becoming inseparably linked in the process. Therefore, understanding the fundamentals of VSM is critical, as every IT-based VSM initiative must support an organization's broader objectives to build and sustain a Lean enterprise across all value streams.</p>
			<p>Later, in <em class="italic">Part 2</em> of this book, we delve into actual case studies of IT-based VSM initiatives. Here, in this and the following two chapters, our focus is on learning the fundamental elements of VSM, regardless of the application.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I<a id="_idTextAnchor105"/>mplementing Lean concepts</li>
				<li>Identifying value streams</li>
				<li>Applying VSM methods and tools</li>

			<p>There are no specific requirements for this chapter.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor107"/>Implementing Lean concepts</h1>
			<p>VSM fundamentally involves implementing<a id="_idIndexMarker353"/> Lean concepts within an organization and making the Lean development and delivery processes a way of life. VSM is applied to streamline development and operations-oriented work to deliver customer-centric value more efficiently in modern Lean practices. In this context, IT-based development and operations activities are organizational value streams that similarly benefit from employing VSM capabilities. </p>
			<p>Specifically, VSM supports an IT department's efforts to become Lean through the implementation<a id="_idIndexMarker354"/> of <strong class="bold">continuous integration</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI</strong>) and <strong class="bold">continuous delivery</strong> (<strong class="bold">CD</strong>) capabilities, often<a id="_idIndexMarker355"/> as part of a larger <strong class="bold">DevOps</strong> process<a id="_idIndexMarker356"/> integration, automation, and collaboration strategy. Put another way, the use of VSM to drive DevOps development and delivery capabilities is essentially an organization's Lean value stream implementation strategy for IT value delivery.</p>
			<p>In their book <em class="italic">Value Stream Management: Eight Steps to Planning, Mapping, and Sustaining Lean Improvements</em>, the authors define VSM as follows:</p>
			<p>"<em class="italic">Value Stream Management is a process for planning and linking initiatives through simple data capture and analysis</em>." (Tapping, Luyster, Shuker, 2002, p.2)</p>
			<p>Note that their definition of VSM is not limited to making Lean production improvements across IT value streams. In fact, these authors collaborated on three books that apply a reusable VSM methodology<a id="_idIndexMarker357"/> to manufacturing, to Lean administrative offices, and across healthcare value streams, and it is their eight-step methodology that is applied in <em class="italic">Part 2</em> of this book, <em class="italic">Implementing Value Stream Management (VSM) Methods and Tools</em>, to analyze, plan, and execute Lean improvements in a CI/CD pipeline flow use-case scenario. We'll introduce the eight steps of VSM in a later section within this chapter, <em class="italic">Applying VSM methods and tools</em>. </p>
			<p>In our modern digital economy, IT supports virtually every organizational activity. Therefore, VSM practices cannot focus simply on improving IT value streams. Instead, IT-oriented VSM helps improve all value stream activities enterprise-wide. Moreover, since organizational value streams are often linked, we must improve customer delivery flows across all connected value streams. </p>
			<p>Let's look at a quick example. A customer is interested in purchasing a customizable product in our scenario, so they go online to a vendor's website to check out the available options. While on the site, they decide what they want to purchase and submit the order. The order triggers other value stream activities to place the order, make and receive payments, update accounting systems, order replacement materials, execute production, and eventually execute the organization's downstream fulfillment or provisioning and support processes. Along the way, IT systems are initiating the processes from start to finish while ensuring the correct information and materials show up at the right time and in the right place. Thus, all organizational value streams are linked to some degree, with the IT value stream serving as an essential enabler.</p>
			<p>In the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section of this book, you can see a listing of books devoted to applying VSM to Lean production processes in manufacturing, Lean offices, Lean supply chains, and Lean IT value streams. In a truly Lean enterprise, all organizational value streams need to be improved continuously and coordinated with other linked value streams. That is the premise of VSM. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor108"/>Implementing information flows</h2>
			<p>In a digital economy, every value stream<a id="_idIndexMarker358"/> has an information flow. In many cases, the digital value streams' materials are information elements (forms, graphics, <strong class="bold">business intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">BI</strong>), raw data, or information support services). In the previous paragraph, you learned that information flows<a id="_idIndexMarker359"/> are vital to support Lean production processes, but information flows are equally vital to support all frontend and backend value stream processes. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Frontend processes</strong> directly<a id="_idIndexMarker360"/> help the customer, while backend processes include all internal support activities that don't require face-to-face interactions. For example, frontend processes include sales support activities, either by people or via an online product information system. Likewise, an organization's customer support processes are examples of a frontend process. In contrast, examples of a <strong class="bold">backend process</strong> include<a id="_idIndexMarker361"/> supply and partner management practices and fulfillment. </p>
			<p>So, in other words, the terms <em class="italic">frontend</em> and <em class="italic">backend</em> have nothing to do with their order within a product's life cycle. Instead, think of the term <em class="italic">frontend</em> as implying those processes are conducted in front of a customer, while <em class="italic">backend</em> processes occur behind the scenes. </p>
			<p>However, in the lexicon of Lean terms, we use the terms <em class="italic">upstream</em> and <em class="italic">downstream</em> to indicate the relationships of activities in a product's life cycle, as illustrated in the following diagram. In Lean, the customer is always our focus, so the delivery of a product or service is the ultimate Lean process destination: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer035" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_4.2.jpg" alt="Figure 4.2 – Upstream versus downstream value stream activities&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.2 – Upstream versus downstream value stream activities</p>
			<p>In this co<a id="_idTextAnchor109"/>ntext, Lean value always flows downstream toward the customer, and any preceding activity is upstream. The same concept applies across each value stream. The activities furthest from the customer are always upstream from those performed closest to the customer.</p>
			<p>Expanding on the upstream<a id="_idIndexMarker362"/> and downstream example depicted in <em class="italic">Figure 4.2</em>, the flow of value includes a combination of materials and information<a id="_idIndexMarker363"/> that accumulates with each succeeding value stream activity until it's ready for delivery as a product or service to a customer.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-91"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>Defining types of value streams</h2>
			<p>The term <em class="italic">value stream</em> has expanded<a id="_idIndexMarker364"/> to include all value and non-value added activities within the business enterprise in a modern<a id="_idIndexMarker365"/> Lean context. Some value streams contribute directly to the development of products and services, while others focus on operations-oriented activities to deliver products and services. </p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Lean Enterprise Institute, Inc.</strong> (<strong class="bold">LEI</strong>) defines<a id="_idIndexMarker366"/> value<a id="_idIndexMarker367"/> streams in this <a id="_idIndexMarker368"/>manner:</p>
			<p><em class="italic">"All of the actions, both value-creating and non-value-creating, required to bring a product from concept to launch (also known as the development value stream) and from order to delivery (also known as the operational value stream). These include actions to process information from the customer and actions to transform the product on its way to the customer."</em></p>
			<p>– <em class="italic">From the Lean Lexicon, 5th edition</em></p>
			<p>Note that the value stream definition includes the actions necessary to process information from the customer. Also, recall that Toyota originally referred to value stream mapping as <em class="italic">materials and information flow mapping</em>. In Lean, we strive to improve the flow of materials and information to deliver customer-centric value efficiently. In this chapter, you will learn why an IT-based strategy to facilitate VSM plays a critical role in implementing and sustaining Lean initiatives across an enterprise. </p>
			<p>Modern VSM systems offer a set of methods and tools to map as-is and to-be activities, define the metrics for improvement, and monitor our progress against our performance objectives. In addition, analytical tools provide capabilities to evaluate cause and effect and simulate alternative business improvement strategies before making commitments and investments.</p>
			<p>We will come back to understand<a id="_idIndexMarker369"/> better how VSM helps<a id="_idIndexMarker370"/> identify and improve value streams later in this chapter. But before we do that, let's first take a moment to understand the original and still important concepts behind value streams and VSM.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-92"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>Employing VSM</h2>
			<p>VSM as a concept has been around<a id="_idIndexMarker371"/> for a while. Interestingly, James Martin, one of the IT leaders of the 1990s, applied the term <em class="italic">value stream</em> to software development<a id="_idIndexMarker372"/> practices in his book <em class="italic">The Great Transition: Using the Seven Disciplines of Enterprise Engineering to Align People, Technology, and Strategy</em> (Martin, 1995). Martin's book was published less than a year after James Womack and Daniel Jones initially coined the term in a <em class="italic">Harvard Business Review</em> article, <em class="italic">From Lean Production to the Lean Enterprise</em> (Womack and Jones, March-April 1994).</p>
			<p>On page 104, Martin defines the term <em class="italic">value stream</em> as "<em class="italic">an end-to-end collection of activities that result from a 'customer', who may be the ultimate customer or an internal 'end-user' of the value stream.</em>"</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The <strong class="bold">VSM</strong> acronym for <strong class="bold">value stream management</strong> is identical to that used for value stream mapping. This duplication of acronyms is an unfortunate coincidence, as value stream mapping is a subset of the overall VSM process. The <strong class="bold">VSM</strong> acronym, as used in this book, always means value stream management, to maintain clarity. To further minimize the potential for confusion, this book will always spell out the term <em class="italic">value stream mapping</em> or shorten it to <em class="italic">VS map</em> or <em class="italic">VS mapping</em>.</p>
			<p>While James Martin defined the term <em class="italic">value stream</em>, he tended to use the term <em class="italic">value stream reinvention</em> when describing the activities' processes to improve value streams. Martin took issue with using the term <em class="italic">process</em> and the notion<a id="_idIndexMarker373"/> of <strong class="bold">business process reengineering</strong> (<strong class="bold">BPR</strong>).</p>
			<p>In the first case, Martin believed the word <em class="italic">process</em> is too generic and too far removed from the Lean concepts of adding customer-centric value. His primary issue with the term <em class="italic">BPR</em> was that he felt most of his era's processes were never <em class="italic">engineered</em> in the first place. Instead, most business processes evolved to support hierarchical business structures, where the activities often had more to do with protecting organizational fiefdoms and authorities than improving efficiencies.</p>
			<p>Other authors later introduced the term <em class="italic">VSM</em> in their books, including the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em class="italic">Value Stream Management. Eight Steps to Planning, Mapping, and Sustaining Lean Improvements</em>. <em class="italic">Don Tapping</em>, <em class="italic">Tom Luyster</em>, and <em class="italic">Tom Shuker</em> (<em class="italic">Lean Production</em>, <em class="italic">2002</em>). </li>
				<li><em class="italic">Value Stream Management for the Lean Office. Eight Steps to Planning, Mapping, and Sustaining Lean Improvements in Administrative Areas</em>. <em class="italic">Don Tapping</em> and <em class="italic">Tom Shuker</em> (<em class="italic">Lean for the Office</em>, <em class="italic">2003</em>).</li>
				<li><em class="italic">Value Stream Management. Strategy and Excellence in the Supply Chain</em>. <em class="italic">Peter Hines</em>, <em class="italic">Richard Lamming</em>, <em class="italic">Dan Jones</em>, <em class="italic">Paul Cousins</em>, <em class="italic">Nick Rich</em>  (<em class="italic">Prentice Hall/Pearson Education</em>. <em class="italic">Harlow</em>, <em class="italic">England</em>, <em class="italic">2000</em>).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Tom Shuker was kind enough to grant the rights to use their eight-step process for this chapter as an example<a id="_idIndexMarker374"/> of how to implement a VSM strategy across an organization. The eight-step VSM process helps organizations simplify the fundamental<a id="_idIndexMarker375"/> Lean concepts of demand, flow, and leveling via Lean planning, and helps implement the overall process to accelerate, coordinate, and sustain Lean efforts.</p>
			<p>Yes—this is a book about the application of VSM-to-IT transformations. But ask yourself this: in a digital economy, which business value stream exactly are we improving? To answer this question, let's revisit James Martin's original and seminal writings on this subject.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-93"><a id="_idTextAnchor112"/>Identifying value streams</h1>
			<p>James Martin fundamentally understood why a business organization invests in IT to implement and sustain superior<a id="_idIndexMarker376"/> business processes that support its value streams. Martin was ahead of his time, but his ideas persist—for example, <strong class="bold">The Open Group Architecture Framework</strong> (<strong class="bold">TOGAF</strong>) still<a id="_idIndexMarker377"/> employs James Martin's value stream concepts in their <em class="italic">Business<a id="_idTextAnchor113"/> Architecture</em> standard (<em class="italic">Open Group Guide</em>, <em class="italic">Value Streams</em>, January 2017).</p>
			<p>But what exactly did James Martin<a id="_idIndexMarker378"/> mean when he employed the term <em class="italic">value stream</em>? Martin was not merely looking for ways to improve IT development and operational processes. Instead, his goal was to help organizations restructure their value streams and implement software applications to support, sustain, and continuously improve value delivery across all value streams.</p>
			<p>In his book, James Martin cites research from a study published by T. H. Davenport titled <em class="italic">Process Innovation</em>, which identified an average of 14 value streams across 5 large enterprise companies. The companies included <strong class="bold">IBM</strong>, <strong class="bold">Ameritech</strong>, <strong class="bold">Dow Chemical</strong>, <strong class="bold">Xerox</strong>, and a major—though unidentified—insurance company (Harvard Business School Press: Boston, 1993).</p>
			<p>Martin synthesized the works found in Davenport's paper to identify 17 typical value streams (Martin, 1995, page 107). His list of 17 conventional business value streams<a id="_idIndexMarker379"/> includes the following: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer engagement</strong>: Acquiring customers, determining their needs; selling, ensuring that they are pleased</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Order fulfillment</strong>: Receiving orders, fulfilling orders, collecting payment</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer services</strong>: Providing customers with services such as help using the product, planning, and consulting</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Manufacturing</strong>: Production of goods, maintenance of inventory, interaction with suppliers</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Procurement services</strong>: Assistance in supplier selection, contracting, and management</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Product-design engineering</strong>: Designing products and facilities for manufacturing them</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Research</strong>: Exploration of potentially valuable science and technology</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Marketing</strong>: Determining what customers need, which products to build, which features are needed; advertising</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Market-information capture</strong>: Acquisition of information about sales; locating intelligence about the competition</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Product maintenance</strong>: Repairing products and preventative maintenance on customer sites</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Legal department</strong>: Solving legal problems; writing contracts</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">IT- application development</strong>: Developing and modifying systems and software</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">IT infrastructure</strong>: Building the corporate-wide network, database, and facilities for distributed computing</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Human resources</strong> (<strong class="bold">HR</strong>): Assistance in recruiting, training, compensation, care planning</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Leased and capital asset management</strong>: Management of buildings and capital resources</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Financial management</strong>: Accounting, negotiating<a id="_idIndexMarker380"/> with banks, cash management</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enterprise engineering</strong>: Designing, implementing, and improving value streams; engineering the enterprise learning processes </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we have a better understanding of typical business-oriented value streams, it's essential to understand how we establish their boundaries and their interfaces.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-94"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>Establishing value stream boundaries</h2>
			<p>Each value stream has specific starting<a id="_idIndexMarker381"/> and ending activities that establish its boundaries. This concept is so important that some in the <strong class="bold">business architecture</strong> community refer to their value streams by their start and end activities (for example, <strong class="bold">Prospect to Order</strong> and <strong class="bold">Order to Delivery</strong> value streams). James Martin<a id="_idIndexMarker382"/> provides<a id="_idIndexMarker383"/> examples of start and end activities for selected value streams. </p>
			<p>The following table shows a list of value stream naming conventions from Martin's book (Martin, 1995, page 108, exhibit 7.3):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer036" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.3 – VS naming conventions</p>
			<p>Now that you understand how to apply value stream boundaries<a id="_idIndexMarker384"/> and naming conventions, let's look at how value stream improvements help deliver business value.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>Improving business value</h2>
			<p>It's important to remember<a id="_idIndexMarker385"/> that James Martin wrote his book <em class="italic">The Great Transition</em> when virtually all businesses were still in the early stages<a id="_idIndexMarker386"/> of employing IT to support their critical business processes. Don Tapscott coined the term <em class="italic">digital economy</em> in his book titled <em class="italic">The Digital Economy: Promise and Peril in the Age of Networked Intelligence</em> in 1995, which was the same year <em class="italic">The Great Transition</em> was published. But James Martin and others in the BPR and <strong class="bold">business process improvement</strong> (<strong class="bold">BPI</strong>) community<a id="_idIndexMarker387"/> already understood the importance of redesigning or incrementally improving business processes to take advantage of IT's new capabilities.</p>
			<p>Companies must develop more efficient, faster, and responsive organizational value streams in a digital economy, and Martin understood that its IT function had to support those efforts. Martin's view<a id="_idIndexMarker388"/> of value stream reinvention was to replace traditional cross-functional and siloed business processes "<em class="italic">with a new workflow that is fast, simple, automated where possible, and performed by a small team (or person) sharply focused on pleasing the customer</em>" (Martin, 1995, page 64).</p>
			<p>James Martin further notes that value stream reinvention<a id="_idIndexMarker389"/> is an improvement strategy that seeks to answer several fundamental questions, such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What are the organization's value streams?</li>
				<li>Who are the value stream's customers?</li>
				<li>What do those customers want?</li>
				<li>What do we need to do to delight those customers?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As IT specialists working in a digital economy, we must ask ourselves this fundamental question: <em class="italic">How do we employ IT and software applications to support an organization's customer-centric value streams as efficiently, cost-effectively, and quickly as possible?</em> </p>
			<p>From the perspective of Lean, the answer is multifaceted and not extremely difficult to understand at a conceptual level: <em class="italic">An IT organization supports the automation and integration of organizational value stream activities while also improving the accuracy and timeliness of value stream information flows. In many cases, IT also supports the implementation of digital features and functions within physical products.</em></p>
			<p>We now understand the importance of leveraging IT to improve the delivery of business value. Let's now move on to understand why an organization's chief executives must drive the effort.  </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor116"/>Leading the change</h2>
			<p>Lean strategies are not easy to implement. Lean development and delivery activities often require some degree of structural changes<a id="_idIndexMarker390"/> to an organization and its facilities, the implementation of new business processes and equipment, the development of new skills, and investment in IT. Only the organization's chief or <strong class="bold">line-of-business</strong> (<strong class="bold">LOB</strong>) executives can authorize such changes.</p>
			<p>In support of enterprise-scale Lean initiatives, making informed IT investments in skills and tools is a primary topic of this book. Unfortunately, changing organizational structures, developing new skills, and investing in new IT methods and tools remains difficult. There are innumerable technology<a id="_idIndexMarker391"/> and product options to investigate, most requiring additional time and resources devoted to configuration and integration tasks.</p>
			<p>These are the areas where leadership must step up. As with other enterprise Lean initiatives, only executive leadership can direct a VSM strategy and make the necessary tooling, infrastructure, integration, and configuration investments. Adding DevOps into the mix increases those investment costs. We'll get to that topic (that is, investments in DevOps tools, infrastructure, integration, and configurations) later, in <a href="B17087_06_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Launching the VSM Initiative (VSM Steps 1-3)</em>.</p>
			<p>CI, CD, and DevOps capabilities have evolved to the point where an IT department can better support the ideas promoted by James Martin back in the 1990s; plus, VSM offers a set of methods and tools to guide and help sustain an organization's Lean transformations. Nevertheless, all these capabilities require investments, and executive leadership must gain sufficient knowledge to make informed investment decisions. </p>
			<p>You may not be a chief executive or a LOB executive, but you can still help provide education, thought leadership, and support in whatever position or role you have within the organization. An organization's success with its Lean initiatives depends on everyone's participation and support.</p>
			<p>For the sake of argument, we'll assume the organization has executive-level support and the willingness to make the necessary structural alignments, install trained mentors and coaches, and invest in the necessary technology and tools. The next question, then, is: <em class="italic">How to initiate and execute a continuing VSM strategy?</em> That is the topic of the final section of this chapter. But before we get to that subject, let's take a quick look at an essential VSM visualization and analysis tool, <strong class="bold">value stream mapping</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor117"/>Mapping the value stream</h2>
			<p>The purpose of this section is to explain the importance of value stream<a id="_idIndexMarker392"/> mapping. Later, in <a href="B17087_07_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor183"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Mapping the Current State (VSM Step 4)</em>, you will learn how to create a value stream map, a technique to assess current (<em class="italic">as-is state</em>) and future (<em class="italic">to-be state</em>) processes. Value stream mapping helps the VSM team evaluate the scope of work required to transition to a desired future state of streamlined value stream activities, minima<a id="_idTextAnchor118"/>l waste, and customer-centric value. We will continue to use value stream mapping to help guide and prioritize our CI activities.</p>
			<p>Toyota originated value stream mapping techniques, <a id="_idTextAnchor119"/>but they referred to the practice as <em class="italic">materials and information flow mapping</em>. In other words, Toyota understood that even when analyzing manufacturing processes, the improvement of information flows was every bit as important as improving material flows. </p>
			<p>Timely and accurate information is required to support the material flows within a manufacturing organization. If information is not flowing correctly, production processes are delayed when the right materials do not arrive at the right time and in the right amounts to support the Lean production processes. Of course, customer order information must flow with the materials to ensure the fabrication of the correct set of products for each customer.</p>
			<p>James Martin was also an early proponent<a id="_idIndexMarker393"/> of mapping value streams, and he devoted an entire chapter to the subject of value stream mapping in <a href="B17087_08_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor209"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a> of his book <em class="italic">The Great Transition</em> (Martin, 1995). However, Martin's approach precedes the modern value stream diagramming techniques introduced by Mike Rother and John Shook in their book, <em class="italic">Learning to See</em> (Rother, Shook, 1999).</p>
			<p>This book teaches the modern value stream mapping approaches set down by Rother and Shook and later updated by Karen Martin and Mike Osterling in their book <em class="italic">Value Stream Mapping: How to Visualize Work and Align Leadership for Organizational Transformation</em> (Martin, Osterling, 2014). Modern value stream maps provide a combination of activity and information flow data necessary to assess the state of Leanness across the value stream. In contrast, James Martin's value streams incorporate a fairly traditional process flow diagramming technique. </p>
			<p>Whichever modeling techniques your organization may prefer, make sure it's a standardized approach and that everyone is trained on the techniques employed. Otherwise, the VSM team can expect issues in their communications, interpretations, and analysis. </p>
			<p>At this point in our discussions on value streams, it's essential to understand this fundamental concept: <strong class="bold">all value streams represent an end-to-end flow of value across an organization</strong>. In this context, a Lean value stream operates similarly to the mass production concepts behind Henry Ford's first Model T assembly lines. A critical difference is that Lean incorporates pull-oriented production and order management production processes versus a push-based production control strategy. Forgetting the concepts of push-versus-pull production control strategies for a moment, mass production and Lean production share the notion of synchronizing and automating flows. </p>
			<p>For example, a customer order documents a new requirement, which initiates the production or delivery of a product. The construction follows a value stream flow around an initial component, such as the frame of a car in the previously mentioned Model T car production example. Another example is the construction of a frame or chassis for a laptop<a id="_idIndexMarker394"/> or server at the start of a computer-system assembly process. In either example, as the frames traverse the activities along the production line, additional components of value are added to the product in the form of materials, parts, and information. In the lexicon of Lean, we add value to a product at every step along the value stream process. </p>
			<p>The following screenshot depicts a display of a modern automobile assembly line. Despite the use of robotic technology and other automation capabilities, the basic concepts behind Henry Ford's original mass production concept as an end-to-end and synchronized process remain: </p>

			<p>This book is not about how to implement Lean processes in manufacturing—there are many other good sources for that type of information. However, we will discuss the application of VSM to development-oriented processes, of which an assembly line is an example. Additionally, we will also discuss the use of VSM to support operations-oriented value streams, which have more to do with front-office and back-office processes.</p>
			<p>As noted previously, front-office operational processes are customer-facing, while back-office operational processes are typically administrative. As with development and operations-oriented value streams, all business processes can be made Lean and improved by applying VSM methods and tools.</p>
			<p>Having used the terms <em class="italic">front office</em> and <em class="italic">back office</em>, please note that you may very well decide there is no such thing in your organization to evaluate the activities that add value from your customers' perspective. Value streams<a id="_idIndexMarker395"/> are not bound by organizational hierarchies, skills, or business functions. Value streams are an end-to-end set of activities required to deliver value from an initial request through delivery. Their customers can be either internal or external to the organization.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we explore how to implement VSM practices as a structured process consisting of eight steps. However, before moving on to that chapter, let's first take a quick look at the eight VSM steps for planning, mapping, and sustaining Lean practices.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>Applying VSM methods and tools</h1>
			<p>Every VSM tool vendor<a id="_idIndexMarker396"/> has its unique VSM process, usually tailored to its business origins and its software tools' focus or strength. We don't need software tools to implement VSM capabilities, though they are a huge enabler. Still, before we invest in VSM tools, we must first learn the basic concepts and approaches behind the implementation of VSM practices.</p>
			<p>VSM implementations, as described in this book, follow an eight-step process outlined by Don Tapping, Tom Luyster, and Tom Shuker in their <em class="italic">Value Stream Management</em> books (Tapping, Luyster, Shuker, 2002; Tapping, Shuker, 2003). Specifically, the eight steps walk an organization through a VSM process to plan, map, and sustain Lean improvements. </p>
			<p>The following screenshot introduces the eight VSM steps: </p>

			<p>In contrast to Tapping's, Luyster's, and Shuker's books, whose focus lay in Lean management, Lean healthcare, and Lean offices, this book focuses on applying VSM to IT. However, <em class="italic">please note</em> that IT touches<a id="_idIndexMarker397"/> on everything going on within an organization in a digital economy. Moreover, as James Martin indicates, IT's role is to support an organization's process and value stream reinvention<a id="_idIndexMarker398"/> through Lean initiatives. Therefore, <em class="italic">any VSM initiative is likely to include planning, mapping, improvement, and sustainment activities as a participatory value stream, but not necessarily as the primary value stream.</em></p>
			<p>The preceding paragraph makes a critical point. Almost all modern VSM tools focus on modeling the DevOps process to show concepts. Improving the DevOps value stream is important. However, the more considerable benefits of VSM come from linking DevOps activities in support of enterprise Lean initiatives outside the IT function, including both operations and development-oriented value streams. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/>Defining the eight steps of VSM</h1>
			<p>Tom Shuker was kind enough<a id="_idIndexMarker399"/> to allow me to incorporate their <strong class="bold">eight-step VSM process</strong> for this book. Before we end this chapter and get into the details of executing their VSM strategy, we'll take a quick look at how Tapping and Shuker defined their eight steps for planning, mapping, and sustainin<a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>g Lean improvements, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Commit to Lean</strong> (<em class="italic">Step 1</em>): A successful Lean initiative requires executive leadership and buy-in from employees and stakeholders. Everyone involved in the VSM initiative must understand the importance of Lean practices to provide a more sustainable business through value delivery. The goal of Lean is to extend the value of HR and not eliminate jobs or take shortcuts.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Choose value stream</strong> (<em class="italic">Step 2</em>): We can't implement and improve Lean practices organization-wide overnight. It takes time and effort to identify and implement value<a id="_idIndexMarker400"/> stream improvements, with priorities based on the work that adds the most value for the lowest costs. Moreover, the VSM team keeps identifying and working on new improvement priorities across the product's life.  </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Learn about Lean</strong> (<em class="italic">Step 3</em>): VSM is all about improving Lean practices across the organization's value streams. So, all VSM team members and the employees assigned to work within a value stream must have superior knowledge of the day-to-day practices of operating Lean production systems.  </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Map current state</strong> (<em class="italic">Step 4</em>): It's dangerous to begin to adjust a system before fully understanding how it operates. We need to understand how our work flows across the value stream, how much of our work is value-adding, and how much time is spent on value-added activities versus waiting. Finally, we need to identify other forms of waste that add to our costs without adding value. These are the goals when mapping the current state of our development or operations-oriented business practices.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Identify Lean metrics</strong> (<em class="italic">Step 5</em>): With the current value stream map completed, the VSM team turns its attention to identifying metrics that can help the organization achieve its business goals. We can't evaluate our future VSM efforts' success if we don't first identify our customers' needs, potential areas of waste, and our value stream's productivity goals. Meeting customer needs and eliminating waste provides the surest path to lower costs and obtaining a business-sustaining product price.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Map future state</strong> (<em class="italic">Step 6a</em>)—<strong class="bold">Customer demand</strong>: This is the first of three phases to build our plan for a desired future state. The goal is to assess customer demand for our products and services. In this mapping exercise, we input the previously identified Lean metrics for acceptable quality, demand in terms of units, and desired lead times. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Map future state</strong> (<em class="italic">Step 6b</em>)—<strong class="bold">Continuous flow</strong>: This is the second phase in future state mapping. The goal here is to standardize how work is performed and figure out how to organize the flow of work, materials, parts, and information to move continuously. In many if not most cases, it may be necessary to move equipment and office cubicles to affect better flows. Information systems are another<a id="_idIndexMarker401"/> critical enabler to help establish the efficient flow of information across value stream activities. Steps should also be taken to level the flow of work by minimizing variances between activity setup, changeover, and cycle times. Finally, we should decide which production control strategies to implement, such as <strong class="bold">Just-in-Time</strong> (<strong class="bold">JIT</strong>), <strong class="bold">First In, First Out</strong> (<strong class="bold">FIFO</strong>), and Kanban. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Map future state</strong> (<em class="italic">Step 6c</em>)—<strong class="bold">Leveling</strong>: This is the final phase of future state mapping. At this stage, we should have installed Lean practices across our value stream and minimized the more critical elements of waste affecting our productivity. We now need to implement strategies to level the flow of customer demand. This VSM work involves implementing pull-based strategies to minimize excessive queuing and waiting, reduce lot sizes to minimize queues and wait times associated with batch processes, and implement our value stream's delivery and pickup systems—that is, Kanban Cards or Kanban folders, and work items. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Create Kaizen plans</strong> (<em class="italic">Step 7</em>): VSM implements Lean-oriented changes, both large and small in scale. A Kaizen plan outlines our strategies for continuously improving our development and operations-oriented value streams, but many of the Lean-oriented investments require significant investments that the VSM team cannot authorize. Moreover, the scope of planned changes may require multiple planning horizons to implement, and their Kaizen plans may evolve over time. Therefore, the VSM team needs to create a change plan (Kaizen plan) to make visible and manage the planned scope of change.<p>A key differentiator between Lean and Agile is that Lean evaluates all potential areas for improvement, regardless of the investments, authorities, time, and resources required. In contrast, Agile retrospectives tend to focus on what the small Agile team can authorize and accomplish over the next Sprint iteration. </p><p>Both Lean and Agile practitioners understand the importance of continuous change. Still, VSM emphasizes much longer-term planning horizons and potentially includes changes that require more capital investments than those contemplated in Agile-based retrospectives. </p><p>Finally, requirements, issues, and priorities change over time, therefore Kaizen plans need to be periodically reviewed and updated. Creating and modifying your Kaizen plans are the primary activities of this step. </p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Implement Kaizen plans</strong> (<em class="italic">Step 8</em>): Finally, we need to implement whatever Kaizen plans we created. Additionally, we need to review and update them as necessary, but<a id="_idIndexMarker402"/> frequently. One constant in business is continuous change, so we need to continually improve our Lean practices and maintain alignment with our customers' needs.  We also need to continually evaluate how we plan to improve our value stream activities by discovering and eliminating additional waste. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now that we've introduced the eight essential steps to plan, map, and sustain Lean improvements, let's take a closer look at what goes on in each step, starting with the commitment to Lean. That is the topic of the next chapter. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This ends the introductory chapter to VSM. You have learned that VSM provides an approach to evaluate all development and operational value streams methodically and continuously. The goal of VSM is to ensure an organization remains in alignment with corporate strategies and adds customer-centric value. </p>
			<p>You've also learned VSM is not a new concept and that the concepts and practices support the implementation and sustainment of Lean production practices across an organization's value streams. Organizations typically have many value streams. James Martin, an IT leader, provided a comprehensive discussion on the need for an end-to-end reinvention of business processes in the form of value streams. Martin was also an early proponent of value stream mapping, though his approach preceded the modern format we'll use in <a href="B17087_06_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Launching the VSM Initiative (VSM Steps 1-3)</em>, on mapping and improving value streams.</p>
			<p>Finally, you can now identify the eight VSM steps to plan, map, and sustain Lean improvements across your value streams. In the next chapter, we move on to learn how to execute the steps associated with VSM planning, including making a commitment to Lean, choosing a value stream for your VSM initiative, and learning about Lean. </p>
