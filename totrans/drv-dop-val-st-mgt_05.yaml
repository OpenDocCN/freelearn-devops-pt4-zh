    and making the Lean development and delivery processes a way of life. VSM is applied
    to streamline development and operations-oriented work to deliver customer-centric
    value more efficiently in modern Lean practices. In this context, IT-based development
    and operations activities are organizational value streams that similarly benefit
    from employing VSM capabilities.

    the implementation of **continuous integration** (**CI**) and **continuous delivery**
    (**CD**) capabilities, often as part of a larger **DevOps** process integration,
    automation, and collaboration strategy. Put another way, the use of VSM to drive
    DevOps development and delivery capabilities is essentially an organization's
    Lean value stream implementation strategy for IT value delivery.

    Therefore, VSM practices cannot focus simply on improving IT value streams. Instead,
    IT-oriented VSM helps improve all value stream activities enterprise-wide. Moreover,
    since organizational value streams are often linked, we must improve customer
    delivery flows across all connected value streams.

    product in our scenario, so they go online to a vendor's website to check out
    the available options. While on the site, they decide what they want to purchase
    and submit the order. The order triggers other value stream activities to place
    the order, make and receive payments, update accounting systems, order replacement
    materials, execute production, and eventually execute the organization's downstream
    fulfillment or provisioning and support processes. Along the way, IT systems are
    initiating the processes from start to finish while ensuring the correct information
    and materials show up at the right time and in the right place. Thus, all organizational
    value streams are linked to some degree, with the IT value stream serving as an
    essential enabler.

    development practices in his book *The Great Transition: Using the Seven Disciplines
    of Enterprise Engineering to Align People, Technology, and Strategy* (Martin,
    1995). Martin''s book was published less than a year after James Womack and Daniel

    the term *value stream mapping* or shorten it to *VS map* or *VS mapping*.

    *engineered* in the first place. Instead, most business processes evolved to support
    hierarchical business structures, where the activities often had more to do with
    protecting organizational fiefdoms and authorities than improving efficiencies.

    processes are delayed when the right materials do not arrive at the right time
    and in the right amounts to support the Lean production processes. Of course,
    customer order information must flow with the materials to ensure the fabrication
    of the correct set of products for each customer.

    of his book *The Great Transition* (Martin, 1995). However, Martin's approach

    this fundamental concept: **all value streams represent an end-to-end flow of
    value across an organization**. In this context, a Lean value stream operates
    similarly to the mass production concepts behind Henry Ford''s first Model T assembly
    lines. A critical difference is that Lean incorporates pull-oriented production
    and order management production processes versus a push-based production control
    strategy. Forgetting the concepts of push-versus-pull production control strategies
    for a moment, mass production and Lean production share the notion of synchronizing
    and automating flows.'

    production or delivery of a product. The construction follows a value stream flow
    around an initial component, such as the frame of a car in the previously mentioned
    Model T car production example. Another example is the construction of a frame
    or chassis for a laptop or server at the start of a computer-system assembly process.
    In either example, as the frames traverse the activities along the production
    line, additional components of value are added to the product in the form of materials,
    parts, and information. In the lexicon of Lean, we add value to a product at every
    step along the value stream process.

    are many other good sources for that type of information. However, we will discuss
    the application of VSM to development-oriented processes, of which an assembly
    line is an example. Additionally, we will also discuss the use of VSM to support
    operations-oriented value streams, which have more to do with front-office and
    back-office processes.

    may very well decide there is no such thing in your organization to evaluate the
    activities that add value from your customers' perspective. Value streams are
    not bound by organizational hierarchies, skills, or business functions. Value
    streams are an end-to-end set of activities required to deliver value from an
    initial request through delivery. Their customers can be either internal or external
    to the organization.

    VSM to IT. However, *please note* that IT touches on everything going on within
    an organization in a digital economy. Moreover, as James Martin indicates, IT's
    role is to support an organization's process and value stream reinvention through
    Lean initiatives. Therefore, *any VSM initiative is likely to include planning,
    mapping, improvement, and sustainment activities as a participatory value stream,
    but not necessarily as the primary value stream.*

    focus on modeling the DevOps process to show concepts. Improving the DevOps value
    stream is important. However, the more considerable benefits of VSM come from
    linking DevOps activities in support of enterprise Lean initiatives outside the
    IT function, including both operations and development-oriented value streams.

    and office cubicles to affect better flows. Information systems are another critical
    enabler to help establish the efficient flow of information across value stream
    activities. Steps should also be taken to level the flow of work by minimizing
    variances between activity setup, changeover, and cycle times. Finally, we should
