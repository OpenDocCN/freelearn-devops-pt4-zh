    to streamline development and operations-oriented work to deliver customer-centric
    value more efficiently in modern Lean practices. In this context, IT-based development

    (**CD**) capabilities, often as part of a larger **DevOps** process integration,
    automation, and collaboration strategy. Put another way, the use of VSM to drive
    DevOps development and delivery capabilities is essentially an organization's
    Lean value stream implementation strategy for IT value delivery.

    Therefore, VSM practices cannot focus simply on improving IT value streams. Instead,
    IT-oriented VSM helps improve all value stream activities enterprise-wide. Moreover,

- en: Let's look at a quick example. A customer is interested in purchasing a customizable
    product in our scenario, so they go online to a vendor's website to check out
    the available options. While on the site, they decide what they want to purchase
    and submit the order. The order triggers other value stream activities to place
    the order, make and receive payments, update accounting systems, order replacement
    materials, execute production, and eventually execute the organization's downstream
    fulfillment or provisioning and support processes. Along the way, IT systems are
    initiating the processes from start to finish while ensuring the correct information
    and materials show up at the right time and in the right place. Thus, all organizational
    value streams are linked to some degree, with the IT value stream serving as an
    essential enabler.

- en: '**Frontend processes** directly help the customer, while backend processes
    include all internal support activities that don''t require face-to-face interactions.

    IT to implement and sustain superior business processes that support its value
    streams. Martin was ahead of his time, but his ideas persist—for example, **The
    Open Group Architecture Framework** (**TOGAF**) still employs James Martin's value
    stream concepts in their *Business Architecture* standard (*Open Group Guide*,
    *Value Streams*, January 2017).

    Martin was not merely looking for ways to improve IT development and operational
    processes. Instead, his goal was to help organizations restructure their value
    streams and implement software applications to support, sustain, and continuously
    improve value delivery across all value streams.

    of his book *The Great Transition* (Martin, 1995). However, Martin's approach

    this fundamental concept: **all value streams represent an end-to-end flow of
    value across an organization**. In this context, a Lean value stream operates
    similarly to the mass production concepts behind Henry Ford''s first Model T assembly
    lines. A critical difference is that Lean incorporates pull-oriented production
    and order management production processes versus a push-based production control
    strategy. Forgetting the concepts of push-versus-pull production control strategies
    for a moment, mass production and Lean production share the notion of synchronizing

    production or delivery of a product. The construction follows a value stream flow
    around an initial component, such as the frame of a car in the previously mentioned
    Model T car production example. Another example is the construction of a frame
    or chassis for a laptop or server at the start of a computer-system assembly process.
    In either example, as the frames traverse the activities along the production
    line, additional components of value are added to the product in the form of materials,
    parts, and information. In the lexicon of Lean, we add value to a product at every
    step along the value stream process.

    time is spent on value-added activities versus waiting. Finally, we need to identify

    to move continuously. In many if not most cases, it may be necessary to move equipment
    and office cubicles to affect better flows. Information systems are another critical
    enabler to help establish the efficient flow of information across value stream
    activities. Steps should also be taken to level the flow of work by minimizing
    variances between activity setup, changeover, and cycle times. Finally, we should
    decide which production control strategies to implement, such as **Just-in-Time**
    (**JIT**), **First In, First Out** (**FIFO**), and Kanban.'

    We now need to implement strategies to level the flow of customer demand. This
    VSM work involves implementing pull-based strategies to minimize excessive queuing
    and waiting, reduce lot sizes to minimize queues and wait times associated with
    batch processes, and implement our value stream''s delivery and pickup systems—that

    an approach to evaluate all development and operational value streams methodically

    support the implementation and sustainment of Lean production practices across
    an organization's value streams. Organizations typically have many value streams.
    James Martin, an IT leader, provided a comprehensive discussion on the need for
    an end-to-end reinvention of business processes in the form of value streams.
    Martin was also an early proponent of value stream mapping, though his approach
    preceded the modern format we'll use in [*Chapter 6*](B17087_06_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165),
