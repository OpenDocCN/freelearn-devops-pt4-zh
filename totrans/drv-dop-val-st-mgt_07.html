			<p>This part of the book introduces value stream management (VSM) as a generic methodology that can be applied to help identify, prioritize, and plan value stream improvements across the enterprise and any value stream. It is also the largest part of the book, given the scope of the work involved when implementing and improving Lean production capabilities across IT and other organizational value streams. </p>
			<p>In a modern context, VSM tools support Lean improvements across an organization's IT value streams, intending to improve software delivery capabilities via DevOps-based pipelines. But tools are only part of the industry's VSM solution's needs. The IT industry also needs to adopt a proven VSM methodology to get the most value from their VSM tools. </p>
			<p>With this goal in mind, chapters 6 through 10 introduce a robust and proven VSM methodology and apply it to an IT-based CI/CD pipeline implementation strategy as a sample use case. </p>
			<p>VSM is not a new concept, and the techniques have been applied to implementing Lean improvements in manufacturing, supply chain administration, office administration, and healthcare administration. But the application of VSM to address productivity and value delivery issues across IT value streams is a relatively new concept. </p>
			<p>Despite its new adoption by the IT community, VSM concepts and tools are gaining traction rapidly in the IT community. For example, Gartner reports that by 2023, 70% of organizations will use VSM to improve flow in their DevOps pipeline, leading to faster delivery of customer value.</p>
			<p>In our modern digital world, IT touches nearly every aspect of the business. Therefore, improvements to an organization's IT value delivery capabilities also help improve nearly all aspects of the business.</p>
