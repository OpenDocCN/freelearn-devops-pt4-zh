    methodology that can be applied to help identify, prioritize, and plan value stream
    improvements across the enterprise and any value stream. It is also the largest

    IT value streams, intending to improve software delivery capabilities via DevOps-based
    pipelines. But tools are only part of the industry's VSM solution's needs. The
    IT industry also needs to adopt a proven VSM methodology to get the most value
    from their VSM tools.
