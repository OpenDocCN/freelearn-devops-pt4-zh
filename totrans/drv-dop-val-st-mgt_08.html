			<p>In the preceding chapter, you learned that <strong class="bold">value stream management</strong> (<strong class="bold">VSM</strong>) provides an approach to systematically and continuously evaluate all development and operational value streams. A VSM initiative's objective is to ensure that the organization remains aligned with corporate strategies while adding customer-centric value. You also learned the eight essential steps that support a VSM team in their efforts to plan, map, and sustain Lean improvements.  </p>
			<p>Understanding the fundamentals of VSM is critical as every <strong class="bold">Information Technology</strong> (<strong class="bold">IT</strong>)-based VSM initiative must support the organization's broader objectives to build and sustain a Lean enterprise. This chapter instructs how to apply the first three VSM steps. You will learn how to conduct the remaining five VSM steps in <a href="B17087_06_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a><em class="italic">, Launching the VSM Initiative (VSM Steps 1-3),</em> through <a href="B17087_10_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor272"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Improving the Lean-Agile Value Delivery Cycle (VSM Steps 7 and 8)</em>, where you will learn how to map, analyze, and improve your value streams.</p>
			<p>This part of the book incorporates a <strong class="bold">continuous integration/continuous delivery</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>) pipeline flow use case through <a href="B17087_05_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor126"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a><em class="italic">, Driving Business Value through a DevOps Pipeline</em> through <a href="B17087_10_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor272"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a><em class="italic">, Improving the Lean-Agile Value Delivery Cycle (VSM Steps 7 and 8)</em>. The use case will help you visualize how to employ the VSM methodology in a practical IT-oriented value stream application. Here, in this initial chapter, the focus is on learning the fundamental elements of preparing to initiate a VSM activity. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Committing to Lean—VSM Step 1</li>
				<li>Choosing a value stream—VSM Step 2</li>
				<li>Learning about Lean—VSM Step 3</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor166"/>Committing to Lean – VSM Step 1</h1>
			<p>VSM is about making Lean improvements across organizational value streams. Most VSM initiatives impact investments and decision-making at the strategic and portfolio levels of planning. Therefore, we need executive and stakeholder commitments to Lean to be successful with VSM. That is the topic of this first section.</p>
			<p>It should be evident that an organization cannot be serious about employing VSM if they are not serious about implementing Lean production (development) and delivery (operations) practices. If your VSM initiative is only about improving the DevOps value stream, the organization has missed the point. VSM is about implementing and sustaining Lean practices across all value streams, and ultimately on an enterprise scale.</p>
			<p>Before we decide to commit to Lean, we should understand something about its origins and purpose. That is the topic of the next subsection.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor167"/>Navigating the origins of Lean</h2>
			<p>The origins of Lean trace back to Henry Ford's early automotive assembly lines and early mass-production concepts. Henry Ford's approach significantly improved productivity and quality with lower costs, but his assembly-line approach did not allow product-line variants. </p>
			<p>For example, his early assembly lines limited his automotive products to just one color  (black), one model (the Model T), and only one specification for each assembled part. There was no accommodation to assemble different types, body styles, colors, chassis, or other automotive parts. </p>
			<p>Later, and through the efforts of Kiichiro Toyoda, Ohno Taiichi, Sakichi Toyoda, and Shigeo Shingo, Toyota improved Henry Ford's assembly-line and mass-production concepts to maintain continuous flows while supporting multiple product-line variations. Toyota's contributions to Lean production concepts are manifold, have evolved over decades, and continue to evolve.</p>
			<p>The efforts started in 1930 when Kiichiro Toyoda implemented the concept of <strong class="bold">Just-In-Time</strong> (<strong class="bold">JIT</strong>) to improve the utilization of scarce and costly resources and eliminate waste that does not add value to the production process. Put most succinctly, JIT is about making only what's needed, only when it's needed.  </p>
			<p>Ohno Taiichia, Sakichi Toyoda, and Kiichiro Toyoda improved the JIT concept and implemented the concept behind <strong class="bold">Jidoka</strong>, roughly translated as <strong class="bold">autonomation</strong>, based on autonomous and automation. JIT and Jidoka form the two pillars of the <strong class="bold">Toyota Production System</strong> (<strong class="bold">TPS</strong>). Shigeo Shingo worked for Toyota, implemented its <strong class="bold">Single-Minute Exchange of Dies</strong> (<strong class="bold">SMED</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Poka-Yoke</strong> (mistake-proofing) concepts, and published the first detailed assessment of Toyota's production processes. That book is titled <em class="italic">A Study of the Toyota Production System</em> (Shingo, Dillon; 2005—English translation).</p>
			<p>In its modern form, the TPS, now known as the <em class="italic">Toyota Way</em>, involves JIT manufacturing, elimination of waste, and continuous improvement (Kaizen), but Toyota did not come up with the term <em class="italic">Lean</em>. </p>
			<p>John Krafcik gets credit for defining the term <em class="italic">Lean</em> in his paper, <em class="italic">Triumph of the Lean Production System</em>, published in <em class="italic">Sloan Management Review</em> (1988). The paper describes his research while working on his <strong class="bold">Master of Business Administration</strong> (<strong class="bold">MBA</strong>) at <strong class="bold">Massachusetts Institute of Technology's</strong> (<strong class="bold">MIT's</strong>) Sloan School of Management and simultaneously working at the MIT <strong class="bold">International Motor Vehicle Program</strong> (<strong class="bold">IMVP</strong>) as a Lean production researcher and consultant. </p>
			<p>Under the direction of James P. Womack, John Krafcik and the IMVP team researched more than 90 auto manufacturing companies across 15 countries to understand how Lean practices could help Western manufacturing companies compete with their Japanese counterparts employing Toyota's TPC concepts. Womack published the results of the IMPV research in his book <em class="italic">The Machine That Changed the World</em> (Womack, Jones, Roos; 1990).</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor168"/>Linking Lean to value delivery</h2>
			<p>The Lean enterprise seeks to achieve world-class value-delivery capabilities. Lean organizations reduce costs wherever possible, produce the highest-quality products in the industry, meet delivery requirements, and eliminate all waste from their customers' value streams. </p>
			<p>VSM team members understand their responsibility is to help improve organizational value streams and simultaneously help the organization meet its customers' needs better than anyone else in the industry. They achieve these goals by facilitating Lean-oriented improvements across organizational value streams.</p>
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor169"/>Lean companies are more competitive than others by continuously improving their business operations. Lean enterprises are more employee-friendly by showing respect for their work and delegating responsibilities to the people doing the work. These employee-friendly strategies help minimize the bureaucracy and hierarchical organizational structures that get in the way of productivity and that ultimately cause employee stress and burnout. Similarly, Lean management makes commitments to employee training, recognition, communications, and the use of Lean tools.</p>
			<p>World-class organizations operate on a cost reduction principle that never approves passing on higher costs to customers, as operations are streamlined and made more efficient. The goal is to make it impossible for other competitors to take market share through better pricing. World-class organizations strive to produce zero defects and eliminate all waste forms from their value stream activities, further reducing their costs while increasing their competitiveness. </p>
			<p>Lean organizations do not allow managers to push work into a production or operations function until there is available capacity to perform the work. Pushing orders and materials into a production environment faster than its production flow rate only causes waste in the form of inventory carrying costs, waiting, and hidden defects. Therefore, Lean enterprise executives know their employees must pull work into their value streams only when capacity becomes available and that materials, parts, and information must arrive just in time to support the operations, and no sooner. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor170"/>Improving production flows without compromising flexibility</h2>
			<p>The significance of Toyota's work to improve production flows while maintaining flexibility in product variations cannot be understated. Yes—Ford's early assembly lines were efficient and produced high-quality automobiles, but a lack of flexibility in product-line variations left the company open to their competitors, who found ways to achieve efficient flows while still adding customer-centric value. Delivering customer-centric value means we must deliver the product features and capabilities our customers want, when they need them, and at a competitive price.</p>
			<p>Those same lessons apply to our modern IT <strong class="bold">development-operations</strong> (<strong class="bold">DevOps</strong>) practices. Modern CI/CD and DevOps pipelines enable efficient production flows without compromising the organization's ability to build the right products when and as they are needed. Fully automated CI/CD and DevOps pipelines do not constrain the creative aspects of software development, but they do take the drudgery out of performing repetitive and non-value-added activities.</p>
			<p>This section's remaining subsections stress the importance of ongoing communications, management participation, and setting up the proper starting conditions for long-term success. Lean stresses CI in the development and sustainment of production flows. The methods and tools of VSM support the Lean product life cycle commitment process. While this Lean commitment step is just the start of your VSM journey, it's critical to get off to a good start.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor171"/>Installing the right operating system for VSM</h2>
			<p>It's important to note that Toyota never saw the need to move away from their classical hierarchical organizational structures. Instead, as Toyota grew into a global conglomerate, they established regional and product-line divisions with increased decision-making authority granted at the division level. The creation of regional divisions allows each geographic business unit to tailor products and services to meet local market needs. In contrast, the product-line divisions help Toyota develop and maintain its product brands.</p>
			<p>The preservation of executive and functional management positions at the <strong class="bold">line-of-business</strong> (<strong class="bold">LOB</strong>) <strong class="bold">level is not consistent with Lean philosophies</strong>, but Lean production practices also move decision-making to the lowest practical levels of the organization. </p>
			<p>For example, local operators and supervisors best know how things work and areas that can be improved. Value stream teams have the authority to make improvements at a local level that do not involve investments beyond their levels of authority or undue delays in production.  </p>
			<p>That does not leave management and executive levels out of decision-making. In <a href="B17087_07_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor183"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Mapping the Current State (VSM Step 4)</em>, you learn the practice of <strong class="bold">Gemba</strong> (this translates as <em class="italic">the "actual" or "real" place</em>) as a practice for managers and VSM teams to walk the production floors to see what's going on. The value of Gemba is that the managers and executives are already aware and informed of the issues when decision-making needs elevation to higher levels of authority. </p>
			<p>Lean value streams are superimposed across all business functions in hierarchical organizations, and the product lines operate as independent business units. The ideal situation in Lean is to have open communications and constant collaboration among executives, managers, and operators. In a Lean enterprise, communication flows both up and down the hierarchical or divisional business structures.</p>
			<p>It may seem that the preservation of hierarchical organizational structures violates Agile's approach to operating small teams or scaling with <strong class="bold">teams-of-teams</strong> as fully self-contained and mostly autonomous production-delivery structures. However, taking a closer look, Lean value streams have dedicated resources that operate with similar independence and autonomy. </p>
			<p>In Lean, functional management structures, when they exist, support value delivery across all development and operations-oriented value streams. Each value stream may have smaller independent teams that work as semi-autonomous units. Still, they must always remain aligned with supporting Lean-oriented work and information flows across their larger value stream and other interconnected value streams. </p>
			<p>Another critical aspect of making Lean improvements is that executives and managers cannot be the only people coming up with ideas or making decisions in isolation. The people performing the work often have the best ideas on how to improve it. Free-flowing communications and respect for all team members allow those ideas to quickly gain support and propagate up to the decision-makers.</p>
			<p>In his book <em class="italic">Building Strategic Agility for a Faster-Moving World</em> (2014), John Kotter suggests we need two business "operating systems." The dual operating system takes advantage of the large enterprise's economies of scale, not by taking down the functional hierarchies but by superimposing Lean value streams across the management structures. </p>
			<p>The concept of overlaying hierarchical structures with value streams supports digital transformations by aligning resources along value streams. The functional structures help develop and maintain the resources for growth. The development and operations-oriented value streams help improve agility and responsiveness to customer demands and promote investment in emerging business opportunities.</p>
			<p>You now know that VSM is an approach to make Lean improvements continuously, and you know why Lean is such an essential strategy for delivering optimal value from the customer's perspective. Let's now dig in to understand how to initiate and support a VSM initiative.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor172"/>Managing a VSM initiative</h2>
			<p>Executives and managers play a critical role in guiding the Lean enterprise. They are ultimately accountable for a VSM initiative's success, and therefore bear full responsibility for the results. Their role is to ensure their value stream organizations deliver more value by working more efficiently, smarter, and leaner than the competition.  </p>
			<p>Executives develop and guide strategies, governance policies, and investment decisions. They have a fiduciary (trust) and legal responsibility to oversee these functions. They also develop the mission and vision for the enterprise and guide organizational values. </p>
			<p>In contrast, managers translate strategies, missions, vision, policies, values, and investment decisions into actionable work. Put another way, managers can facilitate and guide the work that tactically implements the strategic plan's goals and objectives. </p>
			<p>At a tactical level, managers review customer orders during monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly meetings to review customer status and complaints, suppliers, and pricing information. Managers evaluate and escalate requests for new investments in facilities, equipment, and tools necessary to meet customer needs. </p>
			<p>Whether or not, as a formalized role of Product Manager or Product Owner, managers also review competitors' offerings and pricing and share that information with all product-team members and other interested stakeholders. LOB managers recognize employees for their efforts, plus they support the implementation of value stream process improvement activities. </p>
			<p>When assisting in VSM efforts, executive managers identify the VSM champion and the initial core team members. The sponsoring executives establish a VSM charter that guides the VSM initiative and chooses a VSM manager to lead the effort. </p>
			<p>If a value stream already exists, the sponsoring executives, VSM team lead, and the value stream managers should already practice <strong class="bold">Gemba</strong> (that is, walking around <em class="italic">the actual place</em> where value stream work occurs), but they must certainly do this once the VSM initiative kicks off. Their goal in Gemba is to break down any communications and hierarchical barriers that hinder cross-functional collaborations. The VSM leads also review any continuous improvement (Kaizen) plans if they exist.</p>
			<p>At the beginning of the VSM initiative, the VSM team leads should create a checklist to ensure their team achieves its objectives. There is nothing wrong with having checklists, as they are simply another form of a <em class="italic">to-do</em> list so that we don't forget things we need to do. However, checklists quickly lose their value if they become directives that force unnecessary work because that's the way things are done and are used as a hammer to bludgeon people for not doing assigned work. </p>
			<p>As an example, the checklist might include the following activities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ensure a VSM charter is developed and approved by executive sponsors </li>
				<li>Develop an initial VSM initiative plan outlining goals, objectives, metrics, and resources</li>
				<li>Plan and facilitate kick-off meetings </li>
				<li>Allocate time and resources for training</li>
				<li>Create incentives for VSM team members and employees that support meeting VSM objectives and goals</li>
				<li>Create a communications plan and maintain diligence in executing and updating the plan</li>
				<li>Monitor team activities against a set of metrics mapped to desired outcomes</li>
				<li>Work with the VSM team to identify and eliminate roadblocks to their Lean initiatives</li>
				<li>Allocate sufficient funding to support the VSM initiative</li>
				<li>Allow flexibility on dates and times but not on driving toward Lean objectives</li>
				<li>Stay involved, participating in kick-off and review meetings, and keep informed</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There is one final note regarding the role of the VSM lead. VSM teams must work together as a collaborative and respectful group and not fear retribution from an overbearing or authoritarian leader. </p>
			<p>As an example, the team members must have the authority to stop work and ask for assistance to resolve any issues that impact the quality of their deliveries. This concept is called <strong class="bold">Andon</strong> in Japanese. The word means <em class="italic">lantern</em>, and the implication is that workers can turn on a light as a signal to stop a production line when they discover a quality issue. Any person, regardless of their rank or position, would be respected for taking this action, with no fear of repercussions.</p>
			<p>As in Agile practices, the VSM leader is a facilitator and a servant leader to the VSM team, helping remove impediments that hinder their work. The VSM team leader also coaches, guides, and otherwise mentors the VSM lead on Lean production processes. </p>
			<p>One of the reasons for integrating Lean-Agile practices in the IT community is because the fundamental ethos (that is, philosophy and culture) is very similar for both, as we can see here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Work as a team </li>
				<li>Respect all team members and stakeholders </li>
				<li>Focus on adding value in terms of the needs of the customer </li>
				<li>Collaborate as a team to immediately solve problems even if it means stopping other work</li>
				<li>Find and address the root cause to prevent problems from recurring</li>
				<li>Eliminate all forms of wasteful activities</li>
				<li>Solve problems iteratively, incrementally, and through experimentation </li>
				<li>Never quit looking for ways to improve </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we know the roles of executive sponsors, managers, and VSM team leads in the VSM initiative, let's move on to look at the VSM team startup requirements. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor173"/>Starting a VSM initiative</h2>
			<p>Before choosing a value stream for a VSM initiative, we must establish the right environment for conducting a productive VSM project. This topic is our learning objective for this section.</p>
			<p>Before selecting a target value stream for Lean improvements, we need to ensure that the target VSM project links back to a corporate strategic plan. We may also require the VSM initiative to support a portfolio investment objective. </p>
			<p>In other words, the VSM team must have a clear understanding of why corporate investment in their project is justified. There is little value in improving value stream activities that do not positively support the organization's mission and strategies. Of course, traditional <strong class="bold">return on investment</strong> (<strong class="bold">ROI</strong>) criteria are equally important when making VSM investment decisions. </p>
			<p>The executives and managers need to make sure that appropriate resources are approved to work on the VSM initiative. Those resources need to be committed to the effort and participate fully in the planning, mapping, and improvement initiatives. </p>
			<p>VSM initiatives share the iterative and incremental aspects of Agile-based development projects. The following diagram shows the eight VSM steps as an iterative and incremental value delivery cycle to represent this concept:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer053" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_6.1.jpg" alt="Figure 6.1 – Eight VSM steps as an iterative and incremental value delivery cycle&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.1 – Eight VSM steps as an iterative and incremental value delivery cycle</p>
			<p>Each complete execution of the eight-step VSM planning, mapping, and improvement cycle is an iteration, with each iteration incrementally providing new value delivery capabilities. </p>
			<p>Note that the VSM team may bounce back and forth between the eight VSM steps, usually to obtain additional information within an iterative VSM cycle. The main goal of having VSM cycles is to ensure continuity of work toward desired Lean value stream improvement activities.</p>
			<p>As with Agile-based concepts, each VSM iteration incrementally adds value to the organization's efforts to implement Lean capabilities. For that reason, the organization's executives must resist the temptation to define and dictate a specific outcome as justification for the VSM effort. The VSM team initiative lives for as long as it's cost-justified to continue investments in their work. </p>
			<p>To ensure the <a id="_idIndexMarker535"/>VSM initiative has long-term sustainability, the executives must dedicate a project manager or a VSM champion, or—in an Agile context—perhaps a Scrum Master to guide the team's efforts. During the VSM effort, the VSM team lead, VSM team members, and the value stream managers must be fully engaged, devoting their time to their value delivery improvement efforts, and be willing to sustain their Lean efforts across the life of the VSM initiative. </p>
			<p>Anything worth doing is worth spending some time on in terms of preparation and planning—not a lot of time, but a couple of weeks might not be out of the question. Initially, organizational executives or their designates must develop a VSM charter. The charter formally approves and funds the initiative. The VSM charter also outlines goals and objectives, as well as the broad scope of work, and identifies the VSM team lead and the high-level metrics and outcomes for success. </p>
			<p>Developing and having the executives sign the VSM charter helps ensure the VSM initiative has one or more executive sponsors supporting and hopefully driving the initiative. The organization's executives must be on board with supporting and leading the effort to get the funding and approvals the VSM team requires to support their identified improvement initiatives.</p>
			<p>Once the VSM charter is approved, the VSM team develops the initial VSM plan. The plan should not be overly unwieldy or overbearing in terms of outlining the work of the team. However, at a minimum, the VSM plan needs to identify the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>VSM team members </li>
				<li>Resources available or needed for training and coaching </li>
				<li>Funding for the VSM team's work and their proposed Kaizen improvements </li>
				<li>The steps applied by the VSM team to guide the organization's Lean improvements, such as the eight steps outlined in this book </li>
				<li>Available VSM software tools </li>
				<li>Guidance on the ongoing team and stakeholder communications </li>
			</ul>
			<p>After a VSM <a id="_idIndexMarker536"/>charter and plan are created and approved, the VSM team lead initiates a kick-off meeting to ensure everyone is on the same page and understands their respective roles and responsibilities. At a minimum, the VSM team lead, all VSM team members, the sponsoring executive (that is, the executive who owns the budget), and critical stakeholders must attend.</p>
			<p>With the VSM kick-off meeting, the VSM initiative is formally in place and ready to start its work. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor174"/>Sustaining the VSM initiative</h2>
			<p>While Lean concepts are<a id="_idIndexMarker537"/> relatively simple to understand, they are challenging to implement and much more challenging to sustain over time. It's human nature to want to move on to something else or begin to let things go. </p>
			<p>VSM has several elements in common with Agile practices—for example, communications and respect for people help ensure difficult information is shared and acted on productively. As with Scrum, Lean practices encourage experimentation and observation (that is, empiricism) and small iterative and incremental steps to improve value, and the VSM teams must be willing to show their findings (<strong class="bold">transparency</strong>), examine their findings (<strong class="bold">inspection</strong>), and be flexible in responding appropriately and aggressively where change is needed (<strong class="bold">adaptive</strong>). </p>
			<p>Most importantly, the executive sponsors and team leaders must remain fully engaged in leading the effort. Folks working within the value stream quickly realize when the leaders are not taking their improvement ideas seriously, and they back off their improvement efforts in frustration. </p>
			<p>Visualization of value stream improvement activities is an essential component of VSM sustainment activities. Again, similar to Agile concepts, VSM employs visual aids with updated team information and metrics to continuously inform executives, managers, and other stakeholders on their work's goals and status. We'll discuss visual aids in more detail in the <em class="italic">Learning about Lean</em> section of this chapter.</p>
			<p>This section concludes the discussions on the need to commit to Lean. Now that you know the importance of committing to Lean, let's look at the tools that help support this objective.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor175"/>Committing to Lean – tools</h2>
			<p>The tools discussed in<a id="_idIndexMarker538"/> this section help us to achieve our objective of committing to Lean. These tools include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>VSM charter</li>
				<li>Kick-off meeting</li>
				<li>VSM storyboard</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each of these tools will be discussed in detail in the next subsections.</p>
			<h3>VSM charter </h3>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">VSM charter</strong> is an <a id="_idIndexMarker539"/>essential tool that helps ensure you have executive commitment. A charter<a id="_idIndexMarker540"/> is a formal commitment by both management and the VSM team members on what they hope to achieve. A VSM charter should cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>VSM initiative title</li>
				<li>VSM charter's mission</li>
				<li>Deliverables</li>
				<li>Expected scope/approach/activities</li>
				<li>Strategic alignment factors</li>
				<li>Timeframe/duration</li>
				<li>Team resources</li>
				<li>Team process</li>
				<li>Expected results</li>
				<li>Key customers and suppliers</li>
				<li>Assumptions</li>
				<li>Risks</li>
				<li>Internal issues</li>
				<li>External issues</li>
			</ul>
			<p><em class="italic">Appendix A</em> includes an <a id="_idIndexMarker541"/>example of a <strong class="bold">VSM charter</strong>.</p>
			<h3>Kick-off meeting</h3>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">kick-off meeting</strong> is an<a id="_idIndexMarker542"/> important meeting to ensure that everyone is prepared to start the VSM initiative and knows their roles and responsibilities. The VSM initiative champion should attend this first meeting to explain why the team was assembled and how they were selected. The VSM champion explains to the VSM team why executive management sponsored and funded the VSM initiative. For example, the VSM project may address competitive pressures, emergent or niche market customer demands, lead-time reductions, improvements to quality, or other concerns over waste.</p>
			<p>Critically, the VSM champion must reinforce the importance to the VSM team members that they take the time to learn the principles and tools of Lean, which we'll address a bit later in this chapter. </p>
			<h3>VSM storyboard</h3>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">VSM storyboard</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker543"/>one of the essential tools presented in this book. It serves as a guide throughout your VSM project, taking you through the eight-step process of planning, mapping, and improving your selected value stream.</p>
			<p>A VSM storyboard includes the following sections: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Date originated</li>
				<li>Identified value stream</li>
				<li>VSM champion</li>
				<li>VSM team members</li>
				<li>Problem categories</li>
				<li>Primary <a id="_idIndexMarker544"/>Lean tools</li>
				<li>Current (as-is) state map</li>
				<li>Future (to-be) state map</li>
				<li>Metrics</li>
				<li>Kaizen proposal/plans </li>
			</ul>
			<p><em class="italic">Appendix B</em> includes a diagram of a <strong class="bold">VSM storyboard template</strong>. Take a few moments to review this diagram, as we revisit <a id="_idIndexMarker545"/>the template frequently in this and other chapters within this book. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">For this initial VSM step, <em class="italic">Committing to Lean</em>, the VSM champion completes <em class="italic">Sections 1</em> and <em class="italic">2</em> of the VSM storyboard, indicating the initial project state, prospective value streams (if identified), the name of the VSM initiative's champion, and the VSM team members. </p>
			<p>With this, we have completed the section on committing to Lean. Now, with the commitment made, it's time to discuss how the VSM team determines the best organizational value stream to support its efforts. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor176"/>Choosing a value stream – VSM Step 2</h2>
			<p>This section deals <a id="_idIndexMarker546"/>with the activities that help a VSM team choose a value stream for its Lean improvement initiative. In the long run, the initial VSM team may go on to assess other value streams. However, it's also likely that larger organizations will initiate multiple VSM teams to support Lean improvement initiatives in other value streams.</p>
			<p>VSM initiatives must have a sense of urgency that justifies investments in resources and time. We already know that organizations typically have numerous value streams and probably don't have the time and resources to work on all of them at once. So, we need to prioritize the team's efforts.</p>
			<p>The question <a id="_idIndexMarker547"/>then becomes: <em class="italic">Which ones should we start improving?</em> In conformance with the <strong class="bold">Pareto principle</strong> (a.k.a. the <strong class="bold">80/ 20 rule</strong> and <strong class="bold">Pareto's Law</strong>), some value stream improvements are more critical to the organization's immediate success than others. The organization's executives may have already identified areas that are inefficient or costly, or not making products customers want, or exhibiting some other aspects of waste, but we still need to do the work to identify our value streams and prioritize areas for improvement. For example, the VSM team can do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Evaluate the degree to which the organization has identified its value streams</li>
				<li>Evaluate the degree to which each value stream maps to customer-oriented value delivery</li>
				<li>Conduct studies to discover which value streams have the highest costs and delays</li>
				<li>Conduct customer surveys to find out how well the organization is meeting their needs</li>
				<li>Use Lean metrics to identify value streams that have the highest levels of waste</li>
				<li>Discuss with employees their observations about value stream issues that need resolution</li>
				<li>If available, conduct<a id="_idIndexMarker548"/> a competitive analysis to determine how well the company is performing in the industry </li>
				<li>Identify critical benchmarks metrics, both inside and outside the company, to see how they compare with others in the company and businesses with similar value streams</li>
				<li>When making VSM investment decisions, employ the <a id="_idIndexMarker549"/>acronym <strong class="bold">SMART</strong>—<strong class="bold">S</strong>pecific, <strong class="bold">M</strong>easurable, <strong class="bold">A</strong>ttainable, <strong class="bold">R</strong>elevant, and <strong class="bold">T</strong>ime-based </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Regardless of the steps taken, the VSM team must always address their work in terms of delivering customer-centric value and doing so in the leanest way possible in both the short and long run. So, to make those kinds of determinations, let's take a moment to revisit the subject of value, but in a VSM context. </p>
			<h3>Defining value in a VSM context</h3>
			<p>This section<a id="_idIndexMarker550"/> revisits the concept of <strong class="bold">value</strong> as it relates to VSM. You already know that, from the perspective of Lean, the term <em class="italic">value</em> implies the delivery of value in the form of a product, service, or result that you are creating for an internal or external customer. Moreover, the concept of value implies the activities are providing results your customers are willing to purchase. </p>
			<p>In reality, our value streams always include elements of waste to one degree or another. Activities that produce results that are irrelevant to your customers' needs are forms of waste, and we need to make our best efforts to eliminate them—and that is the point of <em class="italic">Kaizen</em>, the Japanese term for continuous improvement. </p>
			<p>The term <em class="italic">value</em> in Lean applies to the work we do in our value streams and our VSM activities. But you may have asked yourself what the term <em class="italic">stream</em> implies. It's literally as straightforward as you might think. Metaphorically, the term <em class="italic">stream</em> refers to a sequential flow of activities that create value, therefore VSM improves the flow of value across our organization.</p>
			<p>Conceptually, work <a id="_idIndexMarker551"/>items flow downstream across the value stream activities, just like water flows downstream in a creek or river. Metaphorically, as water in streams and rivers ultimately flows to the oceans, Lean-oriented value flows to our customers. </p>
			<p>Lean practitioners understand that value streams include both value-added and non-value-added work activities. In the long run, we want to eliminate the non-value-added work activities, though it may not be practical to do so in the short run.</p>
			<p>The following diagram provides a graphical display of a generic <strong class="bold">activity workflow model</strong> showing the <a id="_idIndexMarker552"/>cycle times and wait times associated with four activities within a value stream: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer054" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_6.2.jpg" alt="Figure 6.2 – Activity workflow model&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.2 – Activity workflow model</p>
			<p>This model begins to introduce some of the icons used in value stream mapping, but we'll come back and revisit this subject in more detail later in the following chapter on current- and future-state value stream mapping. For now, use the legend to interpret the information contained in the diagram.</p>
			<p>For example, let's say that <a id="_idIndexMarker553"/>our engineers know how to improve <strong class="bold">Activity 2</strong> to bring the cycle time down to 1 hour. At first glance, that seems a reasonable thing to do. However, the problem is that the system's major bottleneck is at <strong class="bold">Activity 4</strong> because it has a significantly greater cycle time of 3.5 hours. Improving the upstream activities' speeds only means more products queue at the entry to <strong class="bold">Activity 4</strong>, and the flow is not improved.</p>
			<p>This example is elementary, as there are other variables to consider when improving flows. We might have setup times that can be improved through better tooling. We may have high levels of defects that cost the organization more than the slow output of <strong class="bold">Activity 4</strong>. So far, our value stream map doesn't say anything about the lot or batch sizes or buffer stock limits, all of which can significantly change the throughput and queuing across each of the identified activities. </p>
			<p>All we know so far is the activity cycle times and the basic flow of materials. However, we can already see that this model does not indicate a Lean value stream. Instead, it's probably much more like the situations you find in organizations that have not yet made the transition to Lean. For example, the arrows indicate the materials are pushed to each downstream activity, and there are buffer stocks between each activity to contain overflow due to the mismatched cycle times.</p>
			<p>Note that the overall wait time is 37 hours against a total lead time of 44.5 hours. In other words, only 7.5 hours of work is included in the overall lead time. The most likely cause is the mismatched cycle times and lot sizes, but we need to analyze the flow across the value stream to confirm the actual cause and effects. </p>
			<p>There is another issue the Lean organization must consider, and that is the integration or touchpoints between value streams. This topic is the subject of the next subsection.</p>
			<h3>Integrating value streams</h3>
			<p>Value stream <a id="_idIndexMarker554"/>interactions occur whenever one value stream adds value in the form of products, services, or information that other value streams need. For example, in the IT community, we often see this when the IT development-oriented value streams produce software products that are then delivered by operations-oriented value streams to internal or external customers. </p>
			<p>We also see value stream interactions occur when product and marketing management value streams conduct activities that help identify customer needs for product design, development, and delivery-oriented value streams. For example, organizations may develop or procure software applications to assist their product and marketing management functions, such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Strategic planning</li>
				<li>Market analysis</li>
				<li>Product planning</li>
				<li>Go-to-market activities</li>
				<li>Sales enablement</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In a digital economy, all<a id="_idIndexMarker555"/> value streams are integrated and supported by IT to enable infrastructure, computing equipment, software, networks, and security components. Many physical products and services have computing, networking, and software components built in as features to enhance the products' capabilities. The value of using digital features is that product updates can be streamed live to the products, enhancing existing products without costly maintenance or service calls.</p>
			<p>But let's simplify things for a moment and get back to the subject of using digital services to support the value <a id="_idIndexMarker556"/>streams associated with product and marketing management. As our <a id="_idIndexMarker557"/>example, <em class="italic">Figure 6.3</em> displays an <strong class="bold">adaptive productizing process</strong> that includes<a id="_idIndexMarker558"/> three <strong class="bold">product management subprocesses</strong>—<strong class="bold">Strategic Planning</strong>, <strong class="bold">Product Planning</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Market Analysis</strong>—and two <strong class="bold">marketing management subprocesses</strong>—<strong class="bold">Go To Market</strong> and <strong class="bold">Sales Enablement</strong>. </p>
			<p>Each of the five subprocesses includes multiple workflows, as indicated by the spokes of the wheel, that deliver value within the adaptive marketing process. Ideally, each workflow is streamlined to deliver value with minimal, if any, waste. In this context, each spoke is a form of value stream. Also, based on the unique needs of every product, and the variety of needs across a product's life cycle, the execution of these processes will vary over the<a id="_idIndexMarker559"/> life of each product. </p>
			<p>The processes are depicted here: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer055" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_6.3.jpg" alt="Figure 6.3 – Product management and marketing management processes&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.3 – Product management and marketing management processes</p>
			<p>Product and <a id="_idIndexMarker560"/>marketing management value streams are operations-oriented—in other words, they do not develop products for our external customers, but they do support our ability to assist and deliver value to our external customers. We'll take a closer look at how operations-oriented value streams function in the next section, using the adaptive productizing process as an example.</p>
			<h3>Operations-oriented value stream integrations</h3>
			<p>By definition, operations-oriented <a id="_idIndexMarker561"/>value streams directly interface with internal or external customers but are not directly involved in product development. Very often, the operations-oriented value streams gather, analyze, and deliver information for their customers. The operations-oriented value streams may also be involved in delivering products and services directly to the organization's customers. </p>
			<p>This subsection introduces operations-oriented value stream activities supporting product management and marketing management functions, and we are going to use the Adaptive Productizing Process as our example.</p>
			<p>An adaptive productizing process is a customer-centric approach that helps an organization track and respond to customer demands. Adaptive product and marketing management approaches evolved to support emergent business models such as <strong class="bold">Software as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>), new <a id="_idIndexMarker562"/>promotional and sales routes to <a id="_idIndexMarker563"/>markets through Web 2.0, and selling to customers via <strong class="bold">business-to-business</strong> (<strong class="bold">B2B</strong>) and <strong class="bold">business-to-consumer</strong> (<strong class="bold">B2C</strong>) industry <a id="_idIndexMarker564"/>segments. </p>
			<p>A vital element of the adaptive productizing process is the utilization of social media-based marketing. As a result, the adaptive productizing process is well suited to work within our digital economies. </p>
			<p>Adaptive marketing processes take advantage of digital enablement to support the organization's value chain—in other words, product and marketing management value streams have evolved to support what we develop and how we sell and deliver products in our modern digital economy. The product and marketing management subprocesses add value in the form of market and customer information to determine product requirements from a customer-centric perspective.  </p>
			<p><em class="italic">Figure 6.3</em> graphically depicted the adaptive productizing<a id="_idIndexMarker565"/> process as a <strong class="bold">hub-and-spoke</strong> process model—in other words, work artifacts and information moving across the adaptive productizing processes can flow in any direction. Therefore, when we design our product management and marketing management value streams, and associated information systems, we need to take these concerns into account.</p>
			<p>Using an IT analogy, we need a value stream integration approach that mimics the work performed by a hub-and-spoke message broker to simplify communications, data flows, and asynchronous transformations. Unfortunately, a point-to-point process and information integration strategy won't work, as there are too many points of integration. Plus, there is no way the development team can account for every possible information flow or activity interaction across the adaptive productizing process. </p>
			<p>A better approach is<a id="_idIndexMarker566"/> to assess each set of activities within each spoke as potential elements of the overall value stream. Each spoke of the hub represents a standalone activity or subprocess. Moreover, each subprocess can be invoked by other subprocesses as the need arises. For each product or product family, evaluate the overall product management and product marketing value streams to identify where the flow constraints form bottlenecks and where waste hinders the overall process. </p>
			<p>The hub-and-spoke analogy is not meant to imply that work is pushed from one marketing value stream to another in the adaptive productizing process. In Lean-oriented production processes, work is always pulled on demand when it's needed by the upstream customer or succeeding activity. </p>
			<p>Still, the hub-and-spoke analogy is useful because the flow of work through the identified adaptive product management and product marketing tasks is highly dependent upon each product's needs across their life cycles. </p>
			<p>Taking the <strong class="bold">Go To Market</strong> processes as an example, <strong class="bold">Product Positioning</strong>, <strong class="bold">Routes to Market</strong>, and other associated subprocesses are potential value stream workflow components. Each workflow component potentially includes multiple activities and techniques. The component subprocesses have different cycle times and wait times. They all likely have a mix of value-adding and non-value-adding activities and other forms of waste that should be cleaned up over time. </p>
			<p>Always prioritize improvement activities to eliminate the current constraint in the overall value stream process. If you have time and resources to work on more than one value stream improvement initiative, always make sure you place your priorities on resolving the leading flow constraints or highest-cost drivers. Later in this chapter, you learn how to use current (<em class="italic">as-is</em>) and future (<em class="italic">to-be</em>) value stream maps to help you make these assessments. </p>
			<p>The adaptive productizing value streams represent a more complex view of the product and marketing-oriented value streams than those identified initially and outlined by James Martin. Nevertheless, the many subprocesses depicted in <em class="italic">Figure 6.3</em> are no less relevant. The diagram also does a better job of showing the complexity of activities and the potential for interactions across product and marketing management value streams. With this analogy, you <a id="_idIndexMarker567"/>should gain insights into why VSM and DevOps are critical enablers to improve Lean value streams across the organization.  </p>
			<h3>Development-oriented value stream integration</h3>
			<p>Conceptually, a development-oriented value<a id="_idIndexMarker568"/> stream includes all the value-added and non-value-added actions necessary to produce a product or service, from the initial concept through development to receipt of the payment. Development-oriented value streams produce products for external customers or to support the organization's operations-oriented value streams.</p>
			<p>In manufacturing, each product family follows a separate value stream. Product families typically group parts or part numbers that share a similar process sequence. The overall objective is always to make sure the right parts and materials arrive just in time, as they are needed to support the development process, and at the right location.  </p>
			<p>Conceptually, this means information related to a product order must flow across all upstream development-oriented value stream activities to match parts with products and their associated development activities. The parts and materials must arrive in the proper sequence at the buffer stores to their specific production activities to support the customer order. The customer order information flows back to the inventory management system to trigger new parts and materials replacement orders to supply-chain partners. </p>
			<p>And each product area has three primary value streams that overlap and flow together, as identified here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A <strong class="bold">concept-to-launch</strong> value <a id="_idIndexMarker569"/>stream—Includes all the activities required to take a concept or idea through product design and engineering, determine competitive pricing, establish a supply chain and processes for the procurement of materials, design customer ordering and quoting activities, and determine the<a id="_idTextAnchor177"/> control plan release process</li>
				<li>A <strong class="bold">raw-material-to-finished-product</strong> value stream—Contains all the manufacturing materials and <a id="_idIndexMarker570"/>information activities to deliver a product to a customer with the highest possible quality at the lowest possible cost, with the shortest possible lead time</li>
				<li>An <strong class="bold">order-to-cash</strong> value stream—Begins<a id="_idIndexMarker571"/> with an incoming customer order and ends with a payment receipt </li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong class="bold">Concept to launch</strong> and <strong class="bold">order to cash</strong> are <a id="_idIndexMarker572"/>operations-oriented value streams, while <strong class="bold">raw materials to finished products</strong> is a development value stream. The naming convention <a id="_idIndexMarker573"/>for the three aforementioned development-oriented value streams follows the strategy identified <a id="_idIndexMarker574"/>previously to specify the name's start and ending activities. You don't have to name your value streams in this manner, but this approach makes it easier to conceptualize the work performed within each value stream and the deliverables. </p>
			<p>Just as described for <a id="_idIndexMarker575"/>operations-oriented value streams, development-oriented value streams have multiple processes and activities. The activities vary across industries and companies, therefore an essential element of VSM is to define those activities that give you a better competitive advantage. </p>
			<p>This issue bears repeating: never attempt to improve individual processes without having a complete picture of the value stream. Without a map of the current value stream, you cannot know where your bottlenecks and wastes are. Improving an individual process may have little or no effect if it's not the main bottleneck, and there is always only one main bottleneck at any given point in time. </p>
			<p>Following the Pareto principle (that is, the 80/20 rule), once you fix the current main bottleneck, other activity cycle times pop up as relatively lengthy in the value stream, creating new bottlenecks. The same principle is true for resolving any form of waste across your value streams. It's the primary reason we must always practice Kaizen (that is, continuously improving our working practices to eliminate the next-highest constraints and other forms of waste). </p>
			<p>In their book, <em class="italic">VSM for the Lean Office</em>, Dan Tapping and Don Shuker note that between 60% and 80% of all product development costs are non-production costs. In other words, the highest costs <a id="_idIndexMarker576"/>accumulate from the <strong class="bold">concept-to-launch</strong> and <strong class="bold">order-to-cash</strong> value streams. Since these are primarily information-driven value streams, VSM and<a id="_idIndexMarker577"/> DevOps are critical enablers to all Lean implementation activities (Tapping, Shuker; 2002, 2003).</p>
			<p>Before we end this subsection, let's take a quick look at the tools that help identify which value streams have the highest opportunity to improve our value delivery capabilities. </p>
			<h3>Choosing a value stream – tools</h3>
			<p>At the start of every <a id="_idIndexMarker578"/>VSM initiative, the VSM team members should conduct four activities to help them choose the appropriate value stream for their next initiative. These activities include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Identifying immediate customer needs and concerns that aren't adequately addressed</li>
				<li>Performing a work-unit routing analysis</li>
				<li>Prioritizing targeted value streams in terms of the most significant net positive impact</li>
				<li>Updating the team charter and continuing brainstorming ideas</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The primary tools available <a id="_idIndexMarker579"/>to the VSM team to assist with these four activities include a <strong class="bold">product-quantity</strong> (<strong class="bold">PQ</strong>) analysis, a <strong class="bold">product-routing</strong> (<strong class="bold">PR</strong>) analysis, a work unit <a id="_idIndexMarker580"/>routing analysis, plus updates to the <a id="_idIndexMarker581"/>VSM storyboard. These are outlined in more detail here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">PQ analysis</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker582"/> involves creating a Pareto chart containing the list of parts or work items produced over the previous 6 months. Each line item includes the part numbers, quantities produced, cumulative quantities, percent of production, and cumulative percent of production. This analysis helps the VSM team quickly see which product lines contribute to and have the highest impact on improving production volumes.  </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">PR analysis</strong>: If <a id="_idIndexMarker583"/>PQ analysis has a PQ ratio of 40:60 or greater (40% or more of products account for 60% of the total quantity of parts), use PR analysis to help choose your value stream. In other words, we want to form product families around the highest volume of products that have a similar set of value stream activities.  <p>Using a matrix or table format, list the products and their volumes in the first columns, and then list their product activity sequence horizontally. Next, group products with the same process sequences and analyze the mix of process routes. Your analysis should include evaluations of the highest-volume products, highest-cost products, most inefficient flows, and current and future customer demands. See the following <a id="_idIndexMarker584"/>screenshot for an example of this: </p></li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer056" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_6.4.jpg" alt="Figure 6.4 – PR analysis table&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.4 – PR analysis table</p>
			<p>In this example, the product team creates a PR table and can quickly see that the highest-volume products <strong class="bold">1</strong>-<strong class="bold">3</strong> all have activities <strong class="bold">C</strong>, <strong class="bold">E</strong>, and <strong class="bold">G</strong>. Also, products <strong class="bold">1</strong> and <strong class="bold">3</strong> both have a requirement for activities <strong class="bold">A</strong> and <strong class="bold">F</strong>. Thus, it probably makes sense to create a value stream with activities <strong class="bold">A</strong> through <strong class="bold">C</strong> and <strong class="bold">E</strong> through <strong class="bold">G</strong> as dedicated workstations. However, only product <strong class="bold">C</strong> in the list of the highest-volume products has a requirement for activity <strong class="bold">D</strong>. Further analysis is required to see whether adding activity <strong class="bold">D</strong> is cost-justified to add as a dedicated workstation to the value stream flow.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Work unit routing analysis</strong>: This is the<a id="_idIndexMarker585"/> services-oriented equivalent to PR analysis, but instead of listing product lines in the matrix, you list families of work units or customers involved in the area you are targeting for improvements. <p>The following screenshot shows an example of a work unit routing analysis in a worksheet format:</p></li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer057" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_6.5.jpg" alt="Figure 6.5 – Work unit routing analysis&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.5 – Work unit routing analysis</p>
			<p>The first column lists the work-item types produced for customers, while the second column lists the average volume of work performed for each identified work item or customer over time. The next set of columns lists across the matrix the sequence of processes or activities supporting the work items in production across the matrix. In the grid formed in the matrix, mark the activities or processes required to produce each product type. Finally, group work units with similar process flows and then rank all the flows according to their volumes. </p>
			<p>Our example shows that <a id="_idIndexMarker586"/>work item types <strong class="bold">1</strong>, <strong class="bold">5</strong>, and <strong class="bold">6</strong> have similar workflows, with a combined volume of 1,000 work items. We'll call this <em class="italic">Group A</em>. Also, work items <strong class="bold">1</strong> and <strong class="bold">4</strong> have identical flows for a total volume of 225 work items, which we'll refer to as <em class="italic">Group B</em>. Work-item number <strong class="bold">3</strong> stands alone, with a mere <strong class="bold">25</strong> units required.</p>
			<p>It should be pretty clear that <em class="italic">Group A</em> represents the most significant amount of work for the company, followed distantly by <em class="italic">Group B</em>. The production requirement for work-item number <strong class="bold">3</strong> is comparatively minimal and probably doesn't bear much analysis unless it's exceptionally profitable or causing bottleneck issues for the other product lines. </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Updated VSM storyboard</strong>: You should <a id="_idIndexMarker587"/>now have a definitive idea of which value stream(s) your VSM team plans to focus on for its Lean-oriented improvement activities. Update the VSM storyboard to reflect the identified value stream(s) in <em class="italic">Section 2</em>. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>So far, you have learned the <a id="_idIndexMarker588"/>first two steps of the eight-step VSM process for planning, mapping, and sustaining Lean improvements. <em class="italic">Step 1</em> included the activities to identify and initiate the core VSM implementation team. Next, the activities in <em class="italic">Step 2</em> helped identify the highest-priority value stream for their VSM initiative. Now, it's time to examine <em class="italic">Step 3</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor178"/>Learning about Lean – VSM Step 3</h2>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Step 3</em>, the VSM<a id="_idIndexMarker589"/> team must make sure they have a strong understanding of Lean concepts, and they must make sure that the team members working in the value stream understand the concepts of Lean production. </p>
			<p>There are many sources available to learn about Lean production practices. This section serves as a quick primer for those who are just starting their Lean learning journey. What's most important is that the VSM team members learn the basic concepts of Lean and then apply them. It's the application of Lean principles that helps build the skills for all future VSM initiatives. </p>
			<h3>Developing a learning plan</h3>
			<p>To ensure all team members develop sufficient skills and understanding of Lean concepts, the VSM team should <a id="_idIndexMarker590"/>start their learning initiative by building a <strong class="bold">Lean learning plan</strong>. Developing a training plan typically includes the following six steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Document required skills and knowledge.</li>
				<li>Perform current skills and knowledge assessment. </li>
				<li>Conduct skills and knowledge gap assessment.</li>
				<li>Design training methods (that is, instructor-led classroom training, interactive group sessions, hands-on training, computer-based and e-learning training, video training, coaching, and mentoring).</li>
				<li>Schedule and<a id="_idIndexMarker591"/> conduct the training.</li>
				<li>Evaluate the effectiveness of the training and make the necessary adjustments.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Benchmarking</h3>
			<p>Suppose this is your<a id="_idIndexMarker592"/> team's first VSM initiative. In that case, they may not understand what looks good yet in terms of best practices and metrics for installing Lean production capabilities across their industry. In such cases, it's often useful to spend some time gathering information from similar enterprises or departments to develop a set of benchmarks for comparative analysis. This type of activity is <a id="_idIndexMarker593"/>called <strong class="bold">benchmarking</strong> and typically involves analyzing competitive practices using quality, time, and cost metrics.</p>
			<p>The VSM team should start the benchmarking activity by being very clear on what they want to improve. Frankly, the team should be doing this from the start, as that's the whole point of the VSM initiative. As the team reaches out to potential benchmarking organizations, they need to understand this is a big ask, and they must be humble about it.</p>
			<p>You're not likely to get your competitors to share this information, so the team's first order of business is to identify organizations and industries similar to the type of work performed in the VSM team's value stream. </p>
			<p>As the VSM team reaches out to their targeted benchmarking partners, they should take the time first to understand their partner's business. You'll have a hard time convincing a potential partner to spend their time with you if you haven't taken the time to know anything about them. Besides, it's essential to let them know that your objective is to create a relationship where both parties win from sharing information—not just in the short run, but potentially over time. In that way, both organizations can continue to evolve and improve together, plus the benchmarking partner is not likely to feel they are being used. </p>
			<p>Once you know what your goals of the VSM initiative are, use that information to develop a set of questions to ask your benchmarking partner. This work should be done in advance of meeting with them or even contacting them. Again, this type of preliminary activity will show them you've done your homework, and then you bring something to the partnership. </p>
			<p>When you meet with the<a id="_idIndexMarker594"/> benchmarking partners, have more than one person from your VSM team in attendance. You don't need to overwhelm your partners by taking the entire VSM team, but you need at least two people to go to the meeting—one to take notes, and the other to ask questions. </p>
			<p>The questions you might ask can be imposing in terms of encroaching on confidential and proprietary information. Therefore, you need to be sensitive to their concerns and respect their privacy.</p>
			<p>Having a face-to-face meeting is almost always best for seeing people's reactions and responding appropriately to their concerns. Your partners might even be willing to show your team<a id="_idIndexMarker595"/> examples of their activities while you are visiting their site. However, especially in this day and age of COVID-19, online conference calls are certainly workable and appropriate. </p>
			<p>After finishing the meeting, thank your benchmarking partner for their time and consideration, and make sure you follow up with the promised sharing of information. Specifically, you should share the outcomes of the VSM practices you put in place within your value stream. </p>
			<p>The purpose of a benchmarking exercise is to have a set of metrics and procedures that you can compare to your own. Suppose you have chosen your benchmarking partners because they have demonstrated superior competencies in the areas you are measuring. In that case, you will have a sound baseline to gauge your current state and to define expectations for your desired future states. </p>
			<p>With the Lean training plan in place, the VSM team needs to ensure all participants and active stakeholders take advantage of the training. Specifically, there are six areas of Lean they must understand. We'll discuss these six fundamental concepts in the next subsection.</p>
			<h3>Learning the fundamental concepts of Lean</h3>
			<p>There are six fundamental concepts that you need to understand to create a Lean system. These six concepts include the following:</p>
			<ul>

			</ul>
			<p>We'll briefly review each of these six Lean concepts, in turn, in the next subsections.</p>
			<h4>The cost reduction principle </h4>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">cost reduction principle</strong> in <a id="_idIndexMarker596"/>Lean is oppositional to mainstream pricing practices <a id="_idIndexMarker597"/>where we calculate the price of a product by adding up costs and then applying desired profit margins. The problem with this strategy is that the focus is neither on the customer nor on how to improve. Without understanding how our customers assess value, we can't know what price they are willing to pay. Moreover, if we don't focus on optimizing value delivery and price this accordingly, we open ourselves to losing business to our competitors.</p>
			<p>Instead, the Lean organization allows the customer to set the selling price, and the costs and profits become variables. In other words, the Lean organization analyzes to determine an acceptable price and then evaluates what must be done across the value stream to eliminate waste, such that they can deliver the product and service at an acceptable price. </p>
			<h4>The seven deadly wastes </h4>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">seven Lean wastes</strong> add <a id="_idIndexMarker598"/>cost and time delays or hinder quality without <a id="_idIndexMarker599"/>adding value to the customers. The seven wastes of Lean include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Overproducing</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker600"/>occurs whenever we produce too much of something without a customer order or historical demand for external customers to justify the investments in time and resources or before the work items are required by our internal customers.<p>Overproducing<a id="_idIndexMarker601"/> also occurs when we acquire or develop batch processes or high-speed equipment mismatched with the rate of flow across other value stream activities. Recalling the ideal of single-piece flows, we already know that batch processing causes queues to form and creates excessive inventories. Additionally, spending money, time, and resources to expedite one activity may cause wait times, bottlenecks, and queues to form across the value stream. </p><p>Recalling the <strong class="bold">80/20 rule</strong> (<strong class="bold">the Pareto principle</strong> or <strong class="bold">Pareto's Law</strong>) always improves performance on the top 20% of your efficiency problems, as this probably represents 80% to 90% of your current waste and inefficiencies. By fixing your current bottlenecks, you improve flow and capacity across the value stream as a whole.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Waiting</strong> (<strong class="bold">Q time</strong>): This is <a id="_idIndexMarker602"/>when anything—including people, materials, equipment, or information—spends time waiting without value-added work performed. The waste comes from hidden bugs and defects, inventory carrying costs, and extra storage facilities.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Transport</strong>: Includes <a id="_idIndexMarker603"/>having to move something further than necessary to perform the next activity, representing a waste of time and energy. Transport applies to materials, people, and paper-based information flows. <p>Transport-related waste often forms before moving to Lean, when value stream activities are located within or across disparate facilities by function or by department, or given to external suppliers, and do not support an efficient flow for a given product line. </p><p>Transport as waste also<a id="_idIndexMarker604"/> occurs when items are temporally filed, stocked, stacked, or otherwise moved out of the way. </p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Overprocessing</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker605"/> occurs when we load a product with features and functions customers haven't requested. They may not be valued, and we shouldn't develop or deliver any product capability until<a id="_idIndexMarker606"/> we know there is a customer need to justify the work. Furthermore, we won't know this until the product managers or product owners conduct business opportunity assessments to know if there is a cost-justified market for the enhancements.<p>Overprocessing<a id="_idIndexMarker607"/> is a critical form of waste as we can't get our time and resources back, and we have to eat the costs of something our customers don't value. Even if a market is identified, the features or functions may not have the highest priority, and they may not be cost-justified. Our customers may not want to pay the price that it takes to justify the costs of development and delivery. </p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inventory</strong>: This is an <a id="_idIndexMarker608"/>excess stock of any materials or products, or even resources, that are not immediately needed. We only need enough materials to balance<a id="_idIndexMarker609"/> flows, and no more.<p>Remember that the ideal is single-piece flows with equivalent cycle times across all value stream activities and no changeover times. If we can obtain that ideal, including material deliveries under JIT, there is no justification for inventories. </p><p>In the meantime, inventories take up space, may impact safety, can expire in specific circumstances, or hide bugs and defects in inventoried lots. Inventories are also expensive to purchase and store, and worse—they may not be what you require when you<a id="_idIndexMarker610"/> finally match the inventoried materials to customer orders (that is, wrong part number, model, or type).</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Motion</strong>: This includes any <a id="_idIndexMarker611"/>movement not necessary to complete an operation. Motion <a id="_idIndexMarker612"/>is a form of waste that results from ineffective job processes or facility layouts and often causes more walking, reaching, or bending than necessary. In the context of digital enablement, this can be seen as excessive process overhead and lag, or built-in push-type systems and workflows.<p>This form of waste is similar to transport but on a smaller scale. Think of transport as movement across facilities or geographies, while motion is limited to the range of movement within or across linked value stream activities. </p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Defects</strong>: This is a hidden<a id="_idIndexMarker613"/> form of waste from defective work in physical <a id="_idIndexMarker614"/>products or bugs in software development. Although sometimes used interchangeably, the word <em class="italic">defect</em> in software<a id="_idIndexMarker615"/> development refers to situations where a product enhancement is missing a customer-requested feature. In contrast, bugs are defects in the software's code. <p>Defects usually require rework or destruction of materials and products. In either case, defects are quite costly. </p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Though not included as part of the original seven deadly sins of waste, some Lean thought leaders describe another form of waste <a id="_idIndexMarker616"/>identified as <strong class="bold">non-utilized talents</strong>. Human beings have both intellectual and physical attributes that add value to an organization. In particular, our employees' intellectual attributes can grow by their gaining relevant experience, knowledge, and skills. </p>
			<p>Suppose we don't initiate programs to improve our employees' intellectual potentials. In that case, we allow waste to form by limiting human capital growth and the innovations our people can bring to the workplace. Human capital is an economic view of our employees' contributions and evaluates their skills, knowledge, and experience as contributing both value and costs to our organization.</p>
			<p>One final note to make in this section is that all forms of waste within our value stream are included in the product's overall cost, and therefore its price. This Lean concept is essential, as eliminating waste represents opportunities to improve our value streams to deliver customer-centric value. In this case, waste occurs because we are not taking advantage of unutilized human talent.</p>
			<p>This section concludes our discussions on the elimination of waste. Let's now move on to understand the importance of the two Lean pillars behind the TPS: JIT and Jidoka.</p>
			<h4>Two pillars of TPS</h4>
			<p>Recall our earlier discussions on the TPS. In his books, Ohno claims TPS is based on two primary concepts, or pillars: <strong class="bold">JIT </strong>and <strong class="bold">Jidoka</strong> (which translates as autonomation). </p>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker617"/> TPS aims to make vehicles ordered by customers as fast and efficiently as possible and deliver value as quickly as possible. Let's take a quick look at how JIT and Jidoka contribute to those goals, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">JIT production</strong>: This is an<a id="_idIndexMarker618"/> ideal state of continuous flow where materials reach their correct point of assembly, in the proper order, and just at the time of need. When a customer order comes in, signals propagate along the production line, or value stream, to indicate the new material requirements at each production stage. Under a <strong class="bold">first-in, first-out</strong> (<strong class="bold">FIFO</strong>) order entry system, the orders and materials utilized within the value stream trickle forward to meet up with the right product, at the right stage of production, at the right time. <p>In other words, JIT systems replenish parts in a pull-based system driven by customer orders. The ideal scenario is to refine your Lean processes and value stream activities to enable a single-piece flow to replenish materials at the point and time of need. For example, JIT triggers third-party suppliers' parts and material deliveries upstream in a manufacturing line upon receiving a customer order upstream. In an IT-oriented value stream, we implement the same concepts via Kanban boards and cards. </p><p>JIT is the heartbeat of Lean production systems, establishing its pulse to ensure the correct pacing in delivering information, materials, and parts when and where they are needed. </p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Jidoka</strong> (a.k.a. <strong class="bold">autonomation</strong>)—This <a id="_idIndexMarker619"/>uses automation to perform repetitive and dangerous tasks. The goal is not to use automation to replace humans. Instead, the autonomation capabilities help free up workers' time to perform multiple tasks within their value streams that require flexibility and thought. <p>To accomplish this goal, we must distinguish between work that needs human guidance from work that is repetitive, hazardous, or subject to human error, and therefore best performed by automated machinery. Autonomation includes developing defect detection and prevention devices and automation capabilities for all assembly and testing processes. </p><p>Note that Jidoka applies equally to automating tasks such as testing, configuration, and provisioning in a software development context. In other words, the automation capabilities employed in CI, test automation, and CD allow the developers to stay focused on their value-adding tasks associated with requirements analysis, architecture and design, coding, and problem-solving. </p><p>The goal of Jidoka is to make workplaces efficient and safe while minimizing the possibility of delivering low-quality or defective products. Ultimately, Jidoka helps mistake-proof your value streams while providing efficiencies and throughput to deliver products at a rate that matches your customers' demands (that is, Takt time). </p><p>There are four basic concepts associated with Jidoka, outlined as follows: </p><p>a) Simplify or automate the discovery of abnormalities </p><p>b) Immediately stop all failed or failing activities, even if it means shutting down the entire value stream, as we don't want queues to form</p><p>c) Fix the problem before restarting the line</p><p>d) Investigate and solve the root causes of the problem</p><p>These four processes ensure that problems are discovered and addressed quickly. Moreover, the objective of <a id="_idIndexMarker620"/>Jidoka is to prevent problems from getting out of hand by producing more waste. Ultimately, we need to find out the root causes so that we can prevent future mishaps. </p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we've discussed the concepts behind JIT and Jidoka, let's discuss the 5S system, a Lean production tool that helps improve workplace efficiency by eliminating waste.</p>
			<h4>The 5S system </h4>
			<p>As with the two <a id="_idIndexMarker621"/>pillars of Lean discussed in the previous section, the <strong class="bold">5S system</strong> was developed in <a id="_idIndexMarker622"/>Japan as part of the TPS manufacturing method. When first starting out on a Lean improvement initiative, it's not unusual to find that value stream processes are misaligned, cluttered, and inefficient, if they exist at all. </p>
			<p>This situation often occurs in manufacturing lines that produce multiple product lines and in operations-oriented value streams with unorganized paper-based systems, files, supplies, tools, equipment, and books. The primary intent of the 5S system is to eliminate the clutter and improve the flow of our value stream activities in a structured approach. </p>
			<p>The origin of the <em class="italic">5S</em> term came from the Japanese words <em class="italic">Seiri</em>, <em class="italic">Seiton</em>, <em class="italic">Seiso</em>, <em class="italic">Seiketsu</em>, and <em class="italic">Shitsuke</em>. Conveniently, we have five English terms that also start with the letter <em class="italic">S</em> to stand in for the originals. The 5S system includes, as you might imagine, five steps, each starting with the letter <em class="italic">S</em>, as shown in the following screenshot: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer058" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.6 – The 5S system</p>
			<p>Each of the five<a id="_idIndexMarker623"/> letters indicates a step in a process to improve and sustain our Lean <a id="_idIndexMarker624"/>practices. So, let's take a few moments to review the work associated with each step, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Sort</strong>—<em class="italic">Seiri</em> (tidiness): Start by reviewing all inventories of materials and parts, equipment, files, documents, books, or any other paraphernalia and get rid of anything no longer needed in the revised or new value stream.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Set in order</strong>—<em class="italic">Seiton</em> (orderliness): Organize whatever remains to support efficient workflow, including identifying and storing inventory and buffer stock storage areas. Arrange all necessary items to make them easy and efficient to access. Most importantly, strive to maintain orderliness going forward. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Shine</strong>—<em class="italic">Seiso</em> (cleanliness): As part of the first two steps, take the time to clean the areas and inspect equipment to make sure everything works properly. Clean and inspect each work area regularly. The process of regular cleaning helps ensure that your work area and equipment are adequately maintained, reducing the potential for creating waste or unanticipated work stoppages. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Standardize</strong>—<em class="italic">Seiketsu</em> (standardization): The goal here is to standardize activities to maintain the work environment across your value stream—in other words, create a 5S standard operating procedure to maintain orderliness, cleanliness, and maintenance of your work environment. Make your 5S standards visual and evident within the work area. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Sustain</strong>—<em class="italic">Shitsuke</em> (discipline): Maintenance of the 5S standards does not happen accidentally. It takes constant attention to detail and discipline to ensure the value stream team stays on top of their tasks. Value stream champions or leaders must assign responsibilities, track their progress, and continue the cycle. They are also responsible for educating and informing team members on the 5S processes and standards to ensure continued compliance. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>The concepts behind the<a id="_idIndexMarker625"/> 5S system are quite simple to understand but challenging<a id="_idIndexMarker626"/> to implement and maintain. Due diligence and constant attention must be built into the value streams we are working for. The payoff is worth eliminating waste and keeping waste from coming back into the value stream system. </p>
			<p>Since we have already introduced the notion of making your implemented 5S system and standards visual to help maintain the discipline, let's move on to talk about how visual aids improve other aspects of VSM.</p>
			<h4>Visual workplace</h4>
			<p>If you are an agile<a id="_idIndexMarker627"/> practitioner, you will already be very aware of the importance of creating <a id="_idIndexMarker628"/>visual aids within the workplace environment to provide relevant and timely information on your team's work. These visual <a id="_idIndexMarker629"/>aids take the<a id="_idIndexMarker630"/> form of <strong class="bold">big visible charts  </strong>(<strong class="bold">BVCs</strong>) and <strong class="bold">information radiators</strong>. Though the concept of having large visual displays originated within the TPS, it was IT innovators Kent Beck and Alistair Cockburn who made the practice of using visual aids widespread within the IT community of Agile practitioners. </p>
			<p>Kent Beck coined the term <em class="italic">BVC</em> in his book <em class="italic">Extreme Programming Explained</em> (1999), while Alistair Cockburn coined the term <em class="italic">information radiator</em> in his book <em class="italic">Agile Software Development</em> (2001). <em class="italic">Information radiator</em> is a generic term for any handwritten, drawn, printed, or electronic displays placed by an Agile or Lean-Agile team in readily visible locations, usually within their co-located work areas.</p>
			<p>Having large <a id="_idIndexMarker631"/>visual displays aims to make it easy for all product team members, managers, and other stakeholders to quickly find and review updated information on product backlogs and work items under development. Regarding the visualization of production data, recall the old adage: <em class="italic">A picture paints a thousand words</em>. The <a id="_idIndexMarker632"/>information radiators can include Kanban boards, burndown charts, burnup charts, status and counts of automated tests, incident reports, CI status, and any other information relevant to understanding the product team's goals, progress, and priorities.</p>
			<p>Now, let's move on to discuss the three phases of Lean application, including the concepts of demand, flow, and leveling.</p>
			<h4>Three stages of Lean application – demand, flow, and leveling</h4>
			<p>It's tempting to<a id="_idIndexMarker633"/> want to implement Lean practices across the value stream all at once, but that's likely not to work out too well. It's better to break up the analysis and implementation into three phases that focus initially on customer demand, followed by continuous flow, and—finally—leveling. </p>
			<p>The phases should also occur in this order: demand, continuous flow, and <a id="_idIndexMarker634"/>leveling. We'll see how this works in the <a id="_idIndexMarker635"/>next chapter on value stream mapping, and in <a id="_idIndexMarker636"/>particular, mapping the future state. But before we get to that topic, let's take a look at the activities occurring in these phases, as follows: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Customer demand phase</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker637"/> includes a set of activities to determine who our customers are and their requirements. The tools used in this phase include Takt time calculation, pitch calculation, buffer and safety resources, 5S for the office, and problem-solving methods. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Continuous flow phase</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker638"/> includes a set of activities to help establish continuous flow across your value stream to ensure the correct units arrive at the right time in the required amounts to support your customers' orders, both internal and external. The tools used in this phase include in-process supermarkets, Kanban systems, FIFO line balancing, standardized work, and work area design. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Leveling phase</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker639"/>includes activities to distribute work evenly and effectively across the value stream. This phase's tools include a visible pitch board, a load-leveling (heijunka) box, and a runner system. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>The preceding descriptions should make it evident that each future state mapping phase includes a unique set of activities and tools. As mentioned previously, there is also an implied flow to the future state mapping work. We need to understand how customer demand impacts our value stream before improving the flow of work, and we need to improve flow before we can level the load of work as new customer orders come into our value stream system.</p>
			<p>The guidelines for implementing the eight VSM steps provide a solid foundation for implementing Lean practices across your targeted value stream and sustaining and improving your Lean improvements. Still, it's also essential to learn how to implement the demand, flow, and leveling phases of Lean practices to achieve your desired future state goals.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the three phases of Lean application: demand, flow, and leveling, along with the tools of each phase and the sequence of the phases:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer059" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.7 – Three phases of Lean application: demand, flow, and leveling</p>
			<p>Executive managers cannot mandate the implementation of Lean practices—it's an all-hands activity involving all team members supporting the VSM activities, plus the employees who work within the value stream. The involvement of employees is the topic of the following subsection. </p>
			<h4>Total employee involvement </h4>
			<p>Employees are encouraged<a id="_idIndexMarker640"/> to make positive contributions to improving their work areas through continuous improvement activities, otherwise known <a id="_idIndexMarker641"/>as <strong class="bold">Kaizen</strong>. Note that in Lean, Kaizen events are synonymous with the concepts behind Agile retrospectives. In both cases, the product team sets aside time to assess what's working and not working so well. The objective is to explore ways to improve the things that aren't working well.</p>
			<p>The term <em class="italic">Kaizen</em> comes from the Japanese conjunctions of <em class="italic">Kai</em> (to take apart) and <em class="italic">Zen</em> (to make good). So, we want to take apart the problem, explore the cause and effects, and then figure out how to change what we do to eliminate our problems' root causes. </p>
			<p>The outcome of a Kaizen event or an Agile retrospective is to build an action plan of immediate activities the team can take to improve their performance. In Kaizen and retrospective processes, the focus must be on improving the work and not blaming people. The latter approach only causes finger-pointing and disfunction among the team members. As with any system, a team is much greater than the sum of its parts, but a dysfunctional team no longer operates like a well-oiled machine.</p>
			<p>Every team member must share a vision for the work in front of them and view the value stream as a whole. If one part of a value stream breaks down, the value stream as a functional system breaks down. When this happens, all hands need to share ideas, encourage feedback, and obtain buy-in to identify strategies to address the problems. </p>
			<p>Know that those <a id="_idIndexMarker642"/>good ideas come from all organizational areas, including managers, stakeholders, and employees. Therefore, all ideas require careful consideration, regardless of the source. Everyone needs to feel that they have ownership in the outcome and are encouraged to improve the flow of materials and information across a value stream and eliminate costly waste. </p>
			<p>A good friend of mine, and technical reviewer of this book, Enrique Gomez, offered this story about how he was taught, during his Six Sigma training, that Kaizen events can be quite aggressive. The example he was given allegedly occurred at a Japanese manufacturing plant. The production at a specific workstation suffered from a disorganized execution of the production tasks. However, rather than iteratively improve the station, the managers took the tools and threw them all on the floor—a rather vivid example of the take-apart piece. Then, as a team, the operators rebuilt the station, putting things back where they needed to be, removing tools that were not needed, and replacing any tools or equipment that were not functioning optimally. </p>
			<p>In this manner, the Kaizen event was rather disruptive but highly effective in fixing the root problems that hindered their production output. In short, not all Kaizen events are conducted like friendly Agile retrospectives. They can employ highly disruptive actions to force a needed improvement.</p>
			<p>By analogy, we can also use the flipping of a house as another example of the need to sometimes make disruptive changes. For example, in order to make the kitchen in a house more functional, it's better to rip out the existing walls, equipment, countertops, and cabinets to get a better and more functional work environment. The long-term benefits outweigh the short-term disruptions. </p>
			<p>This topic concludes the section on learning Lean concepts. Just as you need to know what Lean looks like, you also need to know what Lean doesn't look like. That is the subject of the following subsection. </p>
			<h3>Knowing when you are not Lean</h3>
			<p>Now that you know what Lean production concepts look like, let's discuss how we assess the state of Lean practices implemented within a value stream. To do this, we're going to want to look at the development and operations-oriented processes within an organization, and we need to ask ourselves a series of questions. The questions center on flow, order processing, lot size, customer demands, cleanliness, inventory management, and activity changeovers.</p>
			<p>Before we go any further, please note that the terms <em class="italic">Lean</em>, <em class="italic">Lean production</em>, and <em class="italic">Lean product development</em> are used interchangeably in this book. All three terms imply the implementation of Lean concepts across both operational and development-oriented value streams.  </p>
			<p>The first set of questions deals with the flow of work, parts, materials, and information. </p>
			<h4>Flow questions</h4>
			<p>Questions related to flow help <a id="_idIndexMarker643"/>assess the extent of wasteful transport, motion, and waiting. Specifically, you want to ask questions to discover the extent to which your organization has done the following: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Changed the layout of the facilities to support the continuous flow of work</li>
				<li>Eliminated batch processing that causes excessive inventories and bottlenecks and queues to form</li>
				<li>Taken steps to minimize the variance in changeover and cycle times across all value stream activities</li>
				<li>Taken steps to minimize the distance of transport of goods across value stream activities</li>
				<li>Taken steps to reduce travel distance, motion, heavy lifting, and bending required to perform each value stream activity</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Next, we'll look at questions that help us assess the leanness of our order management activities.</p>
			<h4>Order management questions</h4>
			<p>Once we've addressed the area of flow, we <a id="_idIndexMarker644"/>need to evaluate how orders are processed, including the arrival of parts, materials, and information. These are the questions you should ask regarding order processing within your operations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Are parts and materials ordered and supplied only when they are needed to support existing customer orders? </li>
				<li>Are orders pushed into production on receipt, whether or not there is the capacity to take on the work? </li>
				<li>Are orders received and processed as a batch or handled individually?</li>
				<li>Can operators pull work only when they have capacity? </li>
				<li>Are value stream operators working on more than one work item at a time? </li>
				<li>Do the right materials show up at the right place and at the right time across the value stream activities? </li>
				<li>Is all order and process information available on demand at each activity to perform the current work? </li>
			</ul>
			<p>At this point, we should have a pretty good idea of the efficiency of our processes in terms of flow and order processing. Now, we need to evaluate how orders are handled across the value stream in terms of lot size.</p>
			<h4>Lot-size questions</h4>
			<p>VSM practitioners attempt to <a id="_idIndexMarker645"/>match value stream inputs, outputs, and intermediate activity durations in sync with customer demands. In other words, the rate at which product orders enter the system and flow through each activity should match the rate at which our customers want the products delivered.  </p>
			<p>For example, if a customer wants 40 products delivered every week, the ideal production rate is 40 items per week, or one item every hour. To meet these customer demands across our value stream pipeline, we might introduce a new work order for one item into our production system once every hour. Likewise, each intermediate activity would cycle once every hour, and the output would be one item every hour. Production control gets much more challenging when we must move products in batches, and the durations between production and transport activities vary.</p>
			<p>Conceptually, the production control manager "orchestrates" the flow of work, much like a conductor orchestrates a band to stay in tempo. Lean practitioners use the term T<em class="italic">akt time</em>—or, more simply, <em class="italic">Takt</em>—to refer to the production tempos required to meet customer demands. Takt is the German word for the baton that conductors use to regulate an orchestra or band's tempo.</p>
			<p>Therefore, the ideal goal in <a id="_idIndexMarker646"/>Lean production is to orchestrate the flow of all materials and parts in single-piece lot sizes across all value stream activities at a constant rate of speed equal to Takt time. With that goal in mind, these are the questions you should ask regarding lot sizes within your operations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What is the batch size of work items running through your development and operational value streams? </li>
				<li>Has your organization identified the batch sizes for each activity across the value stream (that is, some equipment may optimally handle larger batch sizes than others, which can cause bottlenecks and waiting to form both upstream and downstream)? </li>
				<li>Has the organization taken efforts to move toward single-piece production across all value stream activities? </li>
				<li>What does the organization need to do to achieve single-piece production across all value stream activities? </li>
			</ul>
			<p>With the questions of flow, order processing, and lot size answered, we need to assess the Takt time for the value stream in terms of known or projected customer demands. </p>
			<h4>Customer demand questions</h4>
			<p>In this section, we need to <a id="_idIndexMarker647"/>understand the frequency of customer orders. This issue can be particularly challenging in industries with seasonally-adjusted demands, such as a Christmas rush. These are the questions you should ask regarding customer demands within your operations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Have you calculated your value stream's Takt time? </li>
				<li>Do you have historical data to show Takt time trends over time? </li>
				<li>Do you have to make seasonal adjustments to your Takt time?</li>
				<li>Do you have specific customers who place larger orders all at once in a batch?</li>
				<li>Do your value stream production rates match your Takt time? </li>
				<li>What can you do to ensure your value stream production rates equal Takt time? </li>
				<li>How well does the organization manage flow across varying customer demands? </li>
				<li>What is the organization's process for managing order entry with varying customer demands?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Lean production <a id="_idIndexMarker648"/>seeks to match production capacities to meet customer demands. The objective of asking the preceding questions is to discern how well the organization can adjust production rates to meet customer demands without losing its efficiencies in production or causing other forms of waste to accumulate.</p>
			<p>You learned earlier, in <em class="italic">The 5S system</em> section, how important it is to maintain a state of cleanliness and orderliness. Making such determinations is the focus of the next set of questions. </p>
			<h4>State-of-cleanliness questions</h4>
			<p>By now, you should already have a<a id="_idIndexMarker649"/> decent understanding of how well materials, parts, and information flow across the value stream, but it's always a good idea to ask specific questions to help discern the cause of any issues with flow, especially related to the facility's cleanliness and orderliness. These are the questions you should ask regarding cleanliness and the degree of order within your operations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Is the work area for your value stream messy or unclean? </li>
				<li>When was the last time the work area was cleaned?</li>
				<li>When was the last time the workers went through and removed any excess materials, supplies, files, folders, documents, and other paperwork?</li>
				<li>Is the work area for your value stream disorganized in terms of supporting optimal flows? </li>
				<li>What processes within the value stream exist to maintain cleanliness and organization? </li>
				<li>Is there a visual display of the cleaning and maintenance processes?</li>
				<li>Is there a checklist to ensure compliance with the cleaning and maintenance processes?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It may seem overkill to <a id="_idIndexMarker650"/>develop cleaning and maintenance processes and then display and comply with them, but investment in such efforts significantly reduces the risks of shutdowns, delays, defects, and ultimately higher costs in the longer run, which leads us to the next set of questions, which are on inventory management. </p>
			<h4>Inventory management questions</h4>
			<p>Organizations often allow queuing <a id="_idIndexMarker651"/>of materials as safety and buffer stocks. Buffer stocks allow the accumulation of materials and parts to maintain flow in abrupt changes to customer demand. Safety stocks exist within a value stream or production line to support upstream and downstream processes mismatched in cycle times and batch or lot sizes, but both safety and buffer stocks represent costly waste in terms of holding costs, delays, and their potential to hide defects and bugs.</p>
			<p>With those concerns in mind, here are the questions you should ask regarding inventory management within your operations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Does your value stream work area allow queueing of parts and materials?</li>
				<li>Does your value stream work area have defined storage buffers? </li>
				<li>Does your value stream implement strict rules on storage buffer limits? </li>
				<li>Are their production activities where materials and supplies naturally tend to accumulate and queue?</li>
				<li>Does your organization know why stocks are queuing at certain stages of their operations? </li>
				<li>Has your organization found hidden bugs and defects accumulating within their stocks and buffers? </li>
				<li>Do you have historical data on cycle times versus wait times and total lead times across your value stream? </li>
				<li>Does your value stream have processes in place to minimize queuing, wait, transport, and motion<a id="_idIndexMarker652"/> times for inventories of materials and parts? </li>
			</ul>
			<p>We are almost done with our questions. The one area we have not addressed is the impact of setup and part changeover times. That is the topic of the next set of questions.</p>
			<h4>Activity changeover questions</h4>
			<p>Equipment setup and part or <a id="_idIndexMarker653"/>work item changeover requirements seem to be a built-in necessity, but lengthy setup and changeover events impact the sizing of inventory and stock buffers needed to store materials and work in process. Therefore, from a Lean perspective, they are another major cause of waste in the form of delays and waiting, plus their potential to hide defective work items and materials.  </p>
			<p>We need to make investments to reduce, if not eliminate, setup and changeover requirements across our value stream, but first, we need to know how big a problem we might have. To answer that higher-level question, we need to look for potential causes by asking a series of questions regarding equipment setup and part changeover requirements within your operations, such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Do you have equipment that requires periodic shutdowns to set up for changes in orders, materials, or part numbers? </li>
				<li>Do you know the time required to change over equipment across your value stream activities with changes in part numbers or customer orders? </li>
				<li>What information is required to support the equipment setup?</li>
				<li>Which tooling and dies are required to support your equipment changeovers?</li>
				<li>How often do your equipment, setup procedures, or configurations fail?</li>
				<li>Is a process in place to ensure you have backups quickly available when your tooling and dies fail?</li>
				<li>Do you measure the amount of time spent in setup and changeovers along with your lead, cycle, and waiting times?</li>
				<li>Do your value stream team members have active programs to evaluate and improve excessive changeover times? </li>
				<li>Which changeover activities cause the most problems in waiting and queuing parts and materials and delays in processing? </li>
			</ul>
			<p>The preceding questions<a id="_idIndexMarker654"/> help the VSM team evaluate the state of Lean within the target value stream. Many of these questions relate directly to development-oriented value streams building physical products, but given the dependencies between operations and development-oriented value streams, problems in one value stream often create negative and unexpected consequences in their connected value streams. </p>
			<p>You should now have a pretty good understanding of what you need to know about Lean production processes across both development and operations-oriented value streams, to prioritize and make future improvements. But before we leave this section entirely, let's take a few moments to review the tools that assist the organization's efforts to learn about Lean. </p>
			<h3>Learning about Lean – tools</h3>
			<p>In this subsection, you will learn about the various tools an organization can implement to assist team members and other stakeholders in learning the basics of Lean production processes. The primary tools include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Training plan</li>
				<li>Benchmarking  checklist</li>
				<li>Demand-stage tools </li>
				<li>Flow-stage tools </li>
				<li>Leveling-stage tools</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We'll start this discussion with a review of the Lean training plan components. </p>
			<h4>Training plan</h4>
			<p>A training plan<a id="_idIndexMarker655"/> is an essential tool that helps guide an organization's efforts to build skills and knowledge among its employees and other stakeholders. A Lean training plan should include<a id="_idIndexMarker656"/> the following sections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>List of required skills and knowledge areas</li>
				<li>Plan to assess existing skills and knowledge levels across affected team members and their training needs</li>
				<li>List of available or desired training sources and materials, to include the following:<p>a) <strong class="bold">Microlearning</strong>: This involves<a id="_idIndexMarker657"/> developing and deploying short and precise units of content for teaching key Lean concepts or practices. The modules must be easily discoverable, engaging, and contextually useful.</p><p>b) <strong class="bold">Audiovisual</strong>: This involves<a id="_idIndexMarker658"/> integrating both sight and sound formats, typically as slides or video content and recorded speech, to demonstrate Lean concepts. May have overlays of music to make the content more engaging.</p><p>c) <strong class="bold">Interactive content</strong>: This can<a id="_idIndexMarker659"/> be web-based or part of a multimedia presentation. This instruction approach asks employees to complete specific tasks, such as taking a quiz or poll, engaging in community boards, or employing gaming approaches to test students' approaches to solving specific problems.</p><p>d) <strong class="bold">Images</strong>: Photos, infographics, and diagrams provided in context with text-based instructions<a id="_idIndexMarker660"/> help illustrate Lean concepts and activities.</p><p>e) <strong class="bold">Podcasts</strong>: Audio or<a id="_idIndexMarker661"/> audio-visual content can help employees find time to learn Lean concepts from the organization's mentors and coaches in non-traditional learning environments—that is, outside the classroom or office.</p></li>
				<li>Training content development plans</li>
				<li>Training <a id="_idIndexMarker662"/>delivery schedule</li>
				<li>An evaluation process to discern training effectiveness </li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Benchmarking checklist</h4>
			<p>Benchmarking is a powerful tool to collect information about how other organizational value <a id="_idIndexMarker663"/>streams—or even other organizations—employ Lean practices, but to take full advantage <a id="_idIndexMarker664"/>of this approach, the benchmark assessment team must prepare their list of questions before meeting with the organization they are benchmarking. The benchmark checklist should clearly define the information you seek to obtain. </p>
			<p>You must identify an organization that you believe represents world-class capabilities in the Lean value stream area you wish to emulate, and it would help if you made sure that the benchmark organization is sufficiently motivated to work with your team. This task can be challenging, as you need to figure out what's in it for them to support your efforts. It also helps to know something about the benchmark organization before meeting with them so that they know you have done your homework and are not wasting their time. </p>
			<p>It's usually best to send your proposed questions in advance of your meeting to give them time to prepare. When you meet with the benchmark organization, it's best to have more than one person attend from the benchmarking team to divide and conquer, with one person asking questions and the other taking notes. Likewise, you may want to ask the benchmark organization to include more than one member, to sufficiently provide the expertise to cover the topics you wish to discuss. </p>
			<p>Now, let's move on to discuss Lean demand-phase tools. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note </p>
			<p class="callout">The terms <em class="italic">phase</em> and <em class="italic">stage</em> are used interchangeably across the three Lean application processes of demand, flow, and<a id="_idTextAnchor179"/> leveling.</p>
			<h4>Demand-phase tools</h4>
			<p>In this chapter, you learned <a id="_idIndexMarker665"/>about three Lean application stages: <strong class="bold">demand</strong>, <strong class="bold">flow</strong>, and <strong class="bold">leveling</strong>. This subsection introduces the tools of the demand-phase stage, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Takt time</strong>: This is the pace of customer demand. Takt time<a id="_idIndexMarker666"/> is a measure of available production time divided by the total quantity required in that same period (that is, seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months). In short, Takt time is a measure of time divided by volume. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Pitch</strong>: This is the amount<a id="_idIndexMarker667"/> of time, based on Takt time, required for an upstream operation to release a predetermined quantity of work in process to a downstream customer. The issue is a concern when the upstream process must bulk-deliver a batch of items all at once. <p>For example, your customer may order products in bulk, shipped by the boxload, or a truckload, or in a shipping container. Bulk orders are often cheaper and become part of the customer's purchase decision even when the arrivals don't match the company's ideal goal of a single-piece flow. On the other hand, as a producer, you may prefer the certainty of knowing your customer is willing to place an order for 1,000 widgets every month, and therefore you want to ship them most cost-effectively.</p><p>The way to resolve this issue is to calculate a <strong class="bold">pitch</strong> rate equal to the Takt time multiplied by the bulk pack quality. If your Takt time is 6 minutes and the ideal shipping size is 100 widgets per container, your pitch is 600 minutes. Therefore, you should be able to release 100 widgets every 10 production hours. This pitch also means you can release 100 of the customer's monthly widget orders every 10 hours to the value stream. The formula is illustrated here: <em class="italic">6 minutes (Takt time) X 100 widgets = 600 minutes.</em></p><p>The pitch concept applies in reverse too—for example, perhaps your value stream is unable to produce single-piece flows. Let's assume a value stream has a Takt time of 30<a id="_idIndexMarker668"/> seconds but must produce in batch sizes of 20 pieces. In this scenario, the value stream's pitch is 300 seconds, which means 10 new orders are released every 5 minutes.  The formula is illustrated here: <em class="italic">30 seconds (Takt Time) X 10 pieces = 300 seconds.</em></p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Takt image</strong>: This is a <a id="_idIndexMarker669"/>visualization process where the value team members must have a vision of achieving single-piece flows and have eliminated all forms of waste. The ideal is never fully obtainable. Following the 80/20 rule (that is, the Pareto principle), there is always something we can improve—and that's the whole point. Never stop visualizing <a id="_idIndexMarker670"/>ways to improve your value stream activities, and always seek to obtain Lean ideals.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Buffer and safety inventories</strong>: Buffer stocks and safety inventories are forms of waste and are highly discouraged. However, in the short run, until reaching your improved future state, you may need buffers and safety inventories to meet customer demands. <p><strong class="bold">Buffer inventories</strong> are <a id="_idIndexMarker671"/>stocks of finished goods that are available to ensure delivery when customer demand suddenly increases—in other words, to protect against large variances in Takt time. </p><p>In contrast, <strong class="bold">safety inventories</strong> are<a id="_idIndexMarker672"/> stocks of finished goods to protect against internal issues that slow down or prevent work in progress (that is, labor problems, material availability, quality problems, equipment reliability problems, and changeovers). </p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Finished-goods supermarket</strong>: Conceptually, imagine customers pulling orders off your value stream <a id="_idIndexMarker673"/>shelf when they need them, just as customers pull products from grocery store shelves when they need them. In a supermarket, staff periodically replenish items on shelves as a batch process, but customers pull the items off the shelves in smaller lots on demand. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lights-out manufacturing</strong>: Conceptually, this includes any Lean production process that can run in an automated fashion without an operator in attendance. In DevOps, for <a id="_idIndexMarker674"/>example, we may run automated testing processes overnight to check for bugs and defects that the <a id="_idIndexMarker675"/>software developers can fix when they come back into the office the following day. <p>If part or all of your value stream operates in this manner, here are some factors to consider: </p><p>a) How durable is the automated process? </p><p>b) How reliable are the materials and information needed to execute the process?</p><p>c) How complex are the material and information flows needed to execute the process? </p><p>d) What is the optimal lot size to run in automated mode? </p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This section completes our introduction to the Lean demand-phase tools. We'll move on to introduce the tools that support the Lean flow-improvement phase. </p>
			<h4>Flow-phase tools</h4>
			<p>This<a id="_idIndexMarker676"/> subsection introduces the tools of the flow phase or <a id="_idIndexMarker677"/>stage. First, we'll start with an introduction to continuous flows, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Continuous flow</strong>: This is also known as one-for-one manufacturing. A continuous flow<a id="_idIndexMarker678"/> is an <a id="_idIndexMarker679"/>ideal state; each activity within a value stream pulls one work item from the upstream activity and only works on that one product. But continuous flows also work in a less ideal state, where each activity pulls one small lot from the upstream activity and then works on that small lot to completion. It's unnecessary to have everything across the value stream moving in lock sync, but that is the idealized goal. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Work cells</strong>: The layout of <a id="_idIndexMarker680"/>working facilities is critical in both Agile and Lean practices. When time and space allow, it's best to arrange<a id="_idIndexMarker681"/> workstations and equipment sequentially to support the workflow. It's often useful for labor-intensive activities to have counterclockwise flows that support the efforts of predominantly right-handed workers as they move through the cell—that is, studies show that anywhere from 70% to 90% of people are right-handed. <p>Move equipment and workstations close together while considering safety factors to minimize motion and transport between stations. While we want our work to flow sequentially, we do not need to have a linear flow. Instead, it's often better to locate the last station in the value stream close to the first station, which means a U-shaped working environment is often the most optimal. However, other shapes can work, such as C-shaped, L-shaped, S-shaped, or V-shaped cells. Equipment and resource constraints and availability most often dictate the best shape for the design of a cell. </p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Line balancing</strong>: Try as<a id="_idIndexMarker682"/> hard as we might, very often, the cycle times for the activities that participate in a value stream vary. Continuous flows are difficult to achieve in such environments, causing excessive queuing and wait times. One strategy to overcome this problem is line balancing.  <p>Line balancing is a<a id="_idIndexMarker683"/> process in which we combine work activities to distribute the flow of work to create roughly equal cycle times (a.k.a. processing times). By definition, cycle time is the time from the start of an activity until its completion. We would love our cycle times to have the same duration as Takt time, but that's seldom the case. That's especially true when Takt time varies over time. </p><p>The following diagram <a id="_idIndexMarker684"/>provides an example of a U-shaped value stream that has grouped activities to balance flow in terms of matching cycle times. The goal is to have each grouping have a cycle time of around 30 seconds, which matches the cycle times for the lengthiest activities <strong class="bold">A1</strong>, <strong class="bold">A4</strong>, <strong class="bold">A7</strong>, and <strong class="bold">A12</strong>: </p></li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer060" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_6.8.jpg" alt="Figure 6.8 – Line-balancing example&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.8 – Line-balancing example</p>
			<p>Also, note that the total cycle time across all 12 activities is 210 seconds, including 7 cells times 30 seconds each. Of course, we have not included wait times. Since we have <a id="_idIndexMarker685"/>balanced our line, we would hope there would be no waiting times in this example.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, we seldom get such an ideal world as that displayed in <em class="italic">Figure 6.8</em>. For example, very often, value streams produce multiple variants of a product, service, or result. Each product variant may require different processing times and have a different setup or changeover requirements. They may even traverse the value stream in different work patterns and utilize labor in different ways. </p>
			<p>Analyzing methods to balance a value stream in such circumstances is beyond the scope of this book. However, if you find yourself in such a situation, it can help to develop an <strong class="bold">operator balance chart</strong> as a visual display of work elements, time requirements, and <a id="_idIndexMarker686"/>operators for each activity. </p>
			<p>The development of an operator balance chart is a two-step process. First, we want to create a quick table to show each product-line activity's cycle times. We also want to show how many operators are required for each activity and how many operators must support the entire set of value stream activities.  </p>
			<p>The following screenshot provides an example of a preparation table for an operator balance chart:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer061" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_6.9.jpg" alt="Figure 6.9 – Operator balance chart preparation table&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.9 – Operator balance chart preparation table</p>
			<p>Next, we create a bar chart showing the activities and their cycle times, with a line showing takt time. The next step is to evaluate ways to balance flows by combining activities with faster cycle times and methods to share resources across the activities.  </p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows an example of an operator balance chart for a single product. Similar charts need to be developed across product lines: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer062" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_6.10.jpg" alt="Figure 6.10 – Operator balance chart&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.10 – Operator balance chart</p>
			<p>Now, let's turn our attention <a id="_idIndexMarker687"/>to a visual display that helps ensure workers perform their activities in a standardized approach via a standardized worksheet.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Standardized worksheet</strong>: This kind of<a id="_idIndexMarker688"/> worksheet is a visual aid in chart form that displays the sequence of operations across the <a id="_idIndexMarker689"/>value stream. A standardized worksheet should display activity cycle times, quality checks, safety precautions, standard working <a id="_idIndexMarker690"/>processes, number of pieces as <strong class="bold">work in progress</strong> (<strong class="bold">WIP</strong>), takt time, total cycle time, and the number of operators. <p>The following screenshot shows a standard worksheet in this type of format: </p></li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer063" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_6.11.jpg" alt="Figure 6.11 – Standardized worksheet&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.11 – Standardized worksheet</p>
			<p>Another <a id="_idIndexMarker691"/>display approach is to create a worksheet in<a id="_idIndexMarker692"/> tabular form to display information on activity sequences, activity descriptions, and activity durations. The following screenshot shows <a id="_idIndexMarker693"/>a <strong class="bold">standard work combination sheet</strong> employing this format:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer064" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_6.12.jpg" alt="Figure 6.12 – Standard work combination sheet&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.12 – Standard work combination sheet</p>
			<p>The next item we'll discuss is the quick changeover method, which can keep changeovers to a single minute or less. </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Quick changeover</strong>: As the name<a id="_idIndexMarker694"/> implies, this method is all about ensuring we can quickly change over from one activity to another, even <a id="_idIndexMarker695"/>when the product type changes. The concept comes from the work of Shigeo Shingo at Toyota to develop methods to enable SMED. <p>The time and effort spent to change over equipment and materials between activities are all wasted from a customer's perspective. They want to pay for finished goods, not activities to set up equipment or retrieve information. The latter concern (retrieving the correct information promptly) most affects IT specialists assisting in value stream improvements. </p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Autonomous maintenance</strong>: In a <a id="_idIndexMarker696"/>manufacturing context, autonomous maintenance<a id="_idIndexMarker697"/> activities seek to eliminate potential equipment failure causes. In other words, we can think of these strategies as preventative maintenance. We have similar community needs, particularly in operations-oriented value streams, to implement appropriate maintenance, security, rollback, and failover capabilities. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">In-processed supermarkets</strong>: As <a id="_idIndexMarker698"/>introduced previously, supermarkets provide a finished goods inventory buffer from which clients can pull products on-demand. However, when it's challenging to achieve a continuous flow across a value stream, in-process supermarket strategies <a id="_idIndexMarker699"/>allow queues to build midstream so that upstream activities have WIP to pull as their capacity becomes available. This strategy helps alleviate production shortfalls when there are multiple demands made against a single machine or activity. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kanban system</strong>: This is a<a id="_idIndexMarker700"/> signaling-based pool system that uses cards attached to containers of materials to indicate standard lot sizes. When<a id="_idIndexMarker701"/> the container's materials are depleted, the card indicates which materials need to be replaced, as well as how many items.<p>Kanban systems have become popular in the IT-based Lean-Agile community, though the approach differs slightly from the original Lean production concepts. The IT-based Kanban system usually employs a whiteboard with vertical lines segmenting the board into columns mapped to the team's development process's activity steps. Team members write the product backlog item names on sticky notes to allow placement across the columns. As team members become available to take on new work, they look in the upstream activity column to see the work items available for them to work on next, and they make their work selections from those items. </p><p>The IT-based Kanban system's value is that it facilitates a continuous flow of work across software development activities. In traditional Agile processes, such as Scrum or <strong class="bold">extreme programming</strong> (<strong class="bold">XP</strong>), work items are pulled as a batch into the Sprint backlog, and duration of the Sprint constrains the flow of the batch of work items.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">FIFO lanes</strong>: FIFO is a<a id="_idIndexMarker702"/> production control strategy used in Lean value streams when there is a great deal of variability between work items and <a id="_idIndexMarker703"/>where multiple value streams meet for final assembly or customization of products. In such cases, we need to make sure parts don't get stuck in the queue because nobody wants to work on them or make the required changeovers. A FIFO strategy ensures that products waiting in the queue the longest always have the highest priorities.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Production scheduling</strong>: This has <a id="_idIndexMarker704"/>to do with scheduling parts and materials to support the flow of work across a Lean value stream. You <a id="_idIndexMarker705"/>can also throw information scheduling into the mix to ensure the information on customer order requirements also shows up at the right time and in the proper context with each activity within the value stream. The main point is that, in a pull-oriented system, production schedules and inventory control systems must coordinate upstream activities to support the needs of the downstream operations closest to the customer. <p>It can admittedly be challenging to get your head around pull-oriented production processes. Intuitively, it seems to make sense that when a new customer order comes in, we should immediately push it out to the production floor and allow each succeeding stage of production to push the product through the manufacturing process. But as you now know, pushing products through the production process only creates queues and waiting times, hides bugs and defects, and creates other forms of waste that hinder productivity while increasing costs. </p><p>As practiced within Lean enterprises, a better strategy is to conceptually have each downstream activity pulling the order through the production process. Implementing pull-oriented production-scheduling strategies exposes problems immediately, as downstream activities become starved of work due to impediments upstream. Moreover, the organization needs to refine its information systems to ensure parts and materials arrive in the proper sequence, to the right locations, at the right times. </p><p>The IT departments within Lean organizations must work in concert with the value streams to develop business information systems that support the new Lean process. </p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This section completes our introduction to the tools that support continuous flows. Next, we'll move on to introduce the Lean leveling-phase tools.</p>
			<h4>Leveling-phase tools</h4>
			<p>We can't move on to <a id="_idIndexMarker706"/>improving production load levels until we've addressed customer demands and flow issues, but now that we've done so, we can look at the tools that help us level the flow across our value streams to make them most productive and efficient. This subsection introduces the tools of the leveling<a id="_idIndexMarker707"/> phase or stage, outlined as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Paced withdrawal</strong> facilitates<a id="_idIndexMarker708"/> delivery of products when customers want deliveries made in standard pack-out quantities instead of one-at-a-time <a id="_idIndexMarker709"/>deliveries. However, paced withdrawal only works when you have no product variability in the value stream. In other words, production flows are stable, there is little or no changeover between product lines, and cycle times are roughly equivalent. <p>The timing of paced withdrawals is equal to pitch. Recall that pitch is equal to takt time times pack-out quantity. Paced withdrawal helps level production flows by dividing the total downstream customer's requirement over a specified duration of time into batch sizes equal to the pack-out quantity. </p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Heijunka (load leveling)</strong> is a better <a id="_idIndexMarker710"/>and more robust approach <a id="_idIndexMarker711"/>to level-production schedules in value streams having mismatched activities in their production processes. Heijunka uses the paced withdrawal method of production leveling based on the pitch but breaks it out into Kanban units based on the volume and variety of production products. <p><em class="italic">Figure 6.12</em> shows an example of a Heijunka load-leveling table. Let's assume this Lean value stream can produce 500 units of a product per day across five basic product line variants (that is, products <strong class="bold">A</strong> through <strong class="bold">E</strong>), and we'll assume our downstream customers have the same batch delivery requirements of 25 units per batch. </p><p>Additionally, our value stream only operates one shift per day for a total available production time of 28,800 minutes. Therefore, our takt time equals the available time of 28,800 minutes divided by our production volume of 500 units, or 57.6 seconds, while our pitch equals takt time multiplied by our lot size of 25, or 1,440 seconds (24 minutes). In other words, every 24 minutes, we need to be able to ship another lot of 25 units of product.</p><p>But now, we need to decide the frequency of deliveries by product line. To do this, we need to know the daily production volumes of each product type. By dividing the daily demands by<a id="_idIndexMarker712"/> product type by the pack-out size, we can determine how many <a id="_idIndexMarker713"/>Kanbans we can form and release each day for each product type. The following screenshot shows the number of Kanbans required for each product type:</p></li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer065" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_6.13.jpg" alt="Figure 6.13 – Heijunka load-leveling table&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.13 – Heijunka load-leveling table</p>
			<p>We can also see that we need a total of 20 Kanbans of 25 units each produced during the shift. Finally, the <a id="_idIndexMarker714"/>Heijunka table helps us evaluate how the Kanbans divide out across the product types (as shown in the bottom row of <em class="italic">Figure 6.13</em>).</p>
			<p>Now that we've figured out how many Kanbans we need for each product type, we can figure out how to schedule them into production. A Heijunka box, as discussed next, is a good approach. </p>

				<li>A <strong class="bold">Heijunka box</strong>, as initially conceived, is a physical box to hold the Kanban cards in slots mapped to <a id="_idIndexMarker715"/>specific periods during the<a id="_idIndexMarker716"/> day. The objective of a Heijunka box is to level the load across fixed periods. However, we can schedule and level our Kanbans similarly in an electronic chart or table format. The following screenshot shows such an example: </li>

			<p>Sometimes, we have to resort to brute force to get things done promptly. That approach to production scheduling and leveling is the topic of the following method. </p>

				<li><strong class="bold">A runner</strong> is a person <a id="_idIndexMarker717"/>who moves from one activity location to another to <a id="_idIndexMarker718"/>move materials and address production issues on the fly. The primary objective of a runner is to ensure that pitch is maintained. They usually traverse a designated route within the pitch, picking up Kanban cards, supplying tools and materials, and delivering them to the right place at the right time. <p>A runner can't be just anybody or a new employee who has a strong understanding of the value stream production activities and requirements. They must have excellent communication skills and be able to recognize problems and report any abnormalities that are hindering flow. They must understand Lean concepts and the importance of takt time and pitch. Finally, they must be able to perform their work efficiently and accurately. </p></li>

			<h4>VSM storyboard updates </h4>
			<p>Another tool that<a id="_idIndexMarker719"/> you need to have ready to use in your learning Lean VSM step is a VSM storyboard. Recall that a VSM storyboard is a visual tool that provides updates to your VSM project's information, metrics, and value stream maps. This phase's primary update to the VSM storyboard documents the problem categories or issues your VSM team may choose to address.</p>
			<p>If you haven't already done so, you should create your VSM storyboard now. All you need to get started is a simple large whiteboard with markers located in a shared or colocated space. You can use the VSM storyboard provided in <em class="italic">Appendix B</em> as an example to help guide your VSM team's efforts to build their storyboard. Note that the example VSM storyboard in <em class="italic">Appendix B</em> has numbered icons to indicate the information updates required across each of the VSM steps. </p>
			<p>With the information you've learned in this chapter, you are now ready to start mapping your current-state value stream map, the next chapter's topic. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor180"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This section ends our chapter on planning and preparing for your VSM engagement. At the start of this chapter, you learned that VSM is a Lean business approach to improve the flow of value across an organization and manage and monitor the development and delivery life cycle from end to end. You've learned that VSM is not a new concept. There are eight traditional steps to planning, mapping, and improving Lean production processes across development and operations-oriented value streams. </p>
			<p>Most importantly, you learned that VSM could not be merely about improving IT operations in a DevOps paradigm. Instead, VSM serves as a force multiplier within our digital economy that leverages Lean and DevOps capabilities to improve, monitor, and manage all the organization's development and operations-oriented value streams.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, you will learn how to map both your value stream operations' current and future states. You will also learn how to implement Lean Kaizen (that is, continuous improvement) processes sustainably. But before we get to that chapter, let's take a moment to review what you've learned in this chapter. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor181"/>Questions</h1>
			<p>To enhance your learning experience, please take a few moments to answer these 10 questions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">What is VSM fundamentally about?</li>
				<li>List three reasons why Lean practices are critical to an organization.</li>
				<li>What is a viable strategy to determine the degree of "Leanness" within your selected value stream?</li>
				<li>What are the three stages of Lean application? </li>
