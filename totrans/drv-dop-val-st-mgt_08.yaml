    succinctly, JIT is about making only what's needed, only when it's needed.

    **Toyota Production System** (**TPS**). Shigeo Shingo worked for Toyota, implemented
    its **Single-Minute Exchange of Dies** (**SMED**) and **Poka-Yoke** (mistake-proofing)
    concepts, and published the first detailed assessment of Toyota's production processes.

    function until there is available capacity to perform the work. Pushing orders
    and materials into a production environment faster than its production flow rate
    only causes waste in the form of inventory carrying costs, waiting, and hidden
    defects. Therefore, Lean enterprise executives know their employees must pull
    work into their value streams only when capacity becomes available and that materials,
    parts, and information must arrive just in time to support the operations, and

    our customers want, when they need them, and at a competitive price.

    classical hierarchical organizational structures. Instead, as Toyota grew into
    a global conglomerate, they established regional and product-line divisions with
    increased decision-making authority granted at the division level. The creation
    of regional divisions allows each geographic business unit to tailor products
    and services to meet local market needs. In contrast, the product-line divisions

    and the VSM teams must be willing to show their findings (**transparency**), examine
    their findings (**inspection**), and be flexible in responding appropriately and
    aggressively where change is needed (**adaptive**).

    know that, from the perspective of Lean, the term *value* implies the delivery
    of value in the form of a product, service, or result that you are creating for
    an internal or external customer. Moreover, the concept of value implies the activities
    are providing results your customers are willing to purchase.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In reality, our value streams always include elements of waste to one degree
    or another. Activities that produce results that are irrelevant to your customers'
    needs are forms of waste, and we need to make our best efforts to eliminate them—and
    that is the point of *Kaizen*, the Japanese term for continuous improvement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The term *value* in Lean applies to the work we do in our value streams and
    our VSM activities. But you may have asked yourself what the term *stream* implies.
    It's literally as straightforward as you might think. Metaphorically, the term
    *stream* refers to a sequential flow of activities that create value, therefore
    VSM improves the flow of value across our organization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Conceptually, work items flow downstream across the value stream activities,
    just like water flows downstream in a creek or river. Metaphorically, as water
    in streams and rivers ultimately flows to the oceans, Lean-oriented value flows
    to our customers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lean practitioners understand that value streams include both value-added and
    non-value-added work activities. In the long run, we want to eliminate the non-value-added
    work activities, though it may not be practical to do so in the short run.

  prefs: []

- en: For example, let's say that our engineers know how to improve **Activity 2**
    to bring the cycle time down to 1 hour. At first glance, that seems a reasonable
    thing to do. However, the problem is that the system's major bottleneck is at
    **Activity 4** because it has a significantly greater cycle time of 3.5 hours.
    Improving the upstream activities' speeds only means more products queue at the
    entry to **Activity 4**, and the flow is not improved.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This example is elementary, as there are other variables to consider when improving
    flows. We might have setup times that can be improved through better tooling.
    We may have high levels of defects that cost the organization more than the slow
    output of **Activity 4**. So far, our value stream map doesn't say anything about
    the lot or batch sizes or buffer stock limits, all of which can significantly
    change the throughput and queuing across each of the identified activities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All we know so far is the activity cycle times and the basic flow of materials.
    However, we can already see that this model does not indicate a Lean value stream.
    Instead, it's probably much more like the situations you find in organizations
    that have not yet made the transition to Lean. For example, the arrows indicate
    the materials are pushed to each downstream activity, and there are buffer stocks
    between each activity to contain overflow due to the mismatched cycle times.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that the overall wait time is 37 hours against a total lead time of 44.5
    hours. In other words, only 7.5 hours of work is included in the overall lead
    time. The most likely cause is the mismatched cycle times and lot sizes, but we
    need to analyze the flow across the value stream to confirm the actual cause and
    effects.

    digital features is that product updates can be streamed live to the products,
    enhancing existing products without costly maintenance or service calls.

    digital services to support the value streams associated with product and marketing
    management. As our example, *Figure 6.3* displays an **adaptive productizing process**

    **Product Planning**, and **Market Analysis**—and two **marketing management subprocesses**—**Go
    To Market** and **Sales Enablement**.
  prefs: []

    spokes of the wheel, that deliver value within the adaptive marketing process.
    Ideally, each workflow is streamlined to deliver value with minimal, if any, waste.
    In this context, each spoke is a form of value stream. Also, based on the unique
    needs of every product, and the variety of needs across a product's life cycle,
    the execution of these processes will vary over the life of each product.

    organization track and respond to customer demands. Adaptive product and marketing
    management approaches evolved to support emergent business models such as **Software

    Web 2.0, and selling to customers via **business-to-business** (**B2B**) and **business-to-consumer**

    information systems, we need to take these concerns into account.'

    the work performed by a hub-and-spoke message broker to simplify communications,
    data flows, and asynchronous transformations. Unfortunately, a point-to-point
    process and information integration strategy won't work, as there are too many
    points of integration. Plus, there is no way the development team can account
    for every possible information flow or activity interaction across the adaptive
    productizing process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    elements of the overall value stream. Each spoke of the hub represents a standalone
    activity or subprocess. Moreover, each subprocess can be invoked by other subprocesses
    as the need arises. For each product or product family, evaluate the overall product
    management and product marketing value streams to identify where the flow constraints
    form bottlenecks and where waste hinders the overall process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    marketing value stream to another in the adaptive productizing process. In Lean-oriented
    production processes, work is always pulled on demand when it's needed by the
    upstream customer or succeeding activity.
  prefs: []

    **Routes to Market**, and other associated subprocesses are potential value stream
    workflow components. Each workflow component potentially includes multiple activities
    and techniques. The component subprocesses have different cycle times and wait
    times. They all likely have a mix of value-adding and non-value-adding activities
    and other forms of waste that should be cleaned up over time.

    of activities and the potential for interactions across product and marketing
    management value streams. With this analogy, you should gain insights into why

    practices where we calculate the price of a product by adding up costs and then
    applying desired profit margins. The problem with this strategy is that the focus
    is neither on the customer nor on how to improve. Without understanding how our
    customers assess value, we can't know what price they are willing to pay. Moreover,
    if we don't focus on optimizing value delivery and price this accordingly, we
    open ourselves to losing business to our competitors.

    equipment mismatched with the rate of flow across other value stream activities.
    Recalling the ideal of single-piece flows, we already know that batch processing

    a Japanese manufacturing plant. The production at a specific workstation suffered
    from a disorganized execution of the production tasks. However, rather than iteratively
    improve the station, the managers took the tools and threw them all on the floor—a
    rather vivid example of the take-apart piece. Then, as a team, the operators rebuilt
    the station, putting things back where they needed to be, removing tools that
    were not needed, and replacing any tools or equipment that were not functioning
    optimally.

    activities to have counterclockwise flows that support the efforts of predominantly
    right-handed workers as they move through the cell—that is, studies show that
    anywhere from 70% to 90% of people are right-handed.'
  prefs:

    to minimize motion and transport between stations. While we want our work to flow
    sequentially, we do not need to have a linear flow. Instead, it's often better
    to locate the last station in the value stream close to the first station, which
    means a U-shaped working environment is often the most optimal. However, other
    shapes can work, such as C-shaped, L-shaped, S-shaped, or V-shaped cells. Equipment
    and resource constraints and availability most often dictate the best shape for
    the design of a cell.

    strategy to overcome this problem is line balancing.'
  prefs:

    the flow of work to create roughly equal cycle times (a.k.a. processing times).
    By definition, cycle time is the time from the start of an activity until its
    completion. We would love our cycle times to have the same duration as Takt time,

    time.

    Team members write the product backlog item names on sticky notes to allow placement

    move materials and address production issues on the fly. The primary objective
    of a runner is to ensure that pitch is maintained. They usually traverse a designated
    route within the pitch, picking up Kanban cards, supplying tools and materials,
    and delivering them to the right place at the right time.'

    of the value stream production activities and requirements. They must have excellent
    communication skills and be able to recognize problems and report any abnormalities
    that are hindering flow. They must understand Lean concepts and the importance
    of takt time and pitch. Finally, they must be able to perform their work efficiently
    and accurately.

- en: Another tool that you need to have ready to use in your learning Lean VSM step
    is a VSM storyboard. Recall that a VSM storyboard is a visual tool that provides
    updates to your VSM project's information, metrics, and value stream maps. This
    phase's primary update to the VSM storyboard documents the problem categories
    or issues your VSM team may choose to address.

    you need to get started is a simple large whiteboard with markers located in a
    shared or colocated space. You can use the VSM storyboard provided in *Appendix
    B* as an example to help guide your VSM team's efforts to build their storyboard.
    Note that the example VSM storyboard in *Appendix B* has numbered icons to indicate
    the information updates required across each of the VSM steps.

- en: This section ends our chapter on planning and preparing for your VSM engagement.
    At the start of this chapter, you learned that VSM is a Lean business approach
    to improve the flow of value across an organization and manage and monitor the
    development and delivery life cycle from end to end. You've learned that VSM is
    not a new concept. There are eight traditional steps to planning, mapping, and
    improving Lean production processes across development and operations-oriented
    value streams.

- en: Most importantly, you learned that VSM could not be merely about improving IT
    operations in a DevOps paradigm. Instead, VSM serves as a force multiplier within
    our digital economy that leverages Lean and DevOps capabilities to improve, monitor,
    and manage all the organization's development and operations-oriented value streams.

    current and future states. You will also learn how to implement Lean Kaizen (that
    is, continuous improvement) processes sustainably. But before we get to that chapter,
    let's take a moment to review what you've learned in this chapter.
