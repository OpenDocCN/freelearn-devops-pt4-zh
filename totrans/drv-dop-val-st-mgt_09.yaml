    to eliminate perceived areas of waste, the problem is that, without proper analysis,
    your efforts may not get the results you and your VSM team expect. Without a current
    state value stream map, you may not be aware of the system-wide impacts associated
    with your current value stream activities. Specifically, we need to document our
    existing activity flows, order entry system, production control system, cycle
    times, equipment setup and product changeover times, lot and batch sizes, quality
    levels, defects, and unsynchronized material and information flows.

    the current way things are done (*as-is state*), then assess areas for improvement
    to achieve a desired future state (*to-be state*), conduct analysis to understand
    the full scope of work to make the desired changes (*gap analysis*), and finally
    create and execute a transition plan. You will find that VSM practices follow
    a similar pattern. This chapter introduces how to use value stream mapping to
    assess the current *as-is state* of our CI/CD activities from a Lean-oriented

    *Defining Value Stream Management*, the concept of **value stream mapping** has
    been around for a while. However, it is primarily attributed to an analytical
    approach used at Toyota, referred to as materials and information flow mapping.
    As the term *materials and information flow* suggests, value stream mapping provides
    a graphical technique to simultaneously model the flow of materials and information
    across value stream activities. But before we get into the details of value stream
    mapping, let’s first understand how this technique differs from other business
    modeling techniques.

    systems engineering** (**CASE**) tools are probably familiar with business process
    modeling techniques. For example, the **Object Management Group®** (**OMG®**)
    **Business Process Model and Notation** (**BPMN**) specification is a standard
    specification for business process modeling within the IT community.

    Modeling Language** (**UML**) and the **Integrated DEFinition for Process Description
    Capture Method** (**IDEF3**). The UML was initially created by Rational Software
    but is now an OMG standard, while the **United States** (**US**) Air Force developed
    IDEF3 under the **Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing** (**ICAM**) program.
    Additionally, IT specialists may also be familiar with various workflow modeling
    tools and techniques, such as the **Web Services Business Process Execution Language**
    (**WS-BPEL**), which is often shortened to simply **BPEL**. BPEL is a standard
    executable language for specifying business process actions within web services.

    why we need a different standard for modeling Lean business practices. The answer

    and provide an ideal infographic design to document, communicate, and ultimately
    eliminate waste that affects efficiencies and an organization’s ability to deliver
    customer-centric value. As its name implies, value stream mapping forces an organization
    to isolate activities that add value from other activities and wasteful practices
    accumulated from bureaucratic bloat. The overall objective of value stream mapping
    is to identify and eliminate waste that hinders productivity—from ideation through
    the delivery of products and services—and hinders an organization’s ability to
    deliver customer-centric value.

    visual collaborations among VSM and value stream team members and other stakeholders.

    business systems do not help support the flow of work from a value stream perspective.

    a process that is so mismatched in throughput or hiding defects, or bloated with

    flow that matches our takt time. In other words, ideally, our production rates
    (Takt) match our customers’ demand rates. The one area where this is challenging
    is in the frontend of the **software development life cycle** (**SDLC**), where
    the product owner and the team identify, prioritize, and refine requirements.
    Next, the software team must evaluate the work involved to design and implement
    the requirements as software features and functions. Finally, there is a creative
    nature to product backlog refinement that makes it more challenging to predict
    work scope and duration.

    work can follow a standard set of time-bound activities that are reasonably standardized
    and predictable. However, it’s much more challenging to force arbitrary time-bound
    restrictions on a product backlog refinement’s creative endeavors. Instead, the
    best strategy to improve design-related work predictability is to break the initial
    high-level requirements down into the smallest bites possible.
