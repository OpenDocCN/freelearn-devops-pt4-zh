			<p>In the previous chapter, you learned how to map the current state, perform a Lean office assessment, and observe and record critical Lean metrics for the value stream. You also learned how to document important information relevant to the flow of work and information across the value stream. Most importantly, you learned how to visualize work and information flows from the perspective of Lean. </p>
			<p>The work that's been performed in the current VS mapping exercise is documentary in nature. It does not involve much imagination – just accuracy in discovery (through Gemba walks), recording, and mapping. Now, we will enter the creative phase of Lean value stream mapping and design an improved future state. <strong class="bold">Future state mapping</strong> occurs in three sequential phases to help evaluate methods and improve the value stream's ability to meet customer demands, establish and maintain continuous flows, and level the distribution of customer orders to maximize operational efficiencies. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Modeling three future state objectives</li>
				<li>Phase 1 of future state mapping – customer demand</li>
				<li>Phase 2 of future state mapping – continuous flows</li>
				<li>Phase 3 of future state mapping – leveling</li>
			</ul>
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor235"/>Specifically, you will learn how to develop your skills by combining Lean and Agile practices to implement continuous improvements, and incorporate the concepts of Lean Thinking in your CI/CD and DevOps pipeline implementations. You will start this learning journey by covering an introduction to the three phases of future state modeling: the customer demand phase, the continuous flow phase, and the leveling phase.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-190"><a id="_idTextAnchor236"/>Modeling three future state objectives</h1>
			<p>This section provides instructions on conducting future state mapping exercises across three phases, involving analyzing customer demands, continuous flows, and leveling. The following list contains quick descriptions of the work involved in each phase:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer demand phase</strong>: This includes <a id="_idIndexMarker876"/>analyzing <a id="_idIndexMarker877"/>customer demands for your products or services so that they include quality objectives and lead time.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Continuous flow phase</strong>: This helps <a id="_idIndexMarker878"/>improve flows so <a id="_idIndexMarker879"/>that our customers receive the right products or services at the right time and with the right features and quantities.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Leveling phase</strong>: This helps distribute <a id="_idIndexMarker880"/>work evenly across <a id="_idIndexMarker881"/>product lines, reduce waiting times, and eliminate batch processing (that is, the goal is to achieve single-piece flows).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>While there is likely to be overlap between the three phases, the initial analysis will follow these three stages.  </p>
			<p>Value streams operate as pipeline flows that have inputs, a sequence or work activities, and outputs. In more complex environments, we can expect integrated branching with other value streams or even activities. For these reasons, it is virtually impossible to understand what our optimized and continuous activity flow targets need to be, if we don't understand how demand flows into our value stream.</p>
			<p>As we identify and coordinate demand flows inputs, the VSM team can then analyze how to improve activity and information flows to match demand rates. Finally, we can expect customer demands to vary over time, so we need to understand how to balance production workloads to minimize bottlenecks, waiting, and other forms of waste on an ongoing basis. </p>
			<p>Since the future state phases follow the aforementioned sequence of analysis, we'll start our introduction to the three phases in the same order, starting with analyzing customer demand.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-191"><a id="_idTextAnchor237"/>Phase 1 – customer demand</h1>
			<p>This phase of the <a id="_idIndexMarker882"/>future mapping exercise is <a id="_idIndexMarker883"/>expressly set up to ensure the VSM team starts its Lean improvement objectives with the customer's needs firmly in mind. But we're not talking about understanding customer requirements in terms of features and functions, as that type of analysis lies with the product management function. In other words, work item identification, selection, and prioritization are part of the Agile product management and product backlog refinement processes in an IT context. </p>
			<p>In this phase, you need to answer the following questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What are your customers' demands for this value stream?</li>
				<li>How many customers do you have?</li>
				<li>What are the types of customers or market segments, or niches, that are supported?</li>
				<li>What is the predictability of orders, including seasonal adjustments, across all customers or types of customers by product line? </li>
				<li>Are you overproducing, underproducing, or meeting demand?</li>
				<li>Does your ability to meet your customer demand vary over time? If so, why?</li>
				<li>Can you meet your customer delivery dates with your current resources and capabilities? If not, why not?</li>
				<li>Do you need to carry buffer or safety inventories? If so, which type, why, and how many?</li>
				<li>What problems need to be solved right now? </li>
				<li>How clean and organized is your value stream's facilities and operations? If lacking, what are the negative impacts and what do we need to do to reduce clutter and disorganization?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In Lean, the focus of meeting customer demand lies in the area of fulfillment. In other words, the VSM team works to help the value stream improve its rate of deliveries. Improving the ability to meet customer demand in the future state is a multi-step process of addressing the following concerns:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Calculate Takt time.</li>
				<li>Establish pitch.</li>
				<li>Adjust buffers and inventories.</li>
				<li>Improve the working environment.</li>
				<li>Resolve immediate problems.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The VSM team <a id="_idIndexMarker884"/>starts their future state – customer demand-related analysis – by <a id="_idIndexMarker885"/>calculating the value stream's Takt time. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-192"><a id="_idTextAnchor238"/>Calculating Takt times</h2>
			<p>Understanding Takt is the <a id="_idIndexMarker886"/>first order of priority as it is a measure of how often the value stream needs to deliver its <a id="_idIndexMarker887"/>products or service to meet customer demand. We can't find out how much we need to improve our deliveries if we don't know our demand targets. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Takt time</strong> is the pace or rate at which customers demand delivery of our products or services. We calculate Takt time by dividing <em class="italic">net available operating time</em> by the <em class="italic">number of products required over time</em>. <strong class="bold">Net operating time</strong> is the <a id="_idIndexMarker888"/>work hours available over a specific period (that is, 7 hours in a shift, 14 hours of operation in a day, or 2,240 hours per month).</p>
			<p>When calculating the net operating time, make sure to reduce the total time to account for meetings, health breaks, lunch breaks, and other non-value-added activities. So, in an 8-hour shift with two 15-minute health breaks, a 30-minute lunch break, and a 15-minute Daily Scrum or standup meeting, the net operating time is 405 minutes:</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Net operating time=((8 hrs*60 min) – 15 min – 15 min – 30 min – 15 min) =&gt; 405 min</em></p>
			<p>If our daily customer demand rate is 810 units per day, our Takt time can be calculated as follows:</p>
			<p><em class="italic">405 min – 810 units/day=.5 minutes per unit</em></p>
			<p>In other words, with a Takt time of .5 minutes per unit, you need to produce two units every minute. Manufacturers of large commercial aircraft or ships don't typically have a requirement to deliver multiple times per day. However, automotive and electronic equipment manufacturers usually do. </p>
			<p>In the traditional Waterfall-based systems or the <strong class="bold">software development life cycle</strong> (<strong class="bold">SDLC</strong>) model, software <a id="_idIndexMarker889"/>development teams often released new products annually – usually initiated as time-bound projects aligned with fiscal year budgets. Unfortunately, the strategy didn't work out very well for many reasons. In contrast, modern Agile practices allow software development teams to deliver new functionality over 1 to 4 weeks.  </p>
			<p>However, even with <a id="_idIndexMarker890"/>Agile practices, software product managers may choose to release software into the <a id="_idIndexMarker891"/>production environments much less frequently. For commercial products, delivery activities may have to align with marketing and sales promotions. In a BPI context, new software enhancements affect business processes that require ancillary activities to create and deploy sysadmin support guides and training aids to go along with the software, to the operations staff and users. </p>
			<p>On the other hand, <strong class="bold">continuous integration and continuous delivery</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>) tools and practices enhance <a id="_idIndexMarker892"/>Agile practices and make it possible to deploy new software releases much more frequently. IT development shops may start by integrating software engineering tools to form integrated toolchains that help automate and accelerate flows across portions of the overall SDLC process. </p>
			<p>With increased maturity, the IT organization implements an integrated and automated toolchain that supports the flow of work and information across both the software development and operations functions. Otherwise <a id="_idIndexMarker893"/>known as <strong class="bold">DevOps pipelines</strong> or <strong class="bold">DevOps platforms</strong>, these <a id="_idIndexMarker894"/>integrated and automated tools significantly improve the speed and reliability of software delivery.  </p>
			<p>For example, a modern DevOps environment's continuous deployment capability allows new features and functionality to be released into production environments multiple times a day. Moreover, a mature DevOps pipeline allows a development team to stand up multiple test environments on demand and rapidly check functionality, system load, performance, and stress capabilities before deployment.</p>
			<p>The rapid pace of competitive <a id="_idIndexMarker895"/>change among the <a id="_idIndexMarker896"/>major online retailers, insurance companies, manufacturing firms, and healthcare providers helps justify the investments in the DevOps pipelines and platforms. As noted previously, DevOps capabilities are the table stakes that are necessary to compete in our digital economy and meet our customers' evolving demands. And Takt time sets the pace.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-193"><a id="_idTextAnchor239"/>Establishing pitch</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Pitch</strong> is the amount of <a id="_idIndexMarker897"/>time needed for a value stream to make one container of products. In an ideal world, customer <a id="_idIndexMarker898"/>orders would arrive one at a time, in lot sizes of one, at a constant rate of speed, and we'd be able to process those orders as single-piece flows at the same rate of speed. But that's seldom the case for most producers. Moreover, our supply chain partners may not be able to deliver materials and parts just to satisfy one customer order, if for no other reason, due to the fact that the cost of shipping physical products in bulk is usually cheaper. </p>
			<p>Transport costs are not a concern in software delivery when they're deployed via internet connections. But software delivery does become an issue when it's packaged as a CD ROM or as part of a physical product.</p>
			<p>For these reasons, it's challenging to match production rates to exact Takt time, and production schedulers must find ways to accommodate for these variances efficiently. That is the goal of establishing pitch – to make sure the organization can handle changes in demand in the most efficient manner.</p>
			<p>Before learning how to calculate pitch<a id="_idTextAnchor240"/>, we <a id="_idIndexMarker899"/>need to understand <strong class="bold">pack-out quantity</strong> because it's part of the pitch measurement. Pack-out quantities are the number of items a customer (internal or external) wants to be delivered together as a lot, usually moved in a container during transport.</p>
			<p>The easiest way to think about pack-out quantity is to imagine building enough parts to fill shipping cartons or shipping containers bound for a customer. If we can produce single-piece flows and ship our parts one at a time, our pack-out quantity is one. However, if we supply products to fulfill our retailers' orders, the pack-out quantities might vary by time of year, product type, and each customer's sales volume. </p>
			<p>The calculation for pitch is fairly simple, which is <em class="italic">Takt time multiplied by the pack-out quantity</em>. If, for example, our optimal pack-out volume for product <em class="italic">A</em> is 100 parts per shipment, and our Takt time of 400 releases of Product <em class="italic">A</em> per day, our pitch can be calculated as follows:</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Pitch=400 parts per day X 100 parts/ shipment = 4 shipments per day</em></p>
			<p>In other words, the value stream must ship four lots of 100 products per day.</p>
			<p>As you think <a id="_idIndexMarker900"/>about what pitch represents, it's <a id="_idIndexMarker901"/>essential to understand that Takt time is customer-driven, but pack-out quantity may or may not be. Therefore, there are several factors you must consider when considering your pitch. </p>
			<p>Customers may not choose to purchase or receive one product at a time. Some customers may request shipments of varying lot sizes, perhaps due to seasonal adjustments. Also, the organization may not have the ability to produce products most efficiently as single-piece flows yet, due to lengthy setup and changeover times and batch processes. </p>
			<p>Instead, it may be preferable to allow the value stream flows to proceed in larger lot sizes to minimize part and material changeovers. Finally, the cost of shipping is often an essential factor when determining optimal delivery lot sizes.</p>
			<p>In software delivery organizations, pack-out quantity and pitch become factors in Agile shops that release across <strong class="bold">Sprints</strong>. For example, an Agile <strong class="bold">Scrum</strong> shop evaluates their pack-out quantity as the number of user stories completed per Sprint, which is their pitch. </p>
			<p>Many IT organizations have infrastructure constraints that may limit the number of testing servers they can stand up in parallel. In those cases, the pack-out quantity is the number of parallel tests they can run, and their pitch is the duration of the testing activity. </p>
			<p>Finally, customers <a id="_idIndexMarker902"/>may not be willing to receive new features one at a time <a id="_idIndexMarker903"/>in production, especially when those features impact business processes and the need to inform and train staff. Each release has a pack-out quantity of features in this context, and the pitch is the period between releases.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-194"><a id="_idTextAnchor241"/>Understanding production controls</h2>
			<p>When organizations must <a id="_idIndexMarker904"/>process work items in <a id="_idIndexMarker905"/>larger lot sizes, the schedulers should implement a <strong class="bold">production control</strong> mechanism. Examples <a id="_idIndexMarker906"/>include <strong class="bold">Kanban bins</strong> or <strong class="bold">Heijunka boxes</strong> to level the <a id="_idIndexMarker907"/>flow of work items by volume and the types of work items that are produced. </p>
			<p>The value stream operators still pull work items into their workstations. But they pull the entire lot, not just one part. For example, in manufacturing, the parts might come in a bin, and the operators complete their work at a piece rate that the design of their specific activity allows. Then once the bin has been refilled, the next operator in line can pull the entire lot into their workstation when they have available capacity.</p>
			<p>In software delivery value streams, the <a id="_idIndexMarker908"/>software engineers pull the work items from the <strong class="bold">Sprint Backlogs</strong> and complete their work to implement and test the related user story's functionality. In effect, Sprint Backlogs serve as types of Heijunka boxes to manage the flow of a collection of user stories that flow together through the development and test activities. </p>
			<p>The following diagram shows a Sprint Backlog portrayed as a container for the user stories undergoing development within an upcoming Sprint:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer083" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_09_01.jpg" alt="Figure 9.1 – Sprint Backlog as a type of Heijunka box&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.1 – Sprint Backlog as a type of Heijunka box</p>
			<p>The team has selected the six highest priority items for the upcoming 2-week Sprint. However, the product owner releases an average of 20 new requirements into the product backlog every 4 weeks. Due to this, you need to manage your development team's ability to support your customer's demand.</p>
			<p>Let's assume that the development team members, after breaks and meetings, work 7 hours per day for a total of 140 net operating hours per 4-week month, or 70 hours throughout a 2-week Sprint. Therefore, no matter which duration you choose, your Takt time will be 7 hours per work item. In other words, a new work item comes into our IT value stream, on average, every 7 hours.</p>
			<p>Since the development team selected six items for their Sprint Backlog, the pitch for this lot size is the <em class="italic">Takt time multiplied by the number of items selected for the Sprint</em>, or 42 hours. In other words, the development team must initiate a new lot of six work items within 42 hours to match the Takt time delivery rates.</p>
			<p>Since there are 70 net operating hours <a id="_idIndexMarker909"/>available in every 2-week Sprint duration, it's tempting to think that you should <a id="_idIndexMarker910"/>have no problems meeting the demand. But hold on –  the VSM team's work is not done yet. For one, we need to evaluate the pitch in terms of how long it takes to process a lot of six work items across the entire value stream. </p>
			<p>If we had a proper automated and continuous flow across our IT value stream, we may not be concerned about this. However, under Scrum-based Agile practices, the development team can only work on those six items over the next 2 weeks.</p>
			<p>Review the metrics displayed in the current value stream map shown in the preceding diagram, and the metrics tables in <a href="B17087_08_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor209"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a><em class="italic">, Identifying Lean Metrics  (VSM Step 5)</em>, in <em class="italic">Figure 8.1</em> (<em class="italic">Table of total lead time, total value-added, and rolling C/A</em>) and <em class="italic">Figure 8.2</em> (<em class="italic">Table of Lean metrics across an IT value stream</em>). We <a id="_idIndexMarker911"/>know the <strong class="bold">total lead time</strong> (<strong class="bold">TLT</strong>) across the entire IT value stream is 328 hours, which is a little more than 8 weeks in duration. Most of the time is spent waiting in the product backlog queue or waiting on a new release as a feature. </p>
			<p>On the positive side, our <strong class="bold">total value-added time</strong> (<strong class="bold">TVT</strong>) time is 57 hours <a id="_idIndexMarker912"/>across the entire IT value stream, which is well within the 72 net operating hours available within a Sprint. On the negative side, there are 80 hours of lead time in the development-related activities and another 80 hours of lead time in the release-related activities.</p>
			<p>The VSM team has some work to do to resolves issues related to waiting and mismatched cycle times. For example, the work items may end up queuing again at testing if the infrastructure is not set up to handle testing on demand in single-piece flows. Similarly, the tested software work items, now available as tested features, may sit yet again in a queue, waiting to be released to the customer's production environment.</p>
			<p>In Agile environments, product releases into production may occur with every Sprint, but they are more often released in less frequent and formalized product releases. The formalized releases give us time to implement marketing promotions and sales campaigns for commercial deliveries, and socialization and training when software deliveries impact critical business processes. </p>
			<p>Waiting is a major <a id="_idIndexMarker913"/>problem in the <a id="_idIndexMarker914"/>sample IT software delivery value stream. Since we've already noted that queues sometimes become necessary or unavoidable, let's discuss how to manage them.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-195"><a id="_idTextAnchor242"/>Managing buffers and safety inventories</h2>
			<p>So far, you've learned <a id="_idIndexMarker915"/>how to use Takt time and pitch to manage flows to meet customer demand. But we also <a id="_idIndexMarker916"/>need to manage our buffers and safety inventories to ensure there's always <strong class="bold">work in progress</strong> (<strong class="bold">WIP</strong>) to <a id="_idIndexMarker917"/>support our customers' needs. However, we cannot have so <a id="_idIndexMarker918"/>much inventory that we introduce problems artificially, creating product delays and increasing our carrying costs. We <a id="_idIndexMarker919"/>already know that <strong class="bold">WIP</strong> waiting is a problem in the sample IT value stream, so let's start there.</p>
			<h3>Eliminating work in progress queues</h3>
			<p>Before we go any further, it's essential <a id="_idIndexMarker920"/>to understand <a id="_idIndexMarker921"/>the need to eliminate all <strong class="bold">work-in-process buffers</strong> of work items and materials. WIP queues simply hide problems and don't, in any way to help improve flows. WIP queues are merely mechanisms to hide problems with flow. The only inventories Lean allows is for carrying finished goods, but even then, within strict limits. </p>
			<p>It's also important <a id="_idIndexMarker922"/>not to confuse the concept of inventories with the processing work items in lots, as described in the previous section on establishing pitch. The word inventory connotes <a id="_idIndexMarker923"/>the total number of materials, work items, or products contained within our value stream pipelines, or in sections of our value stream pipelines. In contrast, a lot size is a mechanism that's used to flow some number of work items (materials or products) together through the value stream to improve flows. </p>
			<p>For example, when a software development team selects a list of work items from the Product Backlog, the resulting Sprint Backlog is, in effect, a lot size that the team judges most appropriate for completion during the upcoming Sprint.</p>
			<h3>Flowing work items in Sprint Backlogs</h3>
			<p>In the short run, until <a id="_idIndexMarker924"/>we can achieve single-piece flows, it may be more efficient to flow work items in larger lot sizes. This <a id="_idIndexMarker925"/>limitation is due to <a id="_idIndexMarker926"/>uneven flow rates across value stream activities with mismatched cycles, setup times, and batch processes. </p>
			<p>Such is the case in our IT value stream example. We gain productivity improvements by implementing Agile practices for iterative and incremental development while minimizing WIP lot sizes of work items via the Sprint Backlogs. Effectively, this is the purpose of Sprint backlogs in IT-related value streams: to control product development flows in manageable bites. But flowing work items in lots is not the same as allowing those work in progress items to queue and wait between activities. </p>
			<p>In an Agile environment, a common approach is to select a "lot" of work items from the product backlog for an upcoming Sprint, and then manage the flow across the Sprint using a Kanban Board. Later, when the IT shop implements a mature CI/CD or DevOps Pipeline – to streamline, integrate, and automate their SDLC processes – the IT value stream can implement single-piece flows against work items queued in the product backlog. </p>
			<h3>Managing flows with Kanban Boards</h3>
			<p>Another strategy is to <a id="_idIndexMarker927"/>eliminate Agile-based Sprints altogether and instead move to a pure <strong class="bold">Kanban-oriented</strong> production control strategy. In a Kanban system, the development team <a id="_idIndexMarker928"/>members pull refined and prioritized <a id="_idIndexMarker929"/>work items directly from the product backlog. The team members work on each item from start to finish across the development pipeline. </p>
			<p>It takes a reasonably mature CI/CD capability to implement a Kanban-oriented IT production control strategy effectively. Without integration and automation of SDLC activities, the team spends a great deal of their time on non-value-added work associated with setting up and configuring development, testing environments, and waiting on test results. </p>
			<p>In a proper Kanban system, all work items in the Sprint Backlog must flow through the <strong class="bold">SDLC</strong> before <a id="_idIndexMarker930"/>the Agile/Scrum team takes on new work. In other words, Kanban and Agile practices do not eliminate the traditional SDLC activities of coding, building, integrating, merging code, configuring, provisioning development and test environments, performing unit, integration, system, and a host of other critical tests.  </p>
			<p>But these activities are performed more frequently to accommodate the production of smaller increments of new functionality across each iterative development cycle. <strong class="bold">Integration</strong> and <strong class="bold">automation</strong> improve flow and help eliminate waste across an SDLC, and value stream management helps prioritize and drive those IT value stream improvements.</p>
			<p>The following image shows the Kanban production control strategy implemented within an IT value stream. Note that the Kanban Board does not reference specific SDLC tasks in the development pipeline. Instead, these activities are all encapsulated within the <strong class="bold">In Progress</strong> and <strong class="bold">Verify</strong> phases of the Kanban-oriented product workflow:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer084" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_09_02.jpg" alt="Figure 9.2 – Kanban Board for an IT value stream&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.2 – Kanban Board for an IT value stream</p>
			<p>In the meantime, the <strong class="bold">pull-oriented production control strategy</strong> of Kanban prevents the Scrum team from taking on new work until they've finished the user stories in the Sprint Backlog. </p>
			<p>The only recourse is <a id="_idIndexMarker931"/>for the Scrum team <a id="_idIndexMarker932"/>to split the user stories <a id="_idIndexMarker933"/>across team members and work each user story from front to end across all relevant SDLC activities, up through the system, including load, stress, and performance testing. If they occur at all, those types of testing activities tend to be run in batches, just before the product is released into the production environments. </p>
			<h3>Improving flows with CI/CD pipelines</h3>
			<p>Unfortunately, pushing testing <a id="_idIndexMarker934"/>to just before <a id="_idIndexMarker935"/>the product's release <a id="_idIndexMarker936"/>brings up problems associated with batch processing. Any defects or bugs hiding in the code will be found when the IT department is planning to release the software product, which will push back the release date. Moreover, the integrated code's complexity at that late stage makes it difficult to isolate and debug the offending code, APIs/ web services, queries, security, computing, or network-related problems. </p>
			<p>In short, Kanban and Scrum are <a id="_idIndexMarker937"/>inconsistent practices unless the development team has a mature CI/CD pipeline. With CI/ CD capabilities, the development team can work on each user story and feature <a id="_idIndexMarker938"/>individually from end-to-end without delays. At that point, the team needs to evaluate the length of their Sprints and how <a id="_idIndexMarker939"/>many work items they want to queue in a Sprint Backlog. Remember, your goal in Lean is to achieve single-piece flows ultimately. The same goal is valid for Lean-Agile practices.</p>
			<p>Now that you know that it is not a Lean practice to allow WIP queues, let's look at where allowing queues and waiting does make sense. </p>
			<h3>Allowing finished goods inventories</h3>
			<p>In Lean, there are two types of inventories to <a id="_idIndexMarker940"/>manage within our value stream: <strong class="bold">buffer inventories</strong> and <strong class="bold">safety stocks</strong>. Both are <a id="_idIndexMarker941"/>examples of finished <a id="_idIndexMarker942"/>goods inventories. The term finished goods <a id="_idIndexMarker943"/>simply means that the products have completed development and passed QA/testing but are being held for some reason prior to sale.</p>
			<p>In software development, the release of software components and products can be delayed (stored) after meeting their acceptance criteria for the Definition of Done, and the products are technically ready to be shipped to a customer, a retail or app store, or installed within a production environment. A primary reason for making such delays is to make sure other elements of the delivery are in place. </p>
			<p>For example, software products may go out as part of the release in a physical product or be delayed as part of a larger release of capabilities. Software deliveries may also be delayed so that they coincide with marketing and sales promotions, or with the deployment of new business processes. </p>
			<p><em class="italic">Buffer inventories</em> are extra stocks of finished products that the organization carries to meet customer demand when customer demand rates change; that is, changes in Takt time. In contrast, <em class="italic">safety stocks</em> are inventories of finished goods that are used to meet ongoing customer demand when the value stream's flow is disrupted, such as equipment failures, power outages, labor issues, and unexpected quality issues. Buffer inventories and safety stocks are stored and independently managed as they serve two distinctly different purposes.</p>
			<p>However, it's also important to understand that the concept of <em class="italic">finished goods</em> does not merely include the completed work items that are produced by your value stream. Finished goods can also include materials and parts that have been procured from your supply chain vendors. It may make sense to carry some of these types of inventories to prevent the starvation of your value stream if your value stream partners, or their transport or distribution services, run into delivery problems.</p>
			<p>These concepts are particularly relevant when your software products are embedded in physical products, such as control systems in manufacturing equipment and automobiles, or to support IoT-based value delivery capabilities. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Internet of Things (IoT)</p>
			<p class="callout">IoT is a <a id="_idIndexMarker944"/>term that describes a network of physical objects that have embedded sensors, software, and other technologies that enable internet-based connections and data to be exchanged with other connected servers, devices, and information systems. Moreover, IoT capabilities allow us to deliver product feature enhancements, such as updating the navigation systems in automobiles, trucks, aircraft, ships, and other transport systems.</p>
			<p>With software products powering so many of our modern-day products and services, organizations must carefully manage inventories of work items (that is, software, hardware, and other physical products and components). However, organizations must also manage their resources across all organizational value streams to support variations in customer demand.</p>
			<h3>Managing buffer and safety resources</h3>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker945"/>inventories <a id="_idIndexMarker946"/>concept is not <a id="_idIndexMarker947"/>limited to merely <a id="_idIndexMarker948"/>managing stores of parts, materials, and completed work items. The value stream may require buffer and safety resources to ramp up production in periods of high demand or when our value stream operators call in sick. Buffer and safety resources include the use of overtime hours, hiring temporary workers or retirees, or borrowing staff from other departments. </p>
			<p>Similarly, we may need to install excess capacity in equipment or tools to manage flows across varying customer demand loads, or to make up for lost time when the value stream unexpectedly shuts down for whatever reason. It's also possible to hand off excess work to other <a id="_idIndexMarker949"/>value streams or partners or contractors with <a id="_idIndexMarker950"/>excess equipment and human resource capacities. In the <a id="_idIndexMarker951"/>latter situations, the organization must take <a id="_idIndexMarker952"/>proactive steps to ensure the partners/contractors can deliver equivalent quality and costs.</p>
			<h3>Employing finished goods supermarkets</h3>
			<p>Inventories help <a id="_idIndexMarker953"/>maintain flow with disruptions in demand and availability of parts, materials, and products. But <a id="_idIndexMarker954"/>we can also use inventories to help enforce our pull-oriented production control strategies. Inventories that are used for this purpose are called <strong class="bold">finished goods supermarkets</strong>. </p>
			<p>The idea here is that products are pulled on demand from finished goods inventories to fulfill customer orders, and the value streams quickly replenish those items. Conceptually, finished goods supermarkets operate in much the same way your local grocery stores operate. Customers pull products off the grocery store shelves, and stocking clerks replenish those inventories from their finished goods buffer stores. </p>
			<p>Supermarkets work across value streams and value delivery chains. Customers pull products from the organization's finished goods inventories, even if the physical pull process involves the shipping department and freight company. The value streams replenish the finished goods inventories following the production and operations flows upstream. Similarly, supply chain partners replenish component materials and parts as the delivery organization's value streams pull them. </p>
			<p>Supermarkets are the essence of JIT production concepts. Customers trigger the flow of work, information, and materials as the most downstream activity. All other preceding (that is, upstream) value stream and value chain activities replenish their value-adding work in a synchronized fashion and JIT to meet the next customer's demands.</p>
			<p>The closest equivalent to carrying finished goods occurs when we accumulate features prior to a release in an IT context. But the purpose of having software finished goods inventories is not that different, as the goal is still to have products ready for release when the customers are ready to accept them.</p>
			<p>By now, your VSM team has calculated Takt times for all the product lines and customers, and they <a id="_idIndexMarker955"/>have established a <a id="_idIndexMarker956"/>pitch or set of pitches to improve flows in line with customer delivery demands. You can also make improvements to your work environment to help the value stream meet customer demand.  </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-196"><a id="_idTextAnchor243"/>Improving the work environment</h2>
			<p>Lean organizations use <strong class="bold">the 5S system</strong> to <a id="_idIndexMarker957"/>improve their work environments. We don't need to spend much time <a id="_idTextAnchor244"/>discussing this topic since we introduced how it improves workspaces in <a href="B17087_06_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a><em class="italic">, Launching the VSM Initiative (VSM Steps 1-3)</em>. The 5S system's objective is to <a id="_idIndexMarker958"/>create a functional and clean environment that improves the work environment's efficiency, effectiveness, and safety.</p>
			<p>An essential element of the 5S system is that it provides an ongoing mechanism to observe and address disorder and clutter issues that can impede flow, cause delays, and otherwise hide problems. In Lean, we always view problems in terms of the seven forms of waste: transportation, inventory, motion, waiting, overprocessing, overproduction, and defects. Recall that the seven wastes of Lean were introduced in <a href="B17087_06_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a><em class="italic">, Launching the VSM Initiative – The Seven Deadly Wastes</em>. </p>
			<p>As a quick review, the following table provides a list of the 5S system and <strong class="bold">areas for potential waste</strong> methods, as well as the seven wastes of Lean:</p>
			<div>

			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.3 – Methods of the 5S system and areas of potential waste</p>
			<p>The 5S system is <a id="_idIndexMarker959"/>listed numerically as these activities' execution tends to follow this sequence. The types and extent of <a id="_idIndexMarker960"/>the wastes of Lean will vary across organizations and across every value stream. We attack wastes in the order they impact our ability to deliver value, from highest to lowest. The main point to be made here is that the 5S system helps the VSM team, VS operators, and other stakeholders eliminate any waste that hinders Lean production processes. If you need a further review of the 5S technique, please refer to <a href="B17087_06_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Launching the VSM Initiative (VSM Steps 1-3)</em>.</p>
			<p>Now, let's move on to the last area of work necessary to evaluate how to improve our ability to meet customer demand. In the next section, you will learn how to employ problem solving methods to improve value stream performance so that you can meet customer demand.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-197"><a id="_idTextAnchor245"/>Resolving demand-related problems</h2>
			<p>Since customer demand <a id="_idIndexMarker961"/>often vary over time, both in <a id="_idIndexMarker962"/>terms of volume and product needs, demand-related issues are a continual problem that value stream operators and managers must address. From the customer's perspective, demand-related issues arise when it's difficult to place an order, or they can't get the features and functions they want, the quality is unacceptable, or delivery dates extend beyond their desire to wait. </p>
			<p>There are many <a id="_idIndexMarker963"/>problem-solving <a id="_idIndexMarker964"/>models that the VSM team can use to address their customer demand issues. One that I like was published by the <em class="italic">Iowa University Human Resources Department</em>. Let's take a look at it.</p>
			<p>The following is the<strong class="bold"> 8-Step Problem Solving Process</strong>:</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Step 1 – define the problem</strong></p>
			<p>To understand this method, you must think about the following questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What is the problem?</li>
				<li>How did you discover the problem?</li>
				<li>When did the problem start, and how long has this problem been going on for?</li>
				<li>Is there enough data to contain the problem and prevent it from getting passed to the next process step? If yes, contain the problem.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong class="bold">Step 2 – clarify the problem</strong></p>
			<p>Before attempting to solve a problem, we need to make sure we truly understand the scope of the problem. We can avoid this problem by asking the following questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What data is available or needed to help clarify or fully understand the problem?</li>
				<li>Is it a top priority to resolve the problem at this point?</li>
				<li>Are additional resources required to clarify the problem? If yes, elevate the problem to your leader to help locate the right resources and form a team. </li>
				<li> Consider a Lean event (Do-it, Burst, RPI, or Project).</li>
				<li>Ensure the problem is contained and does not get passed to the next process step.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong class="bold">Step 3 – define the goals</strong></p>
			<p>In software development, we always want to know what capabilities a new feature or function must deliver to meet our customers' needs. In Agile, we call this our <strong class="bold">Definition of Done</strong>. The same concept applies here in resolving demand-related problems. We need to define goals that define the desired state for the future state's improvement:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What is your end goal or desired future state?</li>
				<li>What will you accomplish if you fix this problem?</li>
				<li>What is the desired timeline for solving this problem?</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong class="bold">Step 4 – identify the root cause of the problem</strong></p>
			<p>We mustn't focus on the symptoms and fail to fix the root cause of whatever problems <a id="_idIndexMarker965"/>we need to resolve. Having a <a id="_idIndexMarker966"/>focus on resolving symptoms is like taking aspirin for a headache – it provides temporary relief, only for the headache return because we haven't addressed its root cause. The following list provides a strategy for finding the root causes of customer demand-related problems:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify possible causes of the problem.</li>
				<li>Prioritize possible root causes of the problem.</li>
				<li>What information or data is there to validate the root cause?</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong class="bold">Step 5 – develop an action plan</strong></p>
			<p>Often, customer demand-related issues are complex and require a host of activities and people to address properly. In such cases, the VSM team should create an action plan that defines the required activities, time frames, and roles and responsibilities, as shown in the following list:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Generate a list of actions required to address the root cause and prevent recurring problems</li>
				<li>Assign an owner and timeline to each action.</li>
				<li>Status actions to ensure completion.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong class="bold">Step 6 – execute the action plan</strong></p>
			<p>Of course, creating a plan of action is not the same thing as executing a plan of action. Someone needs to be responsible for ensuring the work is completed to satisfaction. Consistent with Lean and Agile practices, the <strong class="bold">value stream mapping</strong> (<strong class="bold">VSM</strong>) team may <a id="_idIndexMarker967"/>review progress and results, but someone needs to track and guide the effort, as noted in the following list:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Implement an action plan to address the root cause.</li>
				<li>Maintain and display a visible chart of progress. </li>
				<li>Verify the completion of all action items.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong class="bold">Step 7 – evaluate the results</strong></p>
			<p>This step validates the attainment of the goals listed in step 3 and captures lessons learned for the actions. First, we need to ensure we achieved our action item goals before leaving an activity. But we also don't want to reinvent the wheel, if we <a id="_idIndexMarker968"/>have already <a id="_idIndexMarker969"/>performed similar discovery and analysis work in the past. In fact, we may already have a solution to our current problems if we paid attention and maintained accurate historical records. The following list includes activities for evaluating our findings and results:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Monitor and collect data.</li>
				<li>Did you meet the goals you defined in step 3? If not, repeat the 8-step process. </li>
				<li>Were there any unforeseen consequences?</li>
				<li>If the problem has been resolved, remove activities that were added previously to contain the problem.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong class="bold">Step 8 – Continuously improve</strong></p>
			<p>This last step helps catch and address any loose ends. For example, do we have sufficient data to address and resolve the customer demand problem fully? Can we do better? If so, how can we do better? Step 8 involves the following activities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Look for additional opportunities to implement a better solution.</li>
				<li>Ensure the problem cannot come back, and communicate lessons learned.</li>
				<li>If needed, repeat the 8-step <a id="_idIndexMarker970"/>problem-solving process to drive further improvements.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-198"><a id="_idTextAnchor246"/>Mapping the customer-demand map </h2>
			<p>We now have <a id="_idIndexMarker972"/>enough information to develop a <strong class="bold">future state map</strong> that will address our improvement ideas for improving our ability to meet our customers' demands. The future state map for the demand phase uses the same VA mapping symbols, but the mapping process is different. The following list describes the sequence of steps necessary to support drawing the future state's demand phase map:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Start the new future state customer demand map on a whiteboard, poster board, or electronic system while using the VSM Storyboard as a guide.</li>
				<li>Start by drawing the customers and suppliers (if they're different from the customer) at the top of the board.</li>
				<li>Record the customer requirements and demand fulfillment requirements in terms of Takt time and pitch.</li>
				<li>Place the last activity (that is, the most downstream activity) toward the drawing area's far-right edge.</li>
				<li>On the board's left-hand side, draw the upstream process that initiates the customer request or demand.</li>
				<li>Draw a manual or electronic communications link between the customer and supplier.</li>
				<li>Draw the buffer and safety inventories with the appropriate VA symbols. </li>
				<li>Draw where the value stream operators need to implement their 5S systems for improvement. Use the Kaizen Burst icon, which represents an improvement activity.</li>
				<li>Determine where problem-solving projects need to be implemented. (Use the Kaizen Burst icon for this.)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker973"/>diagram shows the future state's map of customer demand phase improvements, which might look like your future state IT value stream:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer086" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_09_04.jpg" alt="Figure 9.4 – IT value stream future state map – demand phase&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.4 – IT value stream future state map – demand phase</p>
			<p>The numbers on the future state map indicate the mapping steps noted in the previous list. In our example, the VSM team has decided that there are three critical areas they must focus on to improve the IT value stream's ability to respond to customer demand. The first planned Kaizen Burst uses the 5S system to discover low-hanging fruit that can improve flow and eliminate wastes. The second improvement activity is to help guide the development team's integration efforts on the software development and testing tools they have to <a id="_idIndexMarker974"/>implement more effective CI/CD toolchains. The final Kaizen Burst they have planned is to use problem-solving techniques to help the development team implement a Kanban system. This strategy enables a more rapid response to incoming requests.</p>
			<p>This section completes our discussion on future state customer demand mapping. Before moving on to the future state customer flow phase, let's review the tools that are used in the demand phase of future state mapping. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-199"><a id="_idTextAnchor247"/>Future state – customer demand tools</h2>
			<p>The tools that are used in this <a id="_idIndexMarker975"/>phase of future state mapping help the VSM team improve the value stream's responses to <a id="_idIndexMarker976"/>variations in customer demand. We started by calculating <em class="italic">Takt time</em> across customers and products, and across variations of holiday or other seasonal adjustments, as required. </p>
			<p>Next, the VSM team established <em class="italic">pitch</em> for the value stream, which calculates the Takt time times the number of work units. Pitch's objective is to determine the most appropriate lot sizes to move work items through our value stream. </p>
			<p>Next, you learned how to incorporate <em class="italic">buffer inventories and safety stocks</em> of finished goods and resources to ensure fluctuations in demand and flow don't starve your value stream, and prevent them from doing value-added work. You also learned how to employ finished goods supermarkets to enforce the pull-oriented production control strategies across your value stream, and even across your value delivery chains.</p>
			<p>Another essential tool for improving the value stream's response to variations in customer demand is the <em class="italic">5S system</em>. The value stream operators use the 5S system to remove clutter, organize work areas to improve the flow of work and efficiencies, and generally improve the operators' health and safety. In addition, the 5S system helps the value stream team evaluate and eliminate the sources of waste. </p>
			<p>In this phase, the VSM team starts to assess the problems that hinder the value stream's response to varying customer demand and analyze each problem's cause and effects. In this section, you learned how to employ the <em class="italic">8-step problem-solving process</em> to resolve demand-related problems.</p>
			<p>Finally, you began developing your <em class="italic">future state map</em> to visually display the desired changes to the value stream, as well as updated your data on Takt time and pitch. The VSM team draws the future state map on a large whiteboard or poster board, or any electronic tool that's displayed on a large screen. Ideally, the VSM team should use the VSM Storyboard format (shown in <em class="italic">Appendix B</em>) to keep all their critical information in one place.</p>
			<p>This section <a id="_idIndexMarker977"/>concludes our discussion on <a id="_idIndexMarker978"/>mapping the future state to make improvements to meet customer demand. Next, we'll learn how to develop the future state so that we can analyze and display improvements in order to implement and sustain continuous flows across the value stream. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-200"><a id="_idTextAnchor248"/>Phase 2 – continuous flow</h1>
			<p>Now that the VSM team has addressed issues of <a id="_idIndexMarker979"/>customer demand, they can start figuring out how to improve production flows to <a id="_idIndexMarker980"/>meet our customers' demands. In this section, we will continue our future state mapping activities and address issues related to establishing and maintaining Lean continuous flows.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Continuous flow</strong> is a Lean strategy that's used to achieve the ideal goal of moving a single work item through every step of your value stream activities instead of grouping and moving <em class="italic">lots</em> of work items collectively as batches (also known as <strong class="bold">Make One</strong>, <strong class="bold">Move One</strong>; <strong class="bold">One-Piece Flows</strong>; <strong class="bold">Single-Piece Flows</strong>). The objective is to produce and move one work item at a time, or at least the smallest practical number of items, through a series of value stream activities as continuously as possible. As part of a pull-based production control strategy, each activity produces only what is necessary to fulfill the next activity's request. </p>
			<p>What establishes Lean continuous flows is the value stream's mechanism to ensure its internal and external customers receive the right work unit, at the right time, and in the right quantities. It's not uncommon to focus our efforts initially on improving individual work activities, apart from the other activities in our value stream system. Inevitably, that type of limited focus leads to problems with the overall flow of work. Instead, we need to <a id="_idIndexMarker981"/>take a systems-thinking <a id="_idIndexMarker982"/>view to our value stream.</p>
			<p>In this section, you will learn various ways to improve continuous flows across your value streams.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-201"><a id="_idTextAnchor249"/>Evaluating the value stream as a complex system</h2>
			<p>Organizations focus on <a id="_idIndexMarker983"/>individual activity improvements because the improvement efforts are handed over to subject matter experts or engineers with deep skills in the activity. And to <a id="_idIndexMarker984"/>some degree, those skills are needed to improve the activities. But it's impossible to calculate throughput for a given activity and understand its impact on the system as a whole – recall our previous discussions in <a href="B17087_03_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>,<em class="italic"> Analyzing Complex System Interactions</em>.</p>
			<p>Instead of looking at each activity independently, we need to take a system view of our value streams to understand and control the mechanisms that impede the flow of work, materials, and information across the value stream. Across the value stream activities, variances in customer orders, cycle times, batch or lot sizes, setup times, and part changeover times all impede continuous flows.   </p>
			<p>The VSM team must look at the value stream as a complex system of integrated parts to work through these issues. Their job is to determine how to control the flow of work across the value stream in the most efficient manner. They must evaluate mechanisms to level the flow of work so that increased demands don't bog the system down, and periods of low demands don't starve the system.  </p>
			<p>They also need to work with the value stream operators to implement standardized work processes. This helps eliminate variances that impede flow and reduce productivity and consistency of quality. In many cases, the VSM team needs to design more efficient facility and workstation layouts and obtain funding and approvals from executive management to make the desired changes.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-202"><a id="_idTextAnchor250"/>Applying the concepts of continuous flow</h2>
			<p>At a conceptual level, the ideal state of a <a id="_idIndexMarker985"/>continuous flow is replenishing a single work item every time a customer pulls another <a id="_idIndexMarker986"/>work item from our finished goods inventory. As shown in the following diagram, this concept is sometimes referred to as <em class="italic">Make One, Move One</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer087" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_09_05.jpg" alt="Figure 9.5 – Continuous flow – &quot;Make One, Move One&quot;&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.5 – Continuous flow – "Make One, Move One"</p>
			<p>Value streams synchronize work in progress across multiple activities to continue the replenishment activities, as shown in the preceding diagram. In other words, the replenishment process must continue across all upstream activities in a coordinated and synchronized fashion. </p>
			<p>The preceding diagram uses the curved <em class="italic">physical pull</em> arrow instead of the straight <em class="italic">push</em> arrows to indicate that this value stream uses a pull-oriented production control system. The pull-oriented production scheduling methods control how upstream activities are coordinated to achieve both synchronized and continuous flows. </p>
			<p>The speed of the continuous flow is a separate matter. So long as everything flows together, it doesn't matter if the flow rate is once every 5 minutes or once every 5 hours. It also doesn't matter if one part flows across each activity or if 10 parts flow together as a single lot. If the flows of parts and materials are synchronized and they can move together at the same rate, you have a continuous flow.</p>
			<p>In the future state for continuous flow, we most care about improving the value stream's overall efficiency in terms of increased throughput and fewer bottlenecks (that is, eliminating mismatched production rates, queuing of work items, and waiting). Therefore, improvements to flow always come from eliminating waste in all its forms.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-203"><a id="_idTextAnchor251"/>Evaluating the impediments of flow</h2>
			<p>Most VSM teams <a id="_idIndexMarker987"/>cannot expect to make sweeping changes in one fell swoop. That was the original goal of <strong class="bold">business process reengineering</strong> (<strong class="bold">BPR</strong>). But <a id="_idIndexMarker988"/>few organizations can afford the <a id="_idIndexMarker989"/>investments and disruptions associated with making radical changes all at once. Instead, most companies gain better results by making incremental changes with priorities based on cost-benefit assessments of identified improvement opportunities.  </p>
			<p>It is possible to implement radical change all at once through a future state value stream improvement initiative, but it's not recommended for the same reasons BPR fell out of favor. Unless the organization faces a <strong class="bold">burning platform</strong> situation to stay in business, the better alternative is to make improvement changes incrementally. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Fact</p>
			<p class="callout">The term <em class="italic">Burning Platform</em> comes from a real-life story of a horrible situation that occurred on July 6, 1988, on <a id="_idIndexMarker990"/>the <strong class="bold">Piper Alpha</strong> oil rig in the North Sea. The oil platform exploded and caused a massive fire that claimed 167 lives. However, three men, who initially locked themselves in a room away from the fire, eventually made their way outside, where they were faced with a choice of jumping into the frigid waters or perishing in flames. Two of the men jumped and, though seriously injured, managed to survive and were rescued. Unfortunately, the third man, who stayed on the burning didn't make it. </p>
			<p>In such cases, the VSM team evaluates the most impactful opportunities to eliminate waste and implementation costs and prioritize the change initiatives accordingly. Following <em class="italic">Pareto's Principle</em>, those change initiatives that offer the most significant improvements to flow and return on investment should always have the highest implementation priorities. </p>
			<p>The VSM team evaluates the flows across the value stream by working their way through a series of questions, as follows:  </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Which value stream activities, equipment, and systems need to be linked to obtain a synchronized and continuous flow?</li>
				<li>Can the existing value stream activities support a single-piece flow?</li>
				<li>If not, what is the optimum lot size until we can optimize flows better?</li>
				<li>Which work cells or activities act as bottlenecks, and why? (That is, lengthy cycle, setup and changeover times, batch processes, excessive movement, or travel times.)</li>
				<li>What is the order of priority in addressing identified bottlenecks?</li>
				<li>What can we do in the work cells or activities causing bottlenecks? </li>
				<li>What can we do to reduce the delays causing bottlenecks?</li>
				<li>How can we improve our facility's layout to improve workflows?</li>
				<li>How can <a id="_idIndexMarker991"/>we improve our <a id="_idIndexMarker992"/>information systems to improve information flow?</li>
				<li>What actions can we take to improve material flows internally?</li>
				<li>What process and contract changes must be made with our supply chain partners to align better incoming materials and parts with our customers' demands?</li>
				<li>How can we control upstream work so that it matches and synchronizes with downstream demands?</li>
				<li>Can we employ a Kanban system, and what changes are required to support the Kanban system?</li>
				<li>Should the <a id="_idIndexMarker993"/>value stream employ a <strong class="bold">first-in, first-out</strong> (<strong class="bold">FIFO</strong>) production control strategy?</li>
				<li>If any, do we need to place in-process supermarkets and buffer and safety stock inventories to address variations in customer demand or lengthy supplier lead times?</li>
				<li>What other issues impact our ability to support continuous flows?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The questions in the previous list guide the VSM team, VS operators, and other stakeholders through a process of discovery to find the impediments of continuous flow across the value stream. Each impediment leads to an improvement opportunity that is noted as a Kaizen Burst on the future state map. Much like the process associated with Product backlog refinement, the VSM team refines the list of improvement activities to define and prioritize the work tasks necessary to make the improvements to flows. </p>
			<p>Note that the <a id="_idIndexMarker994"/>preceding list <a id="_idIndexMarker995"/>includes three production control strategies (that is, Kanban, FIFO, and supermarkets) that can help sustain continuous flows across our value streams. Let's take a moment to review them in this context. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-204"><a id="_idTextAnchor252"/>Implementing production control strategies</h2>
			<p>Our value stream's workflow <a id="_idIndexMarker996"/>control strategies must support continuous flows. We introduced three workflow <a id="_idIndexMarker997"/>control approaches in the previous sections, and the VSM team may elect to include all three strategies within a single value stream. These workflow strategies are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Supermarket</strong>: This is a pull-based workflow strategy that helps enforce JIT rules by allowing downstream customers to pull items from a limited work item buffer. Upstream activities replenish those inventories as the stores fall below their defined lower limits. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Kanban Boards or other control mechanisms prevent operators from pushing work into downstream activities in software development scenarios. Instead, the Lean-Agile teams pull work into their workstation from the Sprint or Product Backlog, but only when they have completed their previous work and have capacity to take on new work items. </p>
			<p>In CI/CD and DevOps pipelines, integrating and automating toolchains links the activities to improve flow rates and implements pull-oriented production control orchestrations to minimize WIP. </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">FIFO</strong>: This enforces a <a id="_idIndexMarker998"/>rule where the first item in a queue always has the highest work priority in the order of work. The FIFO workflow strategy is useful when delays can cause problems with a work item's quality deteriorating or unique customer orders not being fulfilled. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kanban</strong>: This implements a <a id="_idIndexMarker999"/>pure pull-oriented workflow that uses signals to indicate work requirements across value stream activities. These signals are in the form of instructions displayed on cards, sticky notes, signs, electronic signals, or folders. These work items can flow independently or in lots, and they are usually stored and pulled from a storage bin that moves with the lot. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Kanban signals tell <a id="_idIndexMarker1000"/>each downstream activity what to produce and how many. In a manufacturing value stream, the <a id="_idIndexMarker1001"/>Kanban Card may include any or all of the following information:</p>
			<ul>

			</ul>
			<p>In an IT-oriented value stream, the Kanban Card typically lists the User Story and its acceptance criteria. If the Kanban Card originates from operations, the card should include a ticket number, a description of the problem (defect or bug), the date of the issue, and the person who reported it. </p>
			<p>Finally, the Kanban Card should also include information on any issues or<a id="_idTextAnchor253"/> bugs (also known as <em class="italic">blockers</em>) that were <a id="_idIndexMarker1002"/>discovered during development or testing that prevent work from being carried out.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Weighted Shortest Job First</strong> (<strong class="bold">WSJF</strong>): This <a id="_idIndexMarker1003"/>queueing model has gained acceptance in the Lean-Agile community, particularly among SAFE practitioners. The method was initially defined by Don Reinertsen in his book <em class="italic">Principles of Product Development Flow</em> (Reinertsen, 2009).</p>
			<p>The WSJF prioritization model is used to sequence jobs (for example, Features, Capabilities, and Epics) to produce maximum economic benefit. In SAFe, WSJF is estimated as the <strong class="bold">Cost of Delay</strong> (<strong class="bold">CoD</strong>) divided <a id="_idIndexMarker1004"/>by job size.</p>
			<p>For example, let's assume <a id="_idIndexMarker1005"/>we have three <a id="_idIndexMarker1006"/>work items in our product backlog, and the product owner needs a way to assess priorities among them for the upcoming development iterations. The following table identifies the estimated durations as lead times in weeks, the cost of delays in lost revenues, and the adjusted weights for each work item:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer088" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_09_06.jpg" alt="Figure 9.6 – Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) example&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.6 – Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) example</p>
			<p>The preceding table shows that each week of delay in releasing Feature A costs the organization $10,000/ week, while Feature B has a cost of 100,000/ week, and Feature C will cost the company $150,000/ week. Assuming our CoD and duration estimates are reasonably accurate, Feature C should have the highest priority, followed by B, and then A. </p>
			<p>Besides managing how work items flow through a value stream system, we also need to level the flows to maintain continuous flows. This topic will be discussed in the next subsection on line balancing.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor254"/>Balancing our value stream flows</h2>
			<p>Implementing a pull-based <a id="_idIndexMarker1007"/>production control system is of little value if there are no work items to pull in the preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker1008"/>value stream activities. We need to instill <strong class="bold">line balancing</strong> techniques <a id="_idIndexMarker1009"/>to prevent the starvation of upstream activities. To achieve this, we must optimize the distribution of work in progress across our value stream so that it matches our Takt time.</p>
			<p>In a fully automated system, <strong class="bold">line balancing</strong> is a function of the system's design. For example, automobiles progressing through an assembly line are tied to a belt so that everything moves simultaneously, at the same rate of speed. However, the work stations in many development and operations-oriented value streams are not integrated, nor are they automated. Moreover, the operators may move between workstations and equipment to support multiple work activities across the value stream. </p>
			<p>Line balancing is a strategy that's used to optimize the utilization of people within a value stream. The goal is to ensure our operators are not overburdened or underutilized. The VSM team uses the following equation to determine the number of workers needed to operate any given activity within the value stream:</p>
			<p><em class="italic"># workers needed=total_process_cycle_time/takt time</em></p>
			<p>Recall that our Takt time for the IT value stream in <em class="italic">Figure 9.1</em> was 7 hours per work item. The VSM team has already identified each activity's total cycle times in our IT value stream, as identified in the following table. So, we have the data we need to determine the number of dev team members to support our IT value stream.</p>
			<p>The following table uses the previously identified line balancing equation to calculate the number of workers required to support the IT value stream across the entire IT value stream: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer089" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_09_07.jpg" alt="Figure 9.7 – Line balancing equation to determine the number of required operators&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.7 – Line balancing equation to determine the number of required operators</p>
			<p>Our total value-added times were a measure of all the cycle times across the IT value stream activities. But the value-added times (cycle times) are measures for processing one work item at a time. Because the development team works as a Scrum-based Agile team, we have to adjust the Takt time by a multiple of six to account for the total time required to produce six items, which – at 42 hours – is our pitch for this value stream. </p>
			<p>Therefore, with <a id="_idIndexMarker1010"/>these measures, the <a id="_idIndexMarker1011"/>VSM team concludes that they need 7.8 development team members to staff the IT value stream. But things are never this easy. For one, the development team members process the entire lot of six work items at once in the <em class="italic">Refine</em>, <em class="italic">Plan</em>, and <em class="italic">Release</em> processes, but independently in the <em class="italic">Code</em>, <em class="italic">Build</em>, <em class="italic">Test</em>, <em class="italic">Merge</em>, and <em class="italic">Provision</em> processes. </p>
			<p>The following table shows the lot size adjustments that have been made to adjust the hours so that they match work item's throughput, and then calculate the number of workers required across each IT value stream activity:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer090" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_09_08.jpg" alt="Figure 9.8 – Adjusted cycle times per work item to calculate the number of required workers&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.8 – Adjusted cycle times per work item to calculate the number of required workers</p>
			<p>The following table reevaluates the number of workers against the adjusted total value-added time of 90.5 hours. The adjusted TVA of 90.5 hours divided by our original Takt time of 7 hours indicates the IT value stream requires 12.9 workers to support the load:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer091" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_09_09.jpg" alt="Figure 9.9 – TVA and labor adjustments&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.9 – TVA and labor adjustments</p>
			<p>However, let's go back and look at Figure 9.7. It should be evident that the labor levels across the individual value stream activities vary significantly, from as few as 0.4 workers to as many as 3.4 workers. We would run into resource allocation issues if we tried to operate this value stream with single-piece flows. </p>
			<p>To continue our assessment, let's carve out the development-related activities from the refine and release-related activities. Other people in the organization typically perform release-related activities, and a subset of the development team conducts refinement activities as a group before each Sprint iteration. </p>
			<p>The VSM team creates a current state worker balance chart to start assessing the development stream, as shown in the following diagram. This chart shows us that if we were to dedicate resources to each activity, working at the rate of Takt time, there would be a lot of wasted time for all the workers waiting on new work, except for those dedicated to testing. This is because the testers don't have enough hours to conduct their tests within the Takt time of 7 hours per work item:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer092" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_09_10.jpg" alt="Figure 9.10 – Current state worker balance chart&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.10 – Current state worker balance chart</p>
			<p>It should be evident <a id="_idIndexMarker1012"/>that you don't need to dedicate a worker <a id="_idIndexMarker1013"/>to each activity. The whole point of Agile is to build cross-functional and self-contained teams where all the development team members can perform most, if not all, tasks in the software delivery value stream:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer093" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_09_11.jpg" alt="Figure 9.11 – Future state worker balance chart &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.11 – Future state worker balance chart </p>
			<p>As we can see, there are <a id="_idIndexMarker1014"/>three logical areas to break down work by combining tasks. Within the team, one or more individuals <a id="_idIndexMarker1015"/>can work on the plan, code, build, and merge activities. At the same time, other folks provision the servers and set up, run, analyze, and distribute test results. </p>
			<p>Note that the software tests can run in a <strong class="bold">lights-out automation</strong> fashion. Once the tests have been set up and initiated, the tests run in an automated fashion without human attendance. Babysitting computers is not a value-adding activity and is one of the reasons why test automation is so important. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-206"><a id="_idTextAnchor255"/>Stabilizing work practices </h2>
			<p>This section <a id="_idIndexMarker1016"/>touches on a subject – creating standard practices – that some IT professionals may find questionable. The idea of implementing standardized work practices, at first glance, may seem restrictive, especially to those who view software development as much an art as it is a science. However, as we'll see later in this book, a mature DevOps pipeline – one that integrates and automates SDLC practices – only works when we have standardized processes. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Standardized work</strong> is an <a id="_idIndexMarker1017"/>agreed-upon set of work procedures that establish the best current method and sequence of activities to complete each defined value stream process. In other words, standard practices implement the best, easiest, safest, and fastest way to perform work within the value stream. </p>
			<p>Note that the concept of <a id="_idIndexMarker1018"/>standardized work in Lean appears to deviate from the ideals espoused in Agile, where teams are generally free to experiment freely with new ways of working. The focus of Lean is to eliminate waste and improve continuous flows, whereas Agile's focus is on being adaptive and supporting the creative aspects of turning requirements into actionable architectures and designs prior to each new product release. </p>
			<p>The issue is really one of demarcation between innovation and production. Innovation tends to be a creative process, also called the fuzzy front end, that is difficult to scope. In contrast, production development processes work best when they're standardized for optimal value delivery.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Fuzzy Front End (FFE)</p>
			<p class="callout">The term <strong class="bold">fuzzy front end</strong> describes the "<em class="italic">innovation phase</em>" of each new product or feature <a id="_idIndexMarker1019"/>development life cycle. Specifically, the FFE includes the initial phase of creating new products or features, where opportunities are identified, architecture and design concepts are developed, and construction and delivery strategies evolve prior to entering the product development phase. The FFE phenomenon exists in both Lean- and Agile-based development scenarios.</p>
			<p>Once software development gets to the production stage, it makes no sense to automate an integrated process where the individual activities have such variability that it's impossible to control the flow of work or eliminate defects and errors. The whole point of implementing a CI/CD or DevOps pipeline is to improve work and information flows to improve value delivery. And we cannot improve flows without standardized processes and activities. </p>
			<p>The VSM team needs to work with the engineers, domain experts, and operators to fix them first. Later, we can employ technology to help integrate and automate the underlying activities. </p>
			<p>The VSM team may find it useful to use the <strong class="bold">Standard Work Combination Timesheet</strong> shown in the following image to capture this information during their Gemba walks. The worksheet provides rows to record the steps across a linked workflow within a value stream. In other words, an operator is expected to complete all these steps before starting work on another work item or a "lot" of work items. The VSM team records the amount of time required to complete each task and specifies whether the work is a manual or automated task, or whether it is related to moving or transport.</p>
			<p>In our example, the <a id="_idIndexMarker1020"/>VSM team identified the following nine high-level steps (activities) that define the CI/CD pipeline flow for the software development team. The team lists the activities in the order they're carried out:</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Requirements analysis</strong>: Define the user stories and their acceptance criteria.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Feature design</strong>: Determine the software feature implementation requirements and development tests.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Write test scripts</strong>: As part of test-driven development practices, develop the test necessary to demonstrate code compliance with the requirements.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Develop code</strong>: Create the source code that implements the desired features in accordance with their acceptance criteria.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Unit testing</strong>: Conduct tests on each segment of code before you conduct integration tests to ensure they meet the requirements specified in the user stories and acceptance criteria.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Merge code</strong>: Integrate the source code after passing unit tests in with the mainline code in the source control repository. Ensure there are no errors with the integration.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Provision the pre-production server</strong>: Execute <strong class="bold">Infrastructure as Code </strong>(<strong class="bold">IaC</strong>) configuration instructions <a id="_idIndexMarker1021"/>that automate standing up the pre-production server test environments.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Initiate pre-production tests</strong>: Execute the automated test in the pre-production test environments, as defined in the product's test plan:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer094" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_09_12.jpg" alt="Figure 9.12 – Standard Work Combination Timesheet&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.12 – Standard Work Combination Timesheet</p>
			<p>The standard <a id="_idIndexMarker1022"/>worksheet also provides space to display the flow of work over time visually. A vertical line displays the Takt time for the work items in the context of the overall time associated with the workflow. When the overall workflow time exceeds the Takt time, we know that the value stream segment cannot meet customer order demands, as currently designed.  </p>
			<p>The Standard Work Combination Timesheet example shown here records the entire set of tasks for a work item flowing through the development work associated with the IT value stream. The worksheet tells us that it's impossible to move a work item through all the development and testing tasks within the Takt time associated with our customer's demands. We can evaluate ways to fix these issues by integrating and automating SDLC processes by implementing CI/CD toolchains and DevOps pipelines. </p>
			<p>This concept is fundamentally what modern CI/ CD and DevOps toolchains and pipelines are about – eliminating variances across system development and operations-oriented activities. In both the Agile and Lean practices, the teams employ their workers' creativity via their product delivery skills and via Kaizen or retrospectives to make continuous improvements to their standardized processes. The objective of Kaizen is to make improvements that minimize risks, not increase them. </p>
			<p>To summarize, standardized work does the following things:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer095" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_09_9.11_table.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>With the information we've gathered <a id="_idIndexMarker1023"/>to complete the <em class="italic">Standard Work Combination Timesheet</em>, the VSM team can start evaluating ways to eliminate waste and improve flows. One common form of waste is motion; that is, having activities and work stations placed so far apart that we increase not-value-added time and resources simply moving people and materials between work areas. In the next section, you will learn how to improve work areas to eliminate waste from excess motion.  </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-207"><a id="_idTextAnchor256"/>Changing work layouts</h2>
			<p>Whether your VSM team is <a id="_idIndexMarker1024"/>working with a value stream to build physical products or software products, or to support administrative operations, facility layouts are critical to improving flow. The critical issue is to eliminate waste in the form of excessive transport and movement. These issues result from inefficient facility layouts or locating departments, business functions, or operations across disparate sites or geographies.  </p>
			<p>The VSM team needs to work with executive management to obtain funding and approvals, co-locate value stream activities, and change its layout to implement Lean production flows. In <a href="B17087_03_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a><em class="italic">, Analyzing Complex Systems Interactions</em>, you learned that optimum Lean flows in a diagrammatic <a id="_idIndexMarker1025"/>form display a <strong class="bold">linear sequential flow</strong> for the work. However, in an actual physical work environment, a linear sequential flow might not be the best. </p>
			<p>Instead, it's often better to <a id="_idIndexMarker1026"/>have the workflow wrap back around to reduce waste related to the operator excessively transporting materials and motion within the value stream. Therefore, an optimal flow within a facility might have <em class="italic">U</em>, <em class="italic">C</em>, or <em class="italic">L</em>-shaped work areas, as shown in the following image:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer096" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.13 – Facility layout designs</p>
			<p>As the VSM team evaluates alternative layouts, they need to overlay the flow of work. That is the topic of the next subsection.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-208"><a id="_idTextAnchor257"/>Displaying standardized work</h2>
			<p>As the VSM team works <a id="_idIndexMarker1027"/>to improve <a id="_idIndexMarker1028"/>standardized work methods and flow, everyone working in the value stream must understand how to perform the work across multiple activities. This strategy provides the greatest flexibility in moving people to maintain flow across all activities.</p>
			<p>The organization may employ detailed documentation or shop processes describing the work in both development and operations-oriented value streams. In many cases, all the operators need is a simple visual reminder of the standardized work tasks. A <strong class="bold">Standardized Work Chart</strong> is an <a id="_idIndexMarker1029"/>example of such a display, as shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer097" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_09_14.jpg" alt="Figure 9.14 – Standardized Work Chart&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.14 – Standardized Work Chart</p>
			<p>At this point, the VSM team <a id="_idIndexMarker1030"/>has analyzed the <a id="_idIndexMarker1031"/>elements of work that can improve customer flows. Now, let's move on to developing the value stream's future state map of continuous flows. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor258"/>Drawing the continuous flow phase map</h2>
			<p>Before the VSM team <a id="_idIndexMarker1032"/>starts to draw their <strong class="bold">future state map of continuous flow</strong> improvements, they should <a id="_idIndexMarker1033"/>review the analysis work:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">First, the team must go back and review the current state map and the demand-phase maps. </li>
				<li>Then, the VSM team members must go through the flow questions, and the information they obtained on their Gemba walks, that answer those questions. </li>
				<li>Next, if they haven't <a id="_idIndexMarker1034"/>done so already, the VSM team members must draw the current and future state <strong class="bold">worker balance charts</strong>. </li>
				<li>Finally, they must go back and review the value stream symbols that we identified in <em class="italic">Figure 7.1</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As with the <a id="_idIndexMarker1035"/>previous maps, there is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1036"/>preferred sequence of activities that aid in producing future state – continuous flow map – as shown here:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Use the demand phase map as the starting point.</li>
				<li>Using the Standard Work Timesheet and Standardized Work Chart for guidance, draw the work locations in the map's proper sequence.</li>
				<li>In the VSM Storyboard (see <em class="italic">Appendix B</em>), enter the number of workers in the proposed cycle times of work areas on the map.</li>
				<li>Enter all the identified attributes in the appropriate work area locations.</li>
				<li>Determine the tasks that support continuous flows.</li>
				<li>Indicate on the map where to initiate pull-oriented production control strategies.</li>
				<li>If required, display the placement of supermarket inventories.</li>
				<li>Display where FIFO workflows occur.</li>
				<li>Determine where Kanban signals are required.</li>
				<li>Identify other improvement activities required to improve flows (for example, Kaizen Burst icons).</li>
				<li>Display all necessary communications links on the map.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As the VSM team <a id="_idIndexMarker1037"/>begins to draw <a id="_idIndexMarker1038"/>the future state continuous flow map, they need to keep the following in mind: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Implementing a continuous flow means that queues and waiting are eliminated.</li>
				<li>Evaluate work area designs and make change recommendations.</li>
				<li>The team needs executive approvals and funding to make significant changes.</li>
				<li>Lean production control pulls upstream work so that it's in sync with customer demand.</li>
				<li>Communicate reasons and benefits for all change recommendations.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following diagram shows the VSM team's future state map of proposed continuous flow improvements across the IT value stream:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer098" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_09_15.jpg" alt="Figure 9.15 – Future state map of continuous flow improvements across the IT value stream&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.15 – Future state map of continuous flow improvements across the IT value stream</p>
			<p>As you review the <a id="_idIndexMarker1039"/>future state map, note <a id="_idIndexMarker1040"/>how the map now indicates numerous communications links, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Backlog refinement.</li>
				<li>Creating Definitions of Done for each user story.</li>
				<li>The development team obtains clarifications on requirements during development.</li>
				<li>Communicating test results from the automated tests.</li>
				<li>Moving code in and out of the source control management repository.</li>
				<li>Communicating server configurations for provisioning. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>The VSM team has also identified four new improvement initiatives, identified by the Kaizen Burst icons for implementing Kanban signaling at two locations, as Kanban withdrawals associated with the Product and Sprint Backlogs: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>A new design for the development team's facilities</li>
				<li>A Kanban signaling and visualization production control system</li>
				<li>A FIFO production control strategy between development and test</li>
				<li>Implementation of test automation capabilities to enable testing to operate in a "lights out" capacity</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Finally, note that we have replaced the individual development steps with two areas of activity – one for development and the other for testing. Technically, there is a third area associated with provisioning, which is the data center. However, all interactions with the data center are done through electronic communications to help implement infrastructure changes via code. This is <a id="_idIndexMarker1041"/>also known as <strong class="bold">Infrastructure as Code</strong> (<strong class="bold">IaC</strong>). </p>
			<p>The release process is also separated from development since those activities fall outside the IT development stream domain. That's not to imply the development team members are not involved in release activities. The VSM team has elected to review those activities at a later date in a separate mapping exercise. </p>
			<p>This section completes the future state - continuous flow improvement mapping section. Before we <a id="_idIndexMarker1042"/>leave this <a id="_idIndexMarker1043"/>section altogether, let's quickly review the tools that we used in this section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor259"/>Future state – continuous flow tools</h2>
			<p>In this section, you <a id="_idIndexMarker1044"/>learned to ask several questions that <a id="_idIndexMarker1045"/>help the VSM team assess the state of continuous flows across a value stream. Then, you learned the importance of using <em class="italic">pull-oriented production control strategies</em> to manage continuous flows. The three pull-oriented production control strategies include using <em class="italic">supermarket inventories,FIFO workflows, and Kanban-based signaling</em>.  </p>
			<p>You learned the importance of establishing standardized work as a prelude to enabling integration and automation of value stream activities. The two primary tools that are used to evaluate work activities are the <em class="italic">Standardized Work Timesheet</em> and the<em class="italic"> Standardized Work Chart</em>.</p>
			<p>Another important consideration in improving the flow of work and materials is the facility's <em class="italic">design and layouts</em>. Lean processes can implement linear-sequential flows with minimal waste associated with motion and travel. However, in many instances, it makes sense to redirect the linear sequential flows so that they wrap back to the front, such as via "U" or "C" shaped cells, or off to the side via an "L" shaped work cell. </p>
			<p>In many value streams, the operator's most efficient use of time allows them to move between work cells or equipment. To leverage our human talent in this manner, they must be cross-trained in several – if not all – value stream activities. Moreover, the U- and C-shaped cells offer less movement between work locations. </p>
			<p>In this section, you also learned <a id="_idIndexMarker1046"/>how to employ the <strong class="bold">Worker Balance Chart</strong> to <a id="_idIndexMarker1047"/>balance operators' utilization across a value stream's activities.</p>
			<p>Finally, as we have been doing throughout the value stream management chapters, you learned how to update the VSM Storyboard to show the future state changes governing improvements to continuous flows. You also used several <em class="italic">flow-phase symbols</em> (Icons) in this exercise.</p>
			<p>This section completes our discussion on developing future state maps to assess areas for improving continuous flows across the value stream. Now, we'll move on and learn how to use future state <a id="_idIndexMarker1048"/>mapping to improve leveling work. This <a id="_idIndexMarker1049"/>allows us to efficiently utilize our value stream resources while simultaneously meeting customer demand. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor260"/>Phase 3 – leveling</h1>
			<p>At this point, the <a id="_idIndexMarker1050"/>VSM team has conducted a series of Gemba walks to collect information they used for their value stream mapping exercises. They <a id="_idIndexMarker1051"/>have built a current state map and future state maps to guide improvements in meeting customer demand and implementing continuous flows. The last future state map they will construct helps guide improvements in production leveling.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Leveling</strong> is a strategy that's used to distribute the work required to support our customers' demands over time. Our goal is to continuously feed our value stream with new customer orders, at the rate of the Takt time, so that we don't lose production time while waiting for new orders to arrive and have other times where the value stream contains more work than it can take on. </p>
			<p>In an ideal state, production leveling aims to produce the same number of items consistently and just at the rate of the Takt time. Unfortunately, customer orders don't often come in as a continuous flow. They may come in batches, and the number of requested items can vary with each customer request. So, we have to implement strategies to flatten demand curves that match our value streams' production rates. </p>
			<p>The time increments that are used depend on the total value added and total lead times associated with our products. In some cases, we can level work over hours, days, or weeks. However, we might need to level work over months or even years if we're constructing large buildings, aircraft or ships.</p>

			<p>By analogy, you can think of <a id="_idIndexMarker1052"/>trying to flow water through a hose. Let's assume we have a garden hose that can hold one gallon of water at any given moment. If we try to flow 10 gallons of water all at once, the hose's size restricts flow, plus the hose can only contain one gallon of water at a time. </p>
			<p>Unless we have a very flexible hose, allowing the water to bulge through the pipe, the 10 gallons of water only moves through the hose incrementally at a rate the hose can sustain without bursting; that is, the rate at which one gallon can traverse the hose from end to end.  </p>
			<p>Also, if we divide our hose <a id="_idIndexMarker1053"/>into eight equal sections, each section will contain exactly one-eighth of a gallon of water at any given time. To complete our analogy, water must flow out of the hose's last section before the water in the upstream sections can flow into the linked downstream sections. Lean value streams operate in precisely this fashion, as continuous and equal flows. </p>
			<p>We use the term <strong class="bold">pipeline</strong> to refer to the flows across our value streams. As an example, the following diagram shows the DevOps processes as a linear-sequential flow of work across eight primary activities:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer099" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_09_16.jpg" alt="Figure 9.16 – DevOps pipeline shown as a linear-sequential process&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.16 – DevOps pipeline shown as a linear-sequential process</p>
			<p>Of course, in real life, the monitoring activities obtain information that's been fed back to the development team as input for future planning activities. For that reason, the DevOps pipeline is more often displayed as an infinity loop, as shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer100" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_09_17.jpg" alt="Figure 9.17 – DevOps pipeline displayed as an infinity loop&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.17 – DevOps pipeline displayed as an infinity loop</p>
			<p>Neither graphical model is ideal, as new requirements come in from multiple sources. We'll discuss this issue in the <a id="_idIndexMarker1054"/>leveling production flows subsection. Before we get to that topic, let's look at what questions the VSM team asks in this phase of the VSM initiative.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-213"><a id="_idTextAnchor262"/>Assessing leveling needs</h2>
			<p>As with the previous <a id="_idIndexMarker1055"/>future state mapping exercises, the VSM team can ask questions to help assess the needs for production leveling. Let's take a quick look at such questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Do customer orders arrive more or less at a constant and predictable rate?</li>
				<li>Are the value stream's operators experiencing high and low peaks of activity as a result of changes in customer demand?</li>
				<li>Can we group incoming orders to level demand loads?</li>
				<li>Can we predict future orders sufficiently, in both volume and type, to build ahead of demands? If so, how far in advance can we build with minimal risks?</li>
				<li>Can we group orders in lots to improve the flows?</li>
				<li>When materials or parts must flow into various stages of our value stream, how will we distribute Kanban Cards to accurately flow the materials so that they sync with the work items?</li>
				<li>Where in the value stream should we schedule production/work requirements?</li>
				<li>Can we use <strong class="bold">paced withdrawal</strong> or a Heijunka box to manage the flow of lots?</li>
				<li>Do we need to employ runners to keep materials flowing and in balance?</li>
				<li>What other methods and tools can we employ to improve production leveling?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we know what questions we need to answer, let's describe the concepts behind production leveling while using our IT value stream model as a reference. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-214"><a id="_idTextAnchor263"/>Leveling concepts</h2>
			<p>At this stage of future state mapping, we need to concentrate on drawing the elements that help the value stream in leveling production. The problem this phase addresses is that customers seldom predictably bring us orders. When we have too many orders all at once, we may not have the production capacity to work through them quickly. At other times, the orders may come in at a slower rate that doesn't fill our capacity, which means our value stream is starved for work.</p>
			<p>The objective of <a id="_idIndexMarker1056"/>production leveling is to distribute our work over time to meet our customer demand. In high-volume production environments, we may need to level the flows once a shift or possibly even more frequently. On the other hand, retail manufacturers may have a much higher sales volume during the holiday seasons, which forces them to build in advance.</p>
			<p>The VSM team waits until this late stage to manage leveling issues, because they need to understand the Takt time and optimal pitch for their value stream to match customer demand. Additionally, the VSM team needs time to work through the value stream activities to optimize flows to the greatest extent possible. In other words, there are more gains to be made in productivity by addressing issues with meeting customer demand and improving flows. Production leveling is more of a fine-tuning exercise than a significant change initiative.</p>
			<p>In our previous IT value stream example, we noted that the Product Owner introduces, on average, 20 new requirements into the product backlog every 4 weeks. The Product owner receives these requests from multiple sources, including the IT shop's operations staff, directly from customers, industry sources, and product and marketing management teams. </p>
			<p>It's doubtful that the product owner receives exactly one new requirement every day. Instead, they come in randomly and often in spurts – especially after the product marketing groups have conducted customer interviews and focused group sessions. When the new requirements arrive in batch, they are added to the product backlog to sit in a queue until the development team can start working on them.</p>
			<p>Under Scrum-based agile practices, the development team evaluates how much work in the product backlog they believe they can take on and complete within the sprint's duration. In our example, the team pulls a batch of user stories from the product backlog as one lot of six work items to work through the Sprint. Once the work items have been selected, the team divides the work among the team members, and the team members work on each user story from start to finish. </p>
			<p>All dev team members have all the skills necessary to work the item through the entire SDLC process in an ideal world. But that's not always the case. Moreover, depending on the complexity of a work item, the team may assign more than one team member to implement the capabilities outlined in a single user story. </p>
			<p>The Scrum team <a id="_idIndexMarker1057"/>example here is a method of production leveling across a Sprint. The items are taken in as a lot and worked on independently through the SDLC processes. But there is a problem since the team is working on six work items over 10 days. In that same 10-day period, the product backlog is likely to receive 10 new work items. In other words, the IT value stream is ignoring four new customer demand throughout every 2-week Sprint. Not only does this represent lost business, but it also opens the doors to your competitors to fill the void.</p>
			<p>Production leveling alone is not going to solve this problem. The VSM team needs to work with the system engineers to implement the CI/CD and DevOps toolchains and pipelines to expedite workflows. In the long run, the VSM team should work with the IT department to implement capabilities that match the Takt time of one work item's completion per day. Faster flow rates provide surge capacity and the ability to make up for lost time if the IT systems go down.</p>
			<p>Referring back to in <em class="italic">Figure 9.15</em>, with a mature DevOps pipeline, one work item leaves the pipeline every day, and other work items flow at the same speed throughout the pipeline. This means that one new work item can enter the DevOps pipeline every day. But since customer requirements come in haphazardly and often in batches, the development team still needs an incoming buffer, in the form of a product backlog, to store and manage the new requirements until they've been refined, prioritized, and pulled into the IT value stream. </p>
			<p>While the IT department is implementing the new CI/CD toolchains, the VSM team begins to work out their production leveling strategies for the new development and testing environments. Let's take a look at the methods they can use to level production volumes.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-215"><a id="_idTextAnchor264"/>Leveling methods</h2>
			<p>There are several methods the VSM team can explore for production leveling. In this section, you will learn about the 5S methods for leveling, including <strong class="bold">Kanban Boards</strong>, <strong class="bold">paced withdrawals</strong>, <strong class="bold">Heijunka boxes</strong>, <strong class="bold">visual controls</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Kanban folders</strong>. </p>
			<p>Not all of these strategies <a id="_idIndexMarker1058"/>work in every value stream. Moreover, Lean-Agile production has sufficient uniqueness to drive the evolution of a relatively new variant of Kanban that uses sticky notes and whiteboards to level flows across a Sprint. Known as a <strong class="bold">Kanban Board</strong>, we'll start with a description of that scheduling and leveling method first.</p>
			<h3>Kanban Boards</h3>
			<p>The product owner will usually bring new work items to the development team's attention in an IT environment. Each requirement's new work item instructions are typically noted on a sticky card and placed in the <em class="italic">Product Backlog</em> column on a whiteboard. The sticky notes are the Kanban signals, and the whiteboards are called Kanban Boards. Refer back to <em class="italic">Figure 9.9 – Kanban Board for an IT value stream</em>.</p>
			<p>However, the initial requirements, expressed as business and user requirements, may be too broadly defined to develop as a succinct set of functional and nonfunctional capabilities. The development team members work with the product owner to refine the requirements into distinct and smaller user stories, representing the smallest work units that results in a definable capability.</p>
			<p>User stories most often express the requirements from the customer's point of view. With this point of reference, a typical format for the user story is as follows:</p>
			<p><em class="italic">As a (type of user), I want to (describe capability desired), so that (reason).</em></p>
			<p>The user story should also define the acceptance criteria, which ultimately specify the story's Definition of Done. The following format helps define the acceptance criteria for a user story. Note that each user story may require multiple acceptance criteria statements to define all potential scenarios:</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Given [a scenario] when [something happens] then [describe expected result].</em></p>
			<p>The product owner then collaborates with the development team to determine priorities for the identified user stories. However, the development team makes the ultimate decision regarding the amount of work involved with each user story and the pace they can sustain. </p>
			<p>This refinement work occurs during the planning phase of each Sprint, and the output is a Sprint Goal plus selected user stories that support the achievement of the Sprint's goal. The development team moves the Kanban Cards, one for each user story, into the <em class="italic">Sprint Backlog</em> column on the Kanban Board. </p>
			<p>The user stories may <a id="_idIndexMarker1059"/>need further clarification before the development <a id="_idIndexMarker1060"/>team members can start developing and testing the functionality associated with each user story. Once the stories have been sufficiently developed, the Kanban Cards are moved into the <strong class="bold">To Do</strong> section of the Kanban Board. The development team members pull Kanban Cards from the <strong class="bold">To Do</strong> column and place them in the <strong class="bold">In Process'</strong> column, while they are developing and testing the functionality associated with that card's user story.  </p>
			<p>Once the developers have completed their work, they move the Kanban Card into the <strong class="bold">To Verify</strong> column. The verification process has another set of eyes review the work to ensure the new code implements the desired functionality and meets the standards set in its acceptance criteria. Once they have verified the new code's functionality, the Kanban Card is moved into the <strong class="bold">Done</strong> column to indicate that the work meets the acceptance criteria for the user story.</p>
			<p>Some teams may elect to implement additional columns on their Kanban Boards to track the work they perform at a more granular level. That's OK. The critical issue is not to get into such small levels of detail that the tracking effort becomes overly burdensome. </p>
			<h3>Paced withdrawals</h3>
			<p>The Kanban Boards we <a id="_idIndexMarker1061"/>previously described best <a id="_idIndexMarker1062"/>support leveling of work for teams that work close by, often in the same room. Therefore, Kanban Boards are useful in software delivery or other administrative or operations-oriented types of value streams. In contrast, the paced withdrawal method of production leveling works in environments that are developing physical products, and where the workstations and equipment are spread out over a large area.</p>
			<p>Paced <a id="_idIndexMarker1063"/>withdrawals use a <strong class="bold">human handler</strong> (also known as <strong class="bold">Runners</strong>) to move information and work <a id="_idIndexMarker1064"/>items along a value stream's activities, following the value stream's flow sequence. The handler sets the pace for the value stream as they move from operation to operation, moving parts and information from one work location to another.</p>
			<p>The following diagram shows the paced withdrawal method of production leveling:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer101" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_09_18.jpg" alt="Figure 9.18 – Paced withdrawal leveling method&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.18 – Paced withdrawal leveling method</p>
			<p>Let's take a closer <a id="_idIndexMarker1065"/>look at how production flow leveling works <a id="_idIndexMarker1066"/>using the preceding diagram:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">The Runner (handler) starts a cycle by picking up the current production Kanban from a Heijunka box. A production Kanban is simply a detailed list of all items that need to be completed by a specific time. The Heijunka box has slots that map to specific time increments throughout the day. Each slot can hold a folder that contains the customer orders scheduled for that period.  </li>
				<li>The Runner takes the production Kanban to the most upstream work area to hand off the new orders. </li>
				<li>The Runner later picks up the WIP goods at the location for activity 2 and moves them on to the next work area, to conduct activity 3. </li>
				<li>When the work at activity location 3 is complete, the Runner moves that part to the workstation for activity 4.</li>
				<li>When the Runner reaches the most downstream activity, they move the finished goods into a supermarket to hold the inventory until the products are picked up by or shipped to the customer.</li>
				<li>At that point, the handler picks up new customer orders (that is, in the form of production Kanban information) and moves those documents to the value stream's Heijunka box. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>This completes the <a id="_idIndexMarker1067"/>original cycle, and the handler starts the cycle again. The <a id="_idIndexMarker1068"/>key is to match the handler's cycle time to the pitch rate. This strategy limits production quantities as WIP while simultaneously matching flows to meet customer demand. </p>
			<p>You may be wondering why you are learning about leveling strategies for value streams that build physical products. The short answer is because we all operate within a digital economy. IT teams often support the improvements in manufacturing and other types of development-oriented value streams, so IT specialists must understand how Lean processes work in other organizational value streams. </p>
			<p>For example, the IT department <a id="_idIndexMarker1069"/>may implement changes to the organization's <strong class="bold">Enterprise Resource Planning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ERP</strong>) or <strong class="bold">Manufacturing Requirements Planning</strong> (<strong class="bold">MRP II</strong>) systems to <a id="_idIndexMarker1070"/>support evolving customer needs and business opportunities. Such modern business applications help integrate and automate business processes spanning inventory management, warehouse management, accounting and financial management, order <a id="_idIndexMarker1071"/>management, scheduling, purchasing, shipping, <strong class="bold">customer relationship management</strong> (<strong class="bold">CRM</strong>), and e-commerce. These functions operate as value streams within the organization, and most Lean improvements across these value streams require associated changes to be made to the enterprise business systems.  </p>
			<h3>Heijunka boxes</h3>
			<p>As mentioned previously, the Heijunka box is <a id="_idIndexMarker1072"/>essentially a slotted <a id="_idIndexMarker1073"/>cabinet that holds production Kanban folders. The following diagram shows two examples of a Heijunka box:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer102" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_09_19.jpg" alt="Figure 9.19 – Heijunka box&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.19 – Heijunka box</p>
			<p>Each folder holds the production Kanban instructions for the work items produced by the value stream in that lot. The slots within the Heijunka box indicate the times within which the production items should be produced. </p>
			<p>The Heijunka box on the <a id="_idIndexMarker1074"/>left is slotted to support two shifts with 1-hour time <a id="_idIndexMarker1075"/>periods scheduled between starting each new batch. In other words, each slot contains a Kanban folder with the production Kanban instructions to build the desired lot of work items within a 1-hour pitch. </p>
			<p>The Heijunka box on the right is slotted to support three product types across one shift. The scheduler that's determining production capacities in a value stream with multiple product types. This determines how many items of each type can be produced within each slotted time frame. </p>
			<p>Though we mentioned the Heijunka box as part of the paced withdrawal leveling method, the Heijunka box can stand alone as a leveling tool. In such cases, the Heijunka box is a visual workflow control method. Instead of using a Runner in a co-located space, such as in an administrative office, the employees can pull work directly from the boxes. </p>
			<h3>Visual controls</h3>
			<p>Instead of a Heijunka box, the <a id="_idIndexMarker1076"/>VSM team may elect to implement a <a id="_idIndexMarker1077"/>Visual Pitch Board to guide production flows across the day. The Pitch Board is a table that displays the number of each operator's work assignments across the pitch times within their shift. This a useful mechanism for operations-oriented value streams to level the flow of work within an administrative area.</p>
			<p>For example, let's assume a value stream receives, on average, 20 new work item requests per hour and that four operators have been assigned to work on these tasks. This visual aid type works in both development and operations-oriented workstreams, where everyone can easily see the visual Pitch Board display. In other words, we don't need a runner, and the operators can pull their production Kanban Cards directly from the production control system. </p>
			<p>The following is a sample Visible Pitch board for an administrative department:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer103" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_09_20.jpg" alt="Figure 9.20 – Visual Pitch Board – order entry value stream example&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.20 – Visual Pitch Board – order entry value stream example</p>
			<p>In this example, the average pitch is 19 customer orders every hour, but with a low of 18 and a high of 20 customer orders. The scheduler has distributed the work so that no single order entry clerk has excessive orders every hour.</p>
			<p>With a maximum order entry rate of five orders per hour per operator, the cycle time for each order entry activity is 12 minutes. But, in every 1-hour slot, one or two order entry clerks only need to work on four customer orders, giving them 12 minutes of open time. In addition, however, these individuals can work on other value-adding tasks, such as answering customer calls or emails.</p>
			<p>The number of work items (pitch) assigned to individual workers can vary based on their skills and other duties they may perform. Also, note that the Pitch Board distributes workload by volume only and does not include instructions on the required work. In this case, the clerks receive colored Kanban folders that contain such instructions. </p>
			<h3>Kanban folders</h3>
			<p>Kanban folders contain <a id="_idIndexMarker1078"/>production Kanban information. They are used in <a id="_idIndexMarker1079"/>paced withdrawal systems, or in standalone Heijunka boxes, or distributed to team members who get their work assignment notifications via a Visual Pitch Board. For example, the production Kanban contains information on the performance of standardized work and the customer order requirements. In addition, the Kanban folders may be color-coded to indicate which operator the work has been assigned to or indicate the type of standardized work that's being performed. </p>
			<p>In the paced withdrawal system, the Kanban folder flows with work and is moved by the Runner. In the standalone Heijunka boxes, the operators pull the work from the slots associated with the type of work they perform and the time of day. Typically, when a Visual Pitch Board is used, the local manager distributes the Kanban folders directly to the operators at a standard interval. The intervals set the pace, and the folders help break out and distribute the work across the operators.</p>
			<p>This section concludes our discussion on leveling methods. After evaluating and choosing the appropriate leveling methods, the VSM team can move on and draw the future state value stream leveling map.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-216"><a id="_idTextAnchor265"/>Drawing the leveling phase map</h2>
			<p>The VSM team <a id="_idIndexMarker1080"/>now has the information they require to <a id="_idIndexMarker1081"/>develop the future state value stream map for the leveling phase. As with the other phases, the team evaluates leveling opportunities by working their way through a series of related question, as follows: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>What are the minimum work item group sizes for optimal flows? </li>
				<li>What type of Kanban signaling methods work in the value stream's work environment? (That is, Kanban Boards, Kanban Cards, Kanban bins, or Visual Pitch Board?)</li>
				<li>How will Kanban Cards or folders be distributed? (That is, manager distribution, Heijunka boxes, or Runners/handlers?)</li>
				<li>If appropriate, what type of Heijunka box or visual aid is required? (That is, showing work that's been assigned to value stream operators or by part type?)</li>
				<li>If runners are required, what route and pace should be optimal for leveling flows? </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Before drawing the leveling phase map, the VSM team should decide on what icons they plan to use to portray the production leveling requirements for FIFO, Runners, Heijunka boxes, Kanban Cards, Kanban folders, and Visual Pitch Boards. </p>
			<p>The VSM team <a id="_idIndexMarker1082"/>builds upon their previously <a id="_idIndexMarker1083"/>evaluated future state – continuous flows map to add the elements necessary for assisting with leveling the flows. In the previous continuous flows exercise, the VSM team assessed the need for a Kanban-based system to help establish better product flows. They have refined their thinking and have decided to implement a Kanban Board with sticky notes as the ideal signaling method. </p>
			<p>The following diagram shows the Kaizen Burst associated with implementing the Kanban Board-based leveling with sticky notes:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer104" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_09_21.jpg" alt="Figure 9.21 – The IT value stream future state map with Kanban Board-based leveling with sticky notes&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.21 – The IT value stream future state map with Kanban Board-based leveling with sticky notes</p>
			<p>The Kanban Board helps the <a id="_idIndexMarker1084"/>IT value stream manage the cadence of their flows while simultaneously leveling the WIP at any given time. The <a id="_idIndexMarker1085"/>developers still conduct Sprint planning sessions to refine user stories within the product backlog, and they work with the product owner to prioritize work items. </p>
			<p>Many of the selected items support development customer-requested enhancements. However, some user stories address issues of technical debt, security, and architectural and design improvements. The VSM team annotates the proposed change on their future state maps by adding the Kanban Board Icon at the development stage. The VSM team also adds an associated Kaizen Burst to indicate the continuous improvement activity. </p>
			<p>Throughout this chapter, we have discussed how to implement Lean-oriented concepts as an overlay to <a id="_idIndexMarker1086"/>software development practices. But if <a id="_idIndexMarker1087"/>the software development team has implemented Agile practices, we may have to undo some of the batch-oriented practices implemented by the Sprint Backlogs. Batch processing causes waste in the form of waiting and excess WIP. </p>
			<p>If a software development organization has implemented Agile practices around Scrum, they may want to address a change to Kanban-based production scheduling concepts during their future state mapping exercises. So, before we leave our future state mapping activities, let's take a moment to address how we can improve Agile-based practices to eliminate the negative aspects of batch processing work items across Sprints.  </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-217"><a id="_idTextAnchor266"/>Eliminating Agile-based batch processing</h2>
			<p>Sprint Backlogs are <a id="_idIndexMarker1088"/>inherently a batch <a id="_idIndexMarker1089"/>production process. The Agile teams pull work items as a "lot" from the product backlog and then hold them in a queue until the development team members have time to work on them. Queuing work items can lead to excessive waiting and WIP in queues, as well as task switching. All three practices are forms of waste.</p>
			<p>Some organizations implement Kanban Boards to both visualize and manage WIP within their Sprints. In this manner, Kanban Boards help the development team level production flows across each Sprint duration. </p>
			<p>However, Agile team implementations of Kanban Boards are not an example of a strategy that supports optimized continuous flows. The team is still moving work items across Sprints in lot sizes greater than one. However, with the implementation of CI/CD and DevOps pipelines, work items can flow as single-piece workflows across the value stream. Moreover, the development team can also use their Kanban Boards to level customer demand directly at the product backlog level, so long as the work items have been fully refined and prioritized.</p>
			<p>Yes, Lean can be made part of Scrum and other Agile practices. But it's important to understand that using Sprints as a mechanism to control the flow of requirements then becomes a batch process, which is inconsistent with Lean philosophies on implementing the ideal of single-piece flows. </p>
			<p>Does that mean that <a id="_idIndexMarker1090"/>Sprints and other forms of developing on cadence – such as in SAFe? In a word, no. Sprints and other <a id="_idIndexMarker1091"/>forms of development cadence force the value stream teams to take the time to plan their upcoming activities. The teams provide product and solution demos to customers and other stakeholders. They also inspect and adapt their work and perform Kaizen or Retrospective-based reflections to support their continuous improvement objectives.   </p>
			<p>This section completes our discussion on future state (phase 3) mapping to improve customer demand-flow leveling. Before we leave this section altogether, let's review the tools we identified that support leveling. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-218"><a id="_idTextAnchor267"/>Future state – leveling tools</h2>
			<p>In this section, you learned <a id="_idIndexMarker1092"/>who and when to employ a Kanban Board to <a id="_idIndexMarker1093"/>manage work in progress flowing across a value stream. Kanban Boards work well in IT-oriented value streams and in other administration or operations-oriented value streams. </p>
			<p>A value stream manager may employ a material handler or "Runner" to move materials and parts that must be manually moved across significant distances. The Runner can set the value stream's pace as they move the WIP components and production Kanban Cards or folders from one work location to another. The Runner follows the flow of the value stream, setting the cadence with each cycle they make. </p>
			<p>Heijunka boxes offer a method to store production Kanban Cards and folders in slots within a box. The Heijunka box serves as a visual aid indicating the day's scheduled work over specific periods of time. The Hiejunka box may indicate which individuals are responsible for performing the work, or the type of products to be manufactured. </p>
			<p>Another visual aid form is the <em class="italic">Visual Pitch Board</em>, which, like the Heijunka box, displays scheduled work overtime based on the value stream's pitch. But instead of placing the production Kanban folders in slots within a box, the value stream manager manually distributes the Cards and folders to the operators. </p>
			<p>As a quick aside, the <a id="_idIndexMarker1094"/>IT department may be asked to implement <a id="_idIndexMarker1095"/>electronic equivalents of the Kanban Boards, Heijunka box, and Visual Pitch Boards. In Part Two of this book, we will learn how VSM tools provide these capabilities.</p>
			<p>Finally, we need to update the VSM Storyboard with the future state map – leveling phase improvements. The VSM team needs to decide what icons they plan to use to indicate Kanban Boards, paced withdrawals, Heijunka boxes, Kanban folders or Cards, and Visual Pitch Boards.  </p>
			<p>This section completes our introduction to future state mapping, the sixth step in our VSM methodology. In the next chapter, you will learn how to implement Kaizen plans to guide your continuous improvement initiatives. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-219"><a id="_idTextAnchor268"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you learned about the three phases of future state value stream mapping. These phases include assessing the value stream's ability to manage customer demands, implement continuous flows, and level customer orders to optimize production capacities. In addition, you learned how to develop and evolve the future state map across these three phases.</p>
			<p>As part of your learning, this chapter continued with the original IT-oriented value stream example, to show you how the VSM team moves from the continuous state assessment of work and information flows to analyzing a preferred future state. You completed the exercise by noting that the Sprint-based practices of Agile and Scrum implement batch processes inherently, which is a form of waste in Lean. However, you now know that batch processing can be eliminated by moving to Kanban-based production scheduling, as well as by implementing integrated and automated CI/CD and DevOps pipeline flows.</p>
			<p>Having read this chapter, you now have the knowledge to evaluate and implement Lean improvements across value streams to address issues associated with aligning production with customer demand, improving continuous flows, and leveling production to meet variations in customer demand. With this information, you have developed improvement strategies in the form of discrete Kaizen Bursts. </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, you will learn how to create and implement Kaizen plans to execute your future state impro<a id="_idTextAnchor269"/>vement strategies. </p>

			<p>Please take a moment to answer the following questions to ensure you have a solid grasp of future state mapping:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">What are the three phases of future state value stream mapping?</li>
				<li>What is the goal of the customer demand phase?</li>
				<li>What is the goal of the continuous flow phase?</li>
				<li>What is the goal of the leveling phase?</li>
				<li>How is Takt time calculated, and what is its purpose?</li>
				<li>How is pitch calculated, and what is its purpose?</li>
				<li>What is a critical issue when you're managing customer demands across a value stream?</li>
				<li>What is the primary objective of phase 2 – continuous flow?</li>
				<li>In an ideal state, what is the objective of production leveling?</li>
				<li>Why do the iterative Agile and Scrum-based Sprints inherently implement batch-oriented processes, and how can those strategies be improved?</li>
