			<p>In the previous chapters, you learned how to conduct a VSM initiative, map the current state, and then map three phases of desired future states. At this point, the VSM team is ready to begin the improvement activities. VSM implements the Lean concepts of Kaizen to make continuous improvements. The VSM team now knows how to apply the VSM tools to make Lean improvements in their IT value streams and other organizational value streams.</p>
			<p>Lean improvements are distinctively different from Agile-based improvements in terms of scope of work, timeframes, costs, and authorities. In this chapter, you will learn that Lean improvements tend to address issues at a strategic level that require portfolio investments and executive-level decision making, at least initially. In contrast, Agile-based improvements tend to operate at a tactical level and within the Agile team's scope, and within shorter timeframes measured in individual Sprints.</p>
			<p>Both Lean and Agile practices are necessary and should be integrated within the organization. However, since this book is about value stream management, our focus is on making Lean-oriented value stream improvements, specifically across IT-oriented value streams.</p>
			<p>In our generic VSM methodology, there are three steps related to Kaizen: first, identifying the Kaizen bursts – as improvement opportunities – and then planning and implementing your Kaizen plans. You learned how to identify Kaizen opportunities in the previous chapters. This chapter provides instructions on constructing a Kaizen plan and how to implement it.</p>
			<p>Lean improvements are, at their root, business transformations. VSM initiatives help reengineer business processes to create value streams as Lean production flows. The word production flow does not always imply that products are developed for external customers. For example, some software-oriented value streams develop and deliver software products to support other internal business operations or operations-oriented value streams.</p>
			<p>We will cover all these topics in this chapter. Specifically, by the end of this chapter, you will be able to create and implement Kaizen plans as part of your Lean business transformation.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Combining Lean and Agile practices</li>
				<li>Making continuous Lean-Agile improvements</li>
				<li>Creating Kaizen plans – VSM step seven</li>
				<li>Implementing Kaizen plans – VSM step eight</li>
				<li>Summarizing the VSM methodology</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-223"><a id="_idTextAnchor273"/>Combining Lean and Agile practices</h1>
			<p>The current trend among Agile methodologists is to combine the software development concepts behind Agile with those associated with Lean production processes. The integration of <a id="_idIndexMarker1096"/>Lean and Agile practices became mainstream only after Mary and Tom Poppendieck promoted Lean as a component of Agile practices in their book, <em class="italic">Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit</em> (Poppendieck, 2003). The impact of their book was <a id="_idIndexMarker1097"/>significant, and most modern Agile methodologies, such as <strong class="bold">Scrum</strong>, <strong class="bold">Large Scale Scrum</strong> (<strong class="bold">LeSS</strong>), <strong class="bold">Discipline Agile </strong>(<strong class="bold">DA</strong>), and the <strong class="bold">Scale-Agile Framework®</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAFe®</strong>), now claim to have Lean underpinnings.</p>
			<p>Still, the concept <a id="_idIndexMarker1098"/>of Lean-Agile practices is relatively new as an IT discipline. Most of the so-called Lean-Agile methodologies do not promote nor teach <a id="_idIndexMarker1099"/>comprehensive methods to make Lean-oriented production improvements. Instead, most Lean-Agile methodologies state that Lean or Lean thinking principles are built into their methodologies.</p>
			<p>In other words, the methodologists who make such claims believe that merely following their practices can make organizations Lean. But, true or not, Lean practices are pretty evolved, and embedding Lean's concepts in other methodologies, without also implementing the discipline of value stream management, takes away from the rigor of its proven production and value delivery improvement methods.</p>
			<p>While both Agile and Lean practitioners promote the concepts of continuous improvements, there are fundamental differences in philosophies about the improvement <a id="_idIndexMarker1100"/>process, timeframes, and the scope of work involved. We'll take a look at these differences in the next section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-224"><a id="_idTextAnchor274"/>Making continuous Lean-Agile improvements</h1>
			<p>By now, it must be apparent to you that the organization's value stream management initiatives are not one-time events. Instead, they are ongoing and cyclical over the lifetime of <a id="_idIndexMarker1101"/>the product line. However, in this chapter, you will discover that many of the initial Lean improvement initiatives tend to have a larger scale than Agile-based continuous improvements associated with team-based retrospectives.</p>
			<p>That's not to say that Lean improvements can't be made on a small scale. Fundamentally, everyone in a Lean organization is encouraged to uncover problems that impede their ability to work, find solutions, and implement them. Still, agile teams and individuals typically cannot make wholesale changes to equipment and tools, nor can they procure new equipment and tools to improve continuous flows across the value stream, without formal approvals from their executives. Implementing large-scale improvements and business transformations are where the disciplines of Lean and VSM shine.</p>
			<p>Large-scale <a id="_idIndexMarker1102"/>IT value stream improvement issues manifest when an IT organization wants to implement a <strong class="bold">continuous integration/continuous delivery</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>) or DevOps pipeline. These investments are typically larger than an agile software development team, or even a software product team, has the authority to approve. For these reasons, the scope of change tends to be larger in Lean-oriented improvements than in Agile – at least in the early stages – so the timescales and investments tend to be larger.</p>
			<p>The goal of Lean-Agile is to combine the best of both worlds of doing business. Both concepts have more in common than not. For example, both the Agile and Lean concepts have a focus on delivering customer-centric value. Both concepts seek greater production efficiencies, improved quality, and rapid delivery. And, both concepts encourage continuous improvements.</p>
			<p>Agile, Scrum, and Lean all share the notion of continuously improving our operations. However, Lean practitioners employ value stream management practices to guide improvements, while Agile practitioners tend to use retrospectives.</p>
			<p>VSM implements a much more rigorous process for continuous improvements, called <strong class="bold">Kaizen</strong>, compared to <a id="_idIndexMarker1103"/>Agile-based Retrospectives. Lean's Kaizen-based improvements tend to look at the value stream holistically, from front to end, to make improvements across product and information flows. As a result, the scope of Kaizen-based improvements may span timeframes and investments beyond those that can be made at the small agile-team level.</p>
			<p>Put another way, sometimes, we need to tear complex things apart before figuring out how to put them back together as a better operating system. And because the investments are so significant, we need to prioritize each proposed change in terms of their contributions to delivering the most value in the shortest possible time.</p>
			<p>As we've worked through the continuous and future state mapping exercises for our IT value stream, we've identified many improvement opportunities. Specifically, the Kaizen Burst icons <a id="_idIndexMarker1104"/>highlight the improvement opportunities that were identified in our future state maps. Agile and Scrum practices seek incremental improvements based on assessments of real-time issues that need immediate attention. In contrast, value stream management takes a longer-term view to assess structural changes to organizations and work and information flows.</p>
			<p>The VSM team will work with the value stream operators and stakeholders to incrementally implement the recommended Kaizen improvements. Still, the planning horizon is much longer than those recommended in Agile and Scrum, at least during the initial VSM team engagement. Moreover, VSM improvements tend to be strategic, with investment decisions being made at the portfolio level.</p>
			<p>Both types of continuous improvement concepts, Agile and Lean, are essential. But as you discovered in <a href="B17087_05_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor126"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Driving Business Value through a DevOps Pipeline</em>, significant investments are required to achieve a Lean IT value stream across the development and operations departments. Such expensive improvements require executive-level buy-in and approvals, and it takes time and effort for the IT department to implement a mature DevOps capability.</p>
			<p>Now that you understand the different objectives in Lean versus Agile-based continuous improvements, we can move on and understand how to develop a VSM-based Kaizen plan.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-225"><a id="_idTextAnchor275"/>Creating Kaizen plans – VSM step seven</h1>
			<p>There is a real danger of failure when incrementally implementing a CI/CD or DevOps toolchain and <a id="_idIndexMarker1105"/>pipeline on an ad hoc basis. To start, executive managers may not fully understand the time and costs involved, and may resist when they see unexpected and unplanned <strong class="bold">Capital expenditure</strong> (<strong class="bold">CAPEX</strong>) requests that have been <a id="_idIndexMarker1106"/>sent to them for approval. The development and operations teams will become frustrated if their toolchain and platform requests are not approved. There are tools, as well as process integration and security issues, that must be addressed when developing the DevOps pipeline, and internal customers and stakeholders may have false expectations of how long the improvements may take.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">DevOps</strong> is a business <a id="_idIndexMarker1107"/>transformation activity. It's much more of a business process reengineering program than an incremental business process improvement initiative, and the DevOps initiative needs to be treated accordingly. In other words, DevOps is a strategic investment that must be planned and executed at the portfolio level. This means the VSM team must conduct rigorous planning, provide detailed budgets and schedules, and lay out a roadmap for its rollout to support the organization's other Lean value stream initiatives.</p>
			<p>In this section, you will learn how to build a Kaizen plan for your VSM initiative. So, let's get started.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-226"><a id="_idTextAnchor276"/>Connecting to a business strategy</h2>
			<p>With the completion of the three-phase future state mapping exercise, the VSM team has a broad <a id="_idIndexMarker1108"/>understanding of the improvements that need to be made. Now, the VSM team must learn how to implement the improvements, which requires a plan. </p>
			<p>It's not necessary to try to get the plan right and complete it at the start. It's better to start with what we know, find out what we don't know, and make informed improvements to the plan as the team goes along. Such an approach is consistent with Agile views on improving software. First, we must implement what we think our customers need and want. Then, we must show them what we have, and then take their feedback to make it better incrementally. The same strategy holds for Kaizen planning and implementation.</p>
			<p>At every phase of the VSM initiative, the team begins by asking a series of questions. The same strategy is valid for Kaizen planning. But this time, the VSM team's focus is on aligning improvement activities in the context of strategic intent. In other words, what are the goals <a id="_idIndexMarker1109"/>and objectives that have been set out by the organization's executives who approved the VSM initiative? Some such questions are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Who are the value stream's customers, and how will they benefit from the VSM improvements?</li>
				<li>How does this VSM initiative support the strategic goals of the organization?</li>
				<li>How was the VSM initiative cost justified as a high-priority portfolio investment? That is, what are the executive-level expectations that justified the investments?</li>
				<li>The VSM initiative supports which internal or external products?</li>
				<li>The VSM initiative impacts which internal and external organizations?</li>
				<li>What are the expected quality improvements for this initiative? </li>
				<li>How will the Lean IT value stream support the organization's other Lean value streams?</li>
				<li>Are there sections of the value stream where improvements have a bigger impact on the overall productivity of the system?<p>a. In other words, are there segments of the value stream that negatively impact the flow and throughput of the value stream as a whole?</p><p>b. Are there segments of linked activities across the value stream that can be combined into simpler, more efficient activities?</p></li>
				<li>How should we prioritize the stream improvement activities that were identified in the future state mapping exercise?</li>
				<li>What types of investments are required to implement each of the Kaizen improvement plans?</li>
				<li>What kind of training or skills are required to support each of the identified improvement recommendations? </li>
				<li>What is the optimal schedule for rolling out the identified Kaizen improvements?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It's essential <a id="_idIndexMarker1110"/>that the VSM team clearly defines the qualitative and quantitative metrics for all the preceding questions. Ultimately, these metrics define the effectiveness of each improvement action.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-227"><a id="_idTextAnchor277"/>Planning Lean improvements across phases</h2>
			<p>Just as the VSM team identified <strong class="bold">future state improvements</strong> across three phases, the improvement <a id="_idIndexMarker1111"/>plan's rollout should follow the same three phases. These phases are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sub-plans to meet <strong class="bold">customer demand</strong></li>
				<li>Sub-plans to improve the <strong class="bold">process flow</strong></li>
				<li>Sub-plans to <strong class="bold">level the work</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These three sub-plans map directly back to the future state Kaizen plans that were identified in the previous chapter (<a href="B17087_09_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor234"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Mapping the Future State (VSM Step 6)</em>). As a quick recap, future state mapping guides improvements across the following three phases:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer demand phase</strong>: Evaluates <a id="_idIndexMarker1112"/>customer demands for products, work items, and services, including customer-driven variations in quality, features, or functions, and lead times.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Continuous flow phase</strong>: Seeks <a id="_idIndexMarker1113"/>to improve production flows to match customer demands.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Leveling phase</strong>: Implements strategies to distribute work, both by volume and <a id="_idIndexMarker1114"/>variety, to reduce bottlenecks and waiting, and to minimize lot sizes. Recalling that the ideal is a lot size of one.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Don't <a id="_idIndexMarker1115"/>forget that the VSM team identified multiple improvement opportunities for each phase. Therefore, the Kaizen plan should address all the recommended improvement initiatives across each phase.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-228"><a id="_idTextAnchor278"/>Developing Kaizen plans</h2>
			<p>Again, unlike the Agile concepts of identifying and implementing improvements across every <strong class="bold">Sprint</strong>, the Lean improvements will likely take months to roll out. A primary reason for this <a id="_idIndexMarker1116"/>is the need to identify the investments needed to make the necessary tools, equipment, and layout changes, gain executive approvals, and fit them within a portfolio budget cycle.</p>
			<p>The proposed changes will likewise require time to design and then procure, deploy, and test the necessary tools, platforms, and equipment. The VSM team cannot forget the need to bring the organization's human talent up to speed on the changes. The Kaizen plan should include <strong class="bold">time</strong> and <strong class="bold">resources</strong> for mentoring, coaching, and training. In this section, you will learn how to develop a Kaizen plan using three primary tools; namely, the Monthly Kaizen Schedule Plan, the Chart of VSM Objectives and Measurables, and the Detailed Monthly Kaizen Schedule Plan.</p>
			<p>If the VSM team prefers, they can use a project management scheduling tool, such as MS Project, to develop a <strong class="bold">Gannt chart</strong> of the Kaizen schedule. But a simple worksheet or large whiteboard is more than sufficient to create a <strong class="bold">Monthly Kaizen Schedule Plan</strong>.</p>
			<p>The following figure shows an example of a Monthly Kaizen Schedule Plan as an Excel worksheet. This worksheet visually displays the planned improvement initiatives for each of the Kaizen Bursts across each of the three phases of future state improvements. In addition, the VSM team updates the Monthly Kaizen Plan Worksheet with new proposed improvement initiatives that have been identified over time:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer106" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_10.1.jpg" alt="Figure 10.1 – Monthly Kaizen Schedule Plan &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.1 – Monthly Kaizen Schedule Plan </p>
			<p>The Monthly Kaizen Plan Worksheet is an overview of planned Lean improvement initiatives; therefore, they it does not provide much detail on the tasks associated with each Lean improvement <a id="_idIndexMarker1117"/>initiative. As planning progresses, more details are exposed, and the VSM team uses a different visual display to track those <a id="_idIndexMarker1118"/>details and inform others of their progress. The detailed plan <a id="_idIndexMarker1119"/>may be called a <strong class="bold">Kaizen Milestone Chart</strong> or <strong class="bold">Monthly Kaizen Schedule</strong>.</p>
			<p>On an ongoing basis, the VSM team uses the symbols depicted at the bottom of the Monthly Kaizen Schedule Plan (<em class="italic">Figure 10.1</em>) to update the status of each Kaizen Burst within its calendar fields.</p>
			<p>Another essential visual display is a chart showing <strong class="bold">Lean measurables</strong>, including baselines <a id="_idIndexMarker1120"/>and target values, objectives, goals, the state of the proposed change, and identified risks and issues. It is called the <strong class="bold">Chart of VSM Objectives and Measurables</strong>, and the purpose of this chart is to provide a highly visible display of improvement objectives, goals, and metrics for the VSM initiative. It also identifies risks and issues associated with each recommended improvement objective.</p>
			<p>The following figure shows an example of a Chart of VSM Objectives and Measurables.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer107" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_10.2.jpg" alt="Figure 10.2 – Chart of VSM Objectives and Measurables&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.2 – Chart of VSM Objectives and Measurables</p>
			<p>Note that risks and issues are broken out separately. The reason for this is that, by definition, <em class="italic">Risks</em> are events that might happen, while <em class="italic">Issues</em> are problems that have already impacted our project. The difference is vital because the VSM teams should identify <a id="_idIndexMarker1121"/>potential risks before they happen and decide what steps become necessary to avoid or mitigate the risks' negative impacts. Also, the VSM team should define contingency plans for the worst potential risks so that they already have a plan in place to minimize the impacts if they happen.</p>
			<p>For example, let's say <a id="_idIndexMarker1122"/>the VSM team recommends adopting a new <strong class="bold">source code management</strong> (<strong class="bold">SCM</strong>) repository and continuous integration tools. If something happens with the install, we want to have a backup and restore capability as a contingency plan, to roll back our original environments and data until we figure out what caused our new system changeover to fail.</p>
			<p>The detailed monthly Kaizen plan includes the same elements as the Monthly Kaizen Schedule Plan, such as phase, planned tasks, and months. But the detailed Schedule Plan should include additional information, such as ownership assignments, estimated time to completion, and whether the task is past due. It also provides a more granular display of time over units of weeks, not months. The <em class="italic">State of Change</em> fields are updated with the symbols that were identified at the bottom of the Chart of VSM Objectives and Measurables (<em class="italic">Figure 10.2</em>).</p>
			<p>The following figure provides an example display of a <strong class="bold">Detailed Monthly Kaizen Schedule Plan</strong>. As the name implies, this plan aims to learn about the proposed VSM improvement <a id="_idIndexMarker1123"/>activities. Specifically, the plan provides <a id="_idIndexMarker1124"/>space for identifying all the improvement initiatives, down to the task level:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer108" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_10.3.jpg" alt="Figure 10.3 – Detailed Monthly Kaizen Schedule Plan&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.3 – Detailed Monthly Kaizen Schedule Plan</p>
			<p>The Detailed <a id="_idIndexMarker1125"/>Monthly Kaizen Schedule Plan includes a <strong class="bold">Task No</strong> for each recommended improvement objective, again down to the task level. Descriptive Task<strong class="bold">Names</strong> highlight the work involved, and the plan should identify who is responsible for completing work and whether goals have been achieved. A timeline provides a visual display of <strong class="bold">Start Date, Ongoing work, and Completed dates</strong>. The VSM team should also make annotations to indicate when planned tasks are <strong class="bold">Past Due</strong>.</p>
			<p>Milestones mark the start or completion of major events, using the symbols identified at the bottom of the Detailed Monthly Kaizen Schedule Plan (<em class="italic">Figure 10.3</em>). So, for each improvement activity, the VSM team identifies important events to measure the start, progress, and completion of their change initiatives. All milestones must be quantifiable in terms of the change objectives and measurable in terms of the extent of the activity's completion of stated objectives.</p>
			<p>It's important to understand that VSM initiatives are project-based work and not based on Agile-based development strategies. That's not to say that VSM initiatives are incompatible with Lean practices. Still, Agile-based Retrospectives tend to be limited in time and scope of the authorities of the small agile team and within the duration of a Sprint.</p>
			<p>In contrast, Lean initiatives tend to take a longer-term planning horizon, involve much larger investments that require executive-level buy-in and sponsorship, and tend to be more aligned with supporting corporate strategies.</p>
			<p>VSM initiatives <a id="_idIndexMarker1126"/>are tasked with identifying critical changes that are necessary to implement and improve lean practices across a value stream. The scope of work and investments are approved at an executive level and directly impact the organization's ability to meet its strategic goals.</p>
			<p>In this context, VSM initiatives have the characteristics of a project. In other words, they have a defined scope of work, a defined set of deliverable tasks, a defined budget, and a defined schedule. However, the continuous improvement efforts will move to the Agile teams as part of their normal Sprint Retrospectives in the long run. With these initial Lean transformations completed and installed on an Agile-based framework, the <strong class="bold">IT-oriented</strong> value streams reform as Lean-Agile practices.</p>
			<p>Now that the VSM team has created their Kaizen plans, they need to obtain approvals to proceed. This approval requirement is the topic of the following subsection.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-229"><a id="_idTextAnchor279"/>Obtaining approvals to proceed </h2>
			<p>As noted previously, Lean improvement initiatives often involve significant investments. But they <a id="_idIndexMarker1127"/>also have the potential for disrupting the value stream's day-to-day activities. Therefore, the VSM team must seek and obtain appropriate approvals before starting a new change initiative.</p>
			<p>Note that this level of approval does not generally apply to Agile-based continuous improvement activities as they tend to focus on procedural changes at a local level. But given the time, resources, and investments associated with the larger VSM initiative, executive-level approvals are necessary.</p>
			<p>The VSM <a id="_idIndexMarker1128"/>team can use its <strong class="bold">VSM storyboard</strong> and <strong class="bold">Kaizen plans</strong> to summarize <a id="_idIndexMarker1129"/>its lean transformation concepts. During the executive-level review, the VSM team should be prepared to answer the following questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How does this project relate to the organization's strategic objectives?</li>
				<li>Why did the VSM team select this value stream, linked value streams, or aportion of a value stream for this Lean improvement initiative?</li>
				<li>What impact will the lean methods have on our internal and external customers?</li>
				<li>What throughput changes are expected?</li>
				<li>What product quality improvements are expected?</li>
				<li>What cost savings are expected, and over what timeframe?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Hopefully, the executive team was involved in the early planning sessions and formally sponsored <a id="_idIndexMarker1130"/>the VSM team, complete with a defined <strong class="bold">charter</strong> to authorize their time and resources. However, it never hurts to remind the executives about the purpose and goals of the VSM initiative, and how the team's work maps back to supporting the organization's strategic goals and mission.</p>
			<p>The VSM team's recommendations may sound overly aggressive and costly at first glance. The team must be prepared to back up their recommendations with sound logic, accurate data, and a risk-averse Kaizen strategy. As the VSM team prepares their presentation, they should keep the following in mind:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Set realistic goals and estimated completion dates.</li>
				<li>Engage in open dialogue with executives, value stream managers, operators, and other critical stakeholders to obtain their buy-in before giving the formal presentation.</li>
				<li>Show draft VSM presentations and maps to everyone connected to the value stream and get their input.</li>
				<li>Keep the main presentation minimal, with bullets outlining key points, but have detailed slides available to get into the necessary details.</li>
				<li>Make the presentation visual with graphical and large- font presentation slides, plus a large display of the VSM storyboard.</li>
				<li>Ensure excellent work is recognized, including VSM team members', VA operators', and other vital stakeholders' work.</li>
				<li>Take the time to celebrate after getting approval, and then celebrate again after each successful Lean improvement initiative.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is all you need to know about Kaizen planning. If you are already familiar with Agile concepts, you know that detailed project and schedule plans in IT don't make sense. Until we start <a id="_idIndexMarker1131"/>working with our value stream customers, we can't know what solutions are best or optimal. Moreover, needs and priorities change over time, making detailed plans obsolete even before we begin our work. The better option is to get your basic VSM plan together, move forward with it, and then iteratively and incrementally improve it over time as you work to improve the value stream.</p>
			<p>This section concludes our discussion on Kaizen planning. In the next section, you will learn how to implement Kaizen plans.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-230"><a id="_idTextAnchor280"/>Implementing Kaizen plans – VSM step eight</h1>
			<p>In this section, you will learn how to implement your Kaizen plans. This last step is also the <a id="_idIndexMarker1132"/>shortest VSM method to describe but arguably the most critical step and the lengthiest activity – it lasts the value stream's lifetime. As with Agile, in Lean practices, we never stop our efforts to improve.</p>
			<p>This VSM step is also the most difficult to implement. The reason for this is that many, if not most, people are naturally resistant to change. The success of the VSM team's Lean improvement recommendations depends on their ability to get folks to buy in across the organization. You must begin this step by addressing the issue of change.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-231"><a id="_idTextAnchor281"/>Addressing the issue of change</h2>
			<p>Obtaining organizational buy-in to implement the VSM team's recommendations won't happen <a id="_idIndexMarker1133"/>overnight. It's best to work with a highly motivated value stream team who willingly serve as <strong class="bold">innovators</strong> and <strong class="bold">early adopters</strong> in the organization's Lean enterprise initiatives.</p>
			<p>Unlike the original goals of business process reengineering, the VSM team should not implement its recommendations all at once. The only justification for doing so is if the organization is in a <strong class="bold">burning platform</strong> situation, where delays lead to the organization's bankruptcy or failure. Instead, the VSM team needs to work through its identified Kaizen Bursts, implementing changes iteratively and incrementally. This does not mean that the process should be unduly extended over time. The goal is to have rapid successes and use those early, and then use rapid-following successes to communicate the overall VSM initiative's value.</p>
			<p>Following the <em class="italic">technology adoption life cycle</em> principles, initially outlined by Joe Bohlen and George Beal in their paper titled <em class="italic">The Diffusion Process</em>, the remainder of the organization's members will follow the new practices once they are convinced of the benefits of the change. The following figure provides a graphical depiction of the typical technology or product adoption curve:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer109" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_10.4.jpg" alt="Figure 10.4 – Technology adoption curve&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.4 – Technology adoption curve</p>
			<p>The technology adoption life cycle is a sociological model that describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation. When you look at the Bell Curve shown in the preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker1134"/>figure, you will notice that labels have been placed across the curve: <strong class="bold">Innovators, Ealy Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, and Laggards</strong>. Let's take a moment to understand what these labels imply:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Innovators</strong>: They are the first within an industry or an organization to implement new methods, tools, and operating models. They tend to like change and are less risk averse. In some situations, they may be in crisis mode (that is, burning platform) and have no choice but to change the way they do things.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Early Adopters</strong>: They are the first to see the benefits derived by the innovators and quickly adopt the new ways of working. They also tend to be open to change and take on some risk, but they won't be the first to move.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Early Majority</strong>: At this phase of a technology or business transformation life cycle change, things begin to take off. Enough people have paved the way to prove the benefits of the new technology or approach to work, and more people feel comfortable with the risks of adopting the new approach.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Late Majority</strong>: These are among the most risk-averse and conservative people, who wait until the momentum for change is so great that the new approach is the way of doing things.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Laggards</strong>: These people don't like change at all, may not be well informed, or may simply lack the resources to make the change. Therefore, they are the last to make changes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>While the innovators and early adopters lead the change, the change sticks within the organization when the early majority, late majority, and laggards see that the benefits outweigh the risks and accept the new way of doing business. </p>
			<p>So, by now, you are probably wondering how to kick off a new Lean change initiative. The answer is that it's not so much a process as it is a checklist of potential change support actions, as described in the following list:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Communicate reasons and intent every step of the way.</li>
				<li>Understand that those closest to the work often have good ideas of what needs to be fixed, why, and how.</li>
				<li>Address any personnel issues or inappropriate behaviors immediately.</li>
				<li>Reward and recognize the people supporting the VSM initiative.</li>
				<li>Resolve impediments and issues – and don't let them stop you.</li>
				<li>Don't be afraid to experiment to discover improved operating models.</li>
				<li>Executive sponsors and the VSM team need to be accessible, flexible, and willing to listen to input from value stream operators and stakeholders, while also staying focused on the Lean improvement goals.</li>
				<li>When making incremental changes, the positive effects are accumulative.</li>
				<li>Remember, we are in this for the long haul.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker1135"/>you have a strategy to deal with the human aspects of change, let's break down the implementation strategy.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-232"><a id="_idTextAnchor282"/>Guiding Lean business transformations</h2>
			<p>As noted in the introduction to this chapter, Lean is about making large-scale business transformations to improve value delivery, and then continuing to make improvements across <a id="_idIndexMarker1136"/>entire value streams across the organization's lifetime. Technically, there are three phases for coordinating the work when making Lean business transformations: <strong class="bold">preparation</strong>, <strong class="bold">implementation</strong>, and <strong class="bold">follow-up</strong>.</p>
			<p>We addressed the issues of preparation in the previous section on Kaizen planning. Implementation is <em class="italic">where the rubber meets the road,</em> and it's time to make changes. Following this, it should make sense that the VSM team needs to follow up to ensure that the changes stick. Moreover, the VSM team also needs to ensure that the value stream achieves the goals and metrics that justify Lean improvement investments.</p>
			<p>Remember that Lean continuous improvement efforts are distinctive from Agile-based continuous improvement activities. Lean focuses on long-term planning and investments that make the organization tough to beat in competitive markets. On the other hand, Agile-based Retrospectives tend to be localized, relatively small, typically don't involve investments, and are implemented across very short iterations.</p>
			<p>With its Lean improvement orientation, the objective of VSM is to eliminate all forms of waste. The goal is to help the VSM team build value streams that are efficient, responsive, and value-added from the customer's perspective. However, leveraging Pareto's principle, we know that each improvement simply elevates other issues to the top of the list. Each new Lean improvement moves the value stream in the direction of providing exceptional service to its customers.</p>
			<p>VSM <a id="_idIndexMarker1137"/>initiatives are big-picture improvement activities that are implemented incrementally and continuously. The VSM team uses their storyboard to guide their activities and explain to other stakeholders how the structured value stream management process improves value delivery.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-233"><a id="_idTextAnchor283"/>Decomposing Lean improvement work</h2>
			<p>Through each of the three future state phases of demand, continuous flow, and leveling improvements, the VSM team focuses on making the improvements that were identified in the Kaizen Bursts. The improvement activities within each Kaizen Burst can be <a id="_idIndexMarker1138"/>relatively small or very large initiatives, with multiple tasks and potentially involving significant investments.</p>
			<p>The purpose of breaking down the work involved in each Kaizen improvement activity as events is to fully expose the necessary work and get all relevant stakeholders involved in the assessment. The VSM team may choose to employ the <em class="italic">User Story</em> format, as described in the Kanban Board section in the Leveling Phase, to express each Kaizen event's goals and objectives. These Kaizen events can be likened to work items in a Product backlog. </p>
			<p>In fact, in an IT value stream, the Kaizen events can be included in a product backlog as the improvement work likely involves the value stream's operators' efforts. It's also possible to use a Kanban Board to manage and display the flow of work on the larger VSM initiatives across Kaizen Bursts and events.</p>
			<p>Whichever method you choose for managing Kaizen events, there is additional information that the VSM team must gather and communicate. To do so, apply the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Identify the objectives of the Kaizen event and communicate them.</li>
				<li>Identify the roles and responsibilities of the people who have been assigned to support the Kaizen events.</li>
				<li>Define the scope of the team's efforts; that is, perhaps via a story or in Epic format.</li>
				<li>Identify any training or information needs to support the Kaizen event.</li>
				<li>Display the Kaizen event's projected start and completion dates on the Detailed Monthly Kaizen Schedule Plan as Milestones.</li>
				<li>Identify potential risks and issues, and form mitigation strategies and contingency plans as appropriate.</li>
				<li>Plan and coordinate the work necessary to complete the Kaizen event.</li>
				<li>Seek executive-level support and approvals if additional investments or resources are required than what was initially conceived. </li>
				<li>Update the VSM team charter if any new team members are required to support the effort.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Again, some Kaizen events are simpler to plan and execute than others. So, do just enough <a id="_idIndexMarker1139"/>preparation and planning work to get things moving in the right direction. But also know that your understanding of what needs to be done improves over time through trial and error.</p>
			<p>In the longer run, the VSM team needs to be prepared to revisit their value stream maps' currency and update them accordingly. The Gemba walks never stop. Value stream improvements never stop. Each Kaizen event requires a total VSM team and executive-level commitment to the initiative from start to finish. Otherwise, the work will lag and may not be completed.</p>
			<p>This section completes our discussion on implementing our Kaizen plans to install Lean improvements across a value stream. But before we leave the topic of Kaizen, let's spend <a id="_idIndexMarker1140"/>a few moments discussing why VSM initiatives require executive approvals as portfolio-level investments.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-234"><a id="_idTextAnchor284"/>Managing VSM initiatives as portfolio-level investments</h2>
			<p>The VSM team and its sponsoring executives need to be patient in their efforts. VSM initiatives <a id="_idIndexMarker1141"/>involve large-scale business transformations to implement Lean product and information flows. The business transformation to Lean may require months or even years to complete. The objective is to give the VSM team the time and resources to work their way through at least one VSM iteration across all three phases of the future state improvement activities (that is, demand, continuous flow, and leveling).</p>
			<p>Once a VSM future-state value delivery improvement cycle completes, it may make sense for the VSM team to move on and support Lean improvement efforts in another value stream. The organization's executives must continuously support efforts to evaluate Lean improvement opportunities across the enterprise and align investment priorities as part of their portfolio planning activities. Larger organizations may have multiple VSM initiatives ongoing at any given time.</p>
			<p>All VSM initiatives cost money, take time and resources, and require investments. Without sufficient frontend analysis, the organization's executives can't know how best to deploy their <a id="_idIndexMarker1142"/>scarce resources for maximum gain. This issue is why <a id="_idIndexMarker1143"/>modern Lean-Agile practices, such as <strong class="bold">Disciplined Agile</strong> and the <strong class="bold">Scaled-Agile Framework</strong><strong class="bold">®</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAFe®</strong>), implement rigorous portfolio analysis techniques in their toolkits and methodologies.</p>
			<p>Since they lack a Lean-Agile framework, the VSM team must align their activities with the organization's Portfolio Management priorities and seek investments through the Portfolio management process. Lacking a formalized portfolio management process, the VSM team must work with their executives to establish a formal mechanism to review the team's Lean investment strategies and priorities. Without such approvals, there is no practical way forward to implement the identified Lean improvements.</p>
			<p>As with the other sections related to the eight VSM steps, we'll conclude our discussion of Kaizen with a subsection that summarizes the tools used to support the Kaizen implementation activities.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-235"><a id="_idTextAnchor285"/>Leveraging the tools of Kaizen</h2>
			<p>If your VSM team is sticking with a manual system, the Kaizen implementation tools are the <a id="_idIndexMarker1144"/>same as those used in the Kaizen planning and value stream mapping phases. The difference is that now, the tools serve as aids to implement the change processes. The VS methods and tools you've learned about can be used to improve Lean practices across development- and operations-oriented value streams.</p>
			<p>The tools that support your Kaizen planning and implementation activities include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>VSM Storyboard</li>
				<li>Current and future state value stream maps</li>
				<li>Monthly Kaizen Schedule Plan</li>
				<li>Chart of VSM Objectives and Measurables</li>
				<li>Detailed Monthly Kaizen Schedule Plan</li>
			</ul>
			<p>With what you have learned in <a href="B17087_06_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Launching the VSM Initiative (VSM Steps 1-3)</em>, through <a href="B17087_10_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor272"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Improving the Lean-Agile Value Delivery Cycle(VSM Steps 7 and 8)</em>, you have the practical knowledge to initiate and conduct a VSM initiative to implement Lean improvements across a value stream. In the remainder of <em class="italic">Section 2</em> of this book, on <em class="italic">Implementing Value Stream Management (VSM) Methods and Tools</em>, we will turn our attention to understanding how modern VSM tools support CI/CD and DevOps pipeline development and improvement activities. Before we get to the remaining chapters, let's quickly review the VSM methodology.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-236"><a id="_idTextAnchor286"/>Reviewing the VSM methodology</h1>
			<p>Throughout <a href="B17087_04_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor104"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Defining Value Stream Management</em>, and <a href="B17087_06_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Launching the VSM Initiative (VSM Steps 1-3)</em>, this <a id="_idIndexMarker1145"/>book introduced value stream management by applying an eight-step process that collectively defines a proven VSM through a generic methodology. For example, this eight-step VSM methodology has proven to work in manufacturing, office administration, supply chains, and health care applications and industries.</p>
			<p>The eight steps are as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Commit to Lean</li>
				<li>Choose the value stream</li>
				<li>Learn about Lean</li>
				<li>Map the current state</li>
				<li>Identify Lean metrics</li>
				<li>Map the future state</li>
				<li>Create Kaizen plans</li>
				<li>Implement Kaizen plans</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This eight-step VSM methodology works in IT-oriented value streams too, as shown in the CI/CD pipeline use case provided throughout this part of this book. The IT-oriented VSM use <a id="_idIndexMarker1146"/>case is purposely limited in complexity to focus on learning the VSM methodology. But the choice to use an IT-oriented use case was not by accident, as modern value stream management tools support implementing Lean practices across IT-oriented value streams. </p>
			<p>Still, it does not make sense to employ multiple VSM methodologies across an organization when one will do. Each VSM team should feel free to modify the baseline VSM/Lean improvement strategy to improve its effectiveness in their unique environments. Moreover, in a digital economy, every VSM initiative across an enterprise likely requires support from the organization's IT department somehow.</p>
			<p>In the previous chapters, a comment was made that DevOps capabilities are the "table stakes" necessary to compete in our modern digital economy. As a result, most modern VSM tools support the implementation, integration, and improvement of DevOps capabilities. But those same tool vendors note that VSM with DevOps also supports the organization's Lean improvement objectives. Thus, DevOps is a crucial enabler for adding value to whatever products and services the organization produces.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-237"><a id="_idTextAnchor287"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This chapter discussed the importance of continuously improving our value stream work and information flow capabilities. You learned that VSM and Agile share this principle, but their timelines and scope of effort are different. For example, Agile teams use Retrospectives to evaluate relatively small-scale improvements they can make over the next Sprint.</p>
			<p>In contrast, VSM teams focus their efforts on more significant and Lean-oriented improvement initiatives that span lengthier timeframes and require larger investments. In addition, Agile teams' continuous improvements typically do not require executive management-level approval; VSM team improvement recommendations nearly always do.</p>
			<p>Continuing with our eight-step VSM methodology, you learned how to create a Kaizen plan (VSM step seven) and implement the Kaizen plan (VSM step eight). You also learned how to develop and use several tools to plan and implement your Kaizen plans, such as the Monthly Kaizen Schedule Plan, the Chart of VSM Objectives and Measurables, and the Detailed Monthly Kaizen Schedule Plan.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, you will learn how VSM tools support Lean improvements being made across DevOps pipelines by providing real-time access to critical IT value stream data, dashboard-based visualizations, and metrics. VSM tools help DevOps team members and other stakeholders monitor and improve the flow of information and work across IT value streams and focus on customers.</p>
