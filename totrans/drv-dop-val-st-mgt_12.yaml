    current state, and then map three phases of desired future states. At this point,
    the VSM team is ready to begin the improvement activities. VSM implements the
    Lean concepts of Kaizen to make continuous improvements. The VSM team now knows
    how to apply the VSM tools to make Lean improvements in their IT value streams
    and other organizational value streams.

    in terms of scope of work, timeframes, costs, and authorities. In this chapter,
    you will learn that Lean improvements tend to address issues at a strategic level
    that require portfolio investments and executive-level decision making, at least
    initially. In contrast, Agile-based improvements tend to operate at a tactical
    level and within the Agile team's scope, and within shorter timeframes measured
    in individual Sprints.

    help reengineer business processes to create value streams as Lean production
    flows. The word production flow does not always imply that products are developed

    and deliver software products to support other internal business operations or
    operations-oriented value streams.

    initiatives are not one-time events. Instead, they are ongoing and cyclical over
    the lifetime of the product line. However, in this chapter, you will discover

- en: That's not to say that Lean improvements can't be made on a small scale. Fundamentally,
    everyone in a Lean organization is encouraged to uncover problems that impede
    their ability to work, find solutions, and implement them. Still, agile teams
    and individuals typically cannot make wholesale changes to equipment and tools,
    nor can they procure new equipment and tools to improve continuous flows across
    the value stream, without formal approvals from their executives. Implementing
    large-scale improvements and business transformations are where the disciplines
    of Lean and VSM shine.
  prefs: []

    wants to implement a **continuous integration/continuous delivery** (**CI/CD**)
    or DevOps pipeline. These investments are typically larger than an agile software
    development team, or even a software product team, has the authority to approve.
    For these reasons, the scope of change tends to be larger in Lean-oriented improvements
    than in Agile – at least in the early stages – so the timescales and investments
    tend to be larger.

    concepts encourage continuous improvements.

    **Kaizen**, compared to Agile-based Retrospectives. Lean's Kaizen-based improvements
    tend to look at the value stream holistically, from front to end, to make improvements
    across product and information flows. As a result, the scope of Kaizen-based improvements
    may span timeframes and investments beyond those that can be made at the small
    agile-team level.

    the Kaizen Burst icons highlight the improvement opportunities that were identified
    in our future state maps. Agile and Scrum practices seek incremental improvements
    based on assessments of real-time issues that need immediate attention. In contrast,
    value stream management takes a longer-term view to assess structural changes
    to organizations and work and information flows.

    with Agile concepts, you know that detailed project and schedule plans in IT don't
    make sense. Until we start working with our value stream customers, we can't know
    what solutions are best or optimal. Moreover, needs and priorities change over
    time, making detailed plans obsolete even before we begin our work. The better
    option is to get your basic VSM plan together, move forward with it, and then
    iteratively and incrementally improve it over time as you work to improve the
    value stream.

    so is if the organization is in a **burning platform** situation, where delays
    lead to the organization's bankruptcy or failure. Instead, the VSM team needs
    to work through its identified Kaizen Bursts, implementing changes iteratively
    and incrementally. This does not mean that the process should be unduly extended
    over time. The goal is to have rapid successes and use those early, and then use
    rapid-following successes to communicate the overall VSM initiative's value.

    VSM initiatives involve large-scale business transformations to implement Lean
    product and information flows. The business transformation to Lean may require
    months or even years to complete. The objective is to give the VSM team the time
    and resources to work their way through at least one VSM iteration across all
    three phases of the future state improvement activities (that is, demand, continuous
    flow, and leveling).

    priorities as part of their portfolio planning activities. Larger organizations
    may have multiple VSM initiatives ongoing at any given time.
