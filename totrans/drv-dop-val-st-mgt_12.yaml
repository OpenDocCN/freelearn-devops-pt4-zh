    current state, and then map three phases of desired future states. At this point,
    the VSM team is ready to begin the improvement activities. VSM implements the
    Lean concepts of Kaizen to make continuous improvements. The VSM team now knows
    how to apply the VSM tools to make Lean improvements in their IT value streams
    and other organizational value streams.

  zh: 在前面的章节中，你已经学习了如何开展VSM（价值流管理）计划，绘制当前状态图，并绘制三个阶段的理想未来状态。此时，VSM团队已经准备好开始改进活动。VSM实施了Kaizen（持续改进）理念，以实现持续的改进。VSM团队现在知道如何应用VSM工具，在他们的IT价值流和其他组织价值流中进行精益改进。
- en: Lean improvements are distinctively different from Agile-based improvements
    in terms of scope of work, timeframes, costs, and authorities. In this chapter,
    you will learn that Lean improvements tend to address issues at a strategic level
    that require portfolio investments and executive-level decision making, at least
    initially. In contrast, Agile-based improvements tend to operate at a tactical
    level and within the Agile team's scope, and within shorter timeframes measured
    in individual Sprints.

    identifying the Kaizen bursts – as improvement opportunities – and then planning

- en: Lean improvements are, at their root, business transformations. VSM initiatives
    help reengineer business processes to create value streams as Lean production
    flows. The word production flow does not always imply that products are developed
    for external customers. For example, some software-oriented value streams develop
    and deliver software products to support other internal business operations or
    operations-oriented value streams.

    everyone in a Lean organization is encouraged to uncover problems that impede

    nor can they procure new equipment and tools to improve continuous flows across

    continuous improvement activities. Lean focuses on long-term planning and investments
    that make the organization tough to beat in competitive markets. On the other
    hand, Agile-based Retrospectives tend to be localized, relatively small, typically
    don't involve investments, and are implemented across very short iterations.

    all forms of waste. The goal is to help the VSM team build value streams that
    are efficient, responsive, and value-added from the customer's perspective. However,
    leveraging Pareto's principle, we know that each improvement simply elevates other
    issues to the top of the list. Each new Lean improvement moves the value stream
    in the direction of providing exceptional service to its customers.

    of work on the larger VSM initiatives across Kaizen Bursts and events.

    VSM initiatives involve large-scale business transformations to implement Lean
    product and information flows. The business transformation to Lean may require
    months or even years to complete. The objective is to give the VSM team the time
    and resources to work their way through at least one VSM iteration across all
    three phases of the future state improvement activities (that is, demand, continuous
    flow, and leveling).

- en: Once a VSM future-state value delivery improvement cycle completes, it may make
    sense for the VSM team to move on and support Lean improvement efforts in another
    value stream. The organization's executives must continuously support efforts
    to evaluate Lean improvement opportunities across the enterprise and align investment
    priorities as part of their portfolio planning activities. Larger organizations
    may have multiple VSM initiatives ongoing at any given time.
  id: totrans-166

- en: All VSM initiatives cost money, take time and resources, and require investments.
    Without sufficient frontend analysis, the organization's executives can't know
    how best to deploy their scarce resources for maximum gain. This issue is why
    modern Lean-Agile practices, such as **Disciplined Agile** and the **Scaled-Agile
    Framework****®** (**SAFe®**), implement rigorous portfolio analysis techniques
    in their toolkits and methodologies.
  id: totrans-167

    with the organization's Portfolio Management priorities and seek investments through
    the Portfolio management process. Lacking a formalized portfolio management process,
    the VSM team must work with their executives to establish a formal mechanism to
    review the team's Lean investment strategies and priorities. Without such approvals,
    there is no practical way forward to implement the identified Lean improvements.

    practical knowledge to initiate and conduct a VSM initiative to implement Lean
    improvements across a value stream. In the remainder of *Section 2* of this book,
    on *Implementing Value Stream Management (VSM) Methods and Tools*, we will turn
    our attention to understanding how modern VSM tools support CI/CD and DevOps pipeline
    development and improvement activities. Before we get to the remaining chapters,
    let's quickly review the VSM methodology.

    management by applying an eight-step process that collectively defines a proven
    VSM through a generic methodology. For example, this eight-step VSM methodology
    has proven to work in manufacturing, office administration, supply chains, and
    health care applications and industries.

    in the CI/CD pipeline use case provided throughout this part of this book. The
    IT-oriented VSM use case is purposely limited in complexity to focus on learning
    the VSM methodology. But the choice to use an IT-oriented use case was not by
    accident, as modern value stream management tools support implementing Lean practices
    across IT-oriented value streams.

    organization when one will do. Each VSM team should feel free to modify the baseline
    VSM/Lean improvement strategy to improve its effectiveness in their unique environments.
    Moreover, in a digital economy, every VSM initiative across an enterprise likely
    requires support from the organization's IT department somehow.

    "table stakes" necessary to compete in our modern digital economy. As a result,
    most modern VSM tools support the implementation, integration, and improvement
    of DevOps capabilities. But those same tool vendors note that VSM with DevOps
    also supports the organization's Lean improvement objectives. Thus, DevOps is
    a crucial enabler for adding value to whatever products and services the organization
    produces.

    work and information flow capabilities. You learned that VSM and Agile share this
    principle, but their timelines and scope of effort are different. For example,
    Agile teams use Retrospectives to evaluate relatively small-scale improvements
    they can make over the next Sprint.

    do.
