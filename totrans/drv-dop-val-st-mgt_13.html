			<p>This section introduces you to modern VSM tool capabilities, VSM tool vendors, and the leading VSM methodologists or thought leaders. Starting with <a href="B17087_11_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor291"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a><strong class="bold">, </strong><em class="italic">Identifying VSM Tool Types and Capabilities</em>, you will learn about the capabilities of modern VSM tools. Specifically, you will learn about the three primary categories of VSM tools, as defined by Gartner, including DevOps value stream management platforms (VSMPs), value stream delivery platforms (VSDPs), and continuous compliance automation (CCA) tools. </p>
			<p>Then, in <a href="B17087_12_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor342"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a><strong class="bold">, </strong><em class="italic">Introducing the Leading VSM Tool Vendors</em>, you will learn about the offerings from 15 VSM tool vendors spanning all three categories. Rather than regurgitating information available from other industry analysts, I invited a total of 24 vendors to tell me how they have positioned their products in the VSM tools industry and what they believe are their competitive strengths. The 15 VSM tool vendors identified in this chapter agreed to interviews and to showcase their capabilities. </p>
			<p><a href="B17087_13_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor373"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a><strong class="bold">, </strong><em class="italic">Introducing the VSM-DevOps Practice Leaders</em>, introduces you to the VSM Consortium, The Project Management Institute's Disciplined Agile (DA), and Scaled Agile, Inc.'s Scaled Agile Framework® as the biggest thought leaders and providers of VSM methodologies applied to modern IT practices to improve CI/CD and DevOps pipeline flows. They are also the leaders in modern thought on the application of Lean-Agile practices to digital business transformation. Similar to the approach taken with the VSM tool vendors, each of these organizations worked with me directly to showcase their methodologies and activities related to value stream management. </p>
			<p>Finally, <a href="B17087_14_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor411"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a><strong class="bold">, </strong><em class="italic">Introducing the Enterprise Lean-VSM Practice Leaders</em>, introduces the original thought leaders behind value streams – the Lean Enterprise Institute (LEI) and LeanFITT™. Along with the Lean Enterprise Academy, these two organizations have been some of the leading researchers and thought leaders behind modern Lean and VSM practices. </p>
			<p>For example, in 1994, in a Harvard Business Review (HBR) article titled<strong class="bold"> </strong><em class="italic">From Lean Production to the Lean Enterprise</em>, the founder of the LEI, James Womack, along with his collaborator Daniel T. Jones (founder and chairman of the <em class="italic">Lean Enterprise Academy</em>),<strong class="bold"> </strong>coined the term <em class="italic">value streams</em>. In addition, Don Tapping, Todd Sperl, and their collaborators at LeanFITT have co-written more than 50 books on Lean practices, including some of the original works on the concepts behind VSM as a general methodology for implementing Lean production improvements.</p>
