- en: This section introduces you to modern VSM tool capabilities, VSM tool vendors,
    and the leading VSM methodologists or thought leaders. Starting with [*Chapter
    11*](B17087_11_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor291)**,** *Identifying VSM Tool
    Types and Capabilities*, you will learn about the capabilities of modern VSM tools.
    Specifically, you will learn about the three primary categories of VSM tools,
    as defined by Gartner, including DevOps value stream management platforms (VSMPs),
    value stream delivery platforms (VSDPs), and continuous compliance automation
    (CCA) tools.

    *Introducing the Leading VSM Tool Vendors*, you will learn about the offerings
    from 15 VSM tool vendors spanning all three categories. Rather than regurgitating
    information available from other industry analysts, I invited a total of 24 vendors
    to tell me how they have positioned their products in the VSM tools industry and
    what they believe are their competitive strengths. The 15 VSM tool vendors identified
    in this chapter agreed to interviews and to showcase their capabilities.

    the VSM-DevOps Practice Leaders*, introduces you to the VSM Consortium, The Project
    Management Institute''s Disciplined Agile (DA), and Scaled Agile, Inc.''s Scaled
    Agile Framework® as the biggest thought leaders and providers of VSM methodologies
    applied to modern IT practices to improve CI/CD and DevOps pipeline flows. They
    are also the leaders in modern thought on the application of Lean-Agile practices
    to digital business transformation. Similar to the approach taken with the VSM
    tool vendors, each of these organizations worked with me directly to showcase
    their methodologies and activities related to value stream management.'

    *Introducing the Enterprise Lean-VSM Practice Leaders*, introduces the original
    thought leaders behind value streams – the Lean Enterprise Institute (LEI) and
    LeanFITT™. Along with the Lean Enterprise Academy, these two organizations have
    been some of the leading researchers and thought leaders behind modern Lean and
    VSM practices.

    Lean Production to the Lean Enterprise*, the founder of the LEI, James Womack,
    along with his collaborator Daniel T. Jones (founder and chairman of the *Lean
    Enterprise Academy*),coined the term *value streams*. In addition, Don Tapping,
    Todd Sperl, and their collaborators at LeanFITT have co-written more than 50 books
    on Lean practices, including some of the original works on the concepts behind
    VSM as a general methodology for implementing Lean production improvements.
