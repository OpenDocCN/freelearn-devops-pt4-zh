    October 5, 2020), Gartner states that "By 2023, 70% of organizations will use
    value stream management to improve flow in the DevOps pipeline, leading to faster
    delivery of customer value." ([https://www.gartner.com/](https://www.gartner.com/))

    traction in the IT industry. But it would be a mistake to start implementing the
    tools before understanding the larger objectives of VSM, as well as how to implement
    a VSM activity across a value stream. The problem is that the data and metrics
    that VSM tools provide have little practical use unless we first understand Lean
    value stream improvements' goals and principles. That is why you spent the first
    four chapters learning how to apply a generic VSM methodology.

- en: '**DevOps value stream management platforms** (**VSMPs**): provide out-of-the-box
    connectors to integrate disparate DevOps toolchains and facilitate the orchestration
    of IT activities across the planning, releasing, building, and monitoring activities.
    VSMPs help to improve velocity, quality, and customer value by providing visibility
    and analytics across the IT value stream. When you look up **value stream management**

- en: '**Value stream delivery platforms** (**VSDPs**): Provides integrated toolchains
    as out-of-the-box solutions, usually available as cloud-based CI/CD or DevOps
    platforms. VSDPs also include tools to support the visibility, traceability, auditability,
    and observability of activities across the software delivery value stream. These
    capabilities extend well beyond the traditional DevOps platform capabilities.
    In this sense, VSDPs combine the capabilities of the DevOps platforms with VSM
    tool capabilities. And you will find both DevOps platform vendors and VSM tool
    vendors merging into this shared space.'

- en: '**Continuous compliance automation** (**CCA**) **tools**: These help automate
    and expedite compliance and security-related tasks, replacing manual checklists,
    policies, and worksheets. Moreover, these tools provide visibility to potential
    issues early in the SDLC cycle, when corrections are easier to make and less costly.
    CCA tools should not operate in a vacuum, apart from the organization''s CI/CD,
    DevOps, and VSM platforms and tools. It''s better to have them integrated as part
    of the automated test capabilities with integrated VSM tools, as this helps support
    real-time monitoring, visibility of compliance, and security test results.'

    resiliency roles**, that can help optimize IT value stream flows. Later in this
    book, we'll discuss the importance of incident management and service restoration.

    servers, networks, security systems, and backup systems in a traditional environment
    before each software deployment. This approach is a tedious, expensive, and labor-intensive
    process, spanning multiple skills. The configurations must be exact and consistent

    the data monitoring and visualization capabilities of the VSM tools to see whether
    something is breaking in our DevOps pipeline, including the production environments.
    For example, it's helpful to know when and if we have applications, data stores,
    networks, servers, or security components that are failing. In traditional IT

    before deployment. The problem with this approach is that the code base is entirely
    built by that time and likely hiding a million and one bugs. That's perhaps a

    increments of code iteratively and testing each new increment of functionality
    along the way. So, even if the software is delayed across several sprints to go

    the traditional model.

    a bug make it into production.

    helps minimize risks by having a small group of users validate the feature or
    function's functionality before making a full-scale deployment to all users.

    With VSMP tools, each data source must be mapped to a central repository. In either

    that queries operate end to end on all the data items that have been managed for
    the value streams, as well as their activities. In short, single-source data stores
