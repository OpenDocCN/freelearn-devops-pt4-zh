    out to leading VSM tool, methodology, and service providers and asked them to
    tell us why their customers choose their products. Those vendors who chose to
    be interviewed for this book are listed in this chapter. In my interviews, I asked
    their designated representatives to explain what they believe their particular
    strengths are and why. They also had the opportunity to present one or two customer
    use cases they believed help showcase the strengths of their VSM tools and services.

    new and have been applied to many industries and innumerable value streams. You
    also now know that VSM emerged from the discipline of Lean production improvements.
    Unlike traditional hierarchical and functional-centric views of making process
    improvements, Lean improvement structures organizational activities as orchestrated
    flows to deliver value optimally to internal and external customers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since VSM is fundamentally a strategy to help organizations marshal their resources
    to make Lean improvements, we spent some time in this book learning about Lean.
    And from that training, you now know that Lean is a system for planning and implementing
    continuous process improvements. The focus is on developing efficient production
    and information flows by eliminating all forms of waste from the customer's perspective.
    As a quick reminder, the common types of waste include **defects**, **inventory**,
    **motion**, **overprocessing**, **overproduction**, **transportation**, and **waiting**.

    of defining and improving **value stream flows** as part of any business process
    redesign effort.

    and process improvement initiatives through the lens of making value-based or
    value-delivery improvements, and with IT as a critical enabler of installing business
    process innovations. Furthermore, their writing explains why organizations cannot
    find real business process improvements by building processes and systems that
    maintain the status quo across hierarchical, bureaucratic, and functional domains.
    Put another way, Martin and Davenport advocated using IT to redesign business
    processes, but doing so from the perspective of adding value.

    a discipline has little to do with software tools, or even with making improvements
    to your organization's CI/CD and DevOps pipeline flows. VSM is much bigger and
    more important than that.

    to deliver value across all organizational value streams.

    amount to much if your IT organization is not synced up to support the organization's
    other value streams. Thus, it's essential to understand that your organization
    can expend much time, money, and effort on purchasing CI/CD, DevOps, and VSM tools
    and still fail to improve your value delivery capabilities.

    Burst activities to enable other critical value stream improvements. Therefore,
    such investments are not inexpensive and become portfolio-level investment decisions
    supporting the organization's core business mission and strategy. However, CI/CD,
    DevOps, and VSM toolchain investments are foundational as they support any other
    VSM initiatives and must be evaluated in that light.

    value stream improvement requirements. With this understanding, let's introduce
