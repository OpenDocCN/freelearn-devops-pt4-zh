- en: From the previous chapters, you now know that the concepts behind VSM are not
    new and have been applied to many industries and innumerable value streams. You
    also now know that VSM emerged from the discipline of Lean production improvements.
    Unlike traditional hierarchical and functional-centric views of making process
    improvements, Lean improvement structures organizational activities as orchestrated
    flows to deliver value optimally to internal and external customers.

  zh: 从前面的章节中，你现在知道VSM背后的概念并不新颖，已经被应用于许多行业和无数的价值流。你也知道VSM起源于精益生产改进的学科。与传统的层级化和以职能为中心的过程改进观念不同，精益改进将组织活动结构化为协调的流程，以最佳方式向内部和外部客户交付价值。
- en: Since VSM is fundamentally a strategy to help organizations marshal their resources
    to make Lean improvements, we spent some time in this book learning about Lean.
    And from that training, you now know that Lean is a system for planning and implementing
    continuous process improvements. The focus is on developing efficient production
    and information flows by eliminating all forms of waste from the customer's perspective.
    As a quick reminder, the common types of waste include **defects**, **inventory**,
    **motion**, **overprocessing**, **overproduction**, **transportation**, and **waiting**.

  zh: 由于VSM本质上是一种帮助组织调动资源进行精益改进的策略，我们在本书中花了一些时间学习精益。从这些培训中，你现在知道精益是一种规划和实施持续过程改进的系统。它的核心在于通过从客户的角度消除各种浪费，来发展高效的生产和信息流。提醒一下，常见的浪费类型包括**缺陷**、**库存**、**动作**、**过度加工**、**过度生产**、**运输**和**等待**。

    of defining and improving **value stream flows** as part of any business process

    and process improvement initiatives through the lens of making value-based or
    value-delivery improvements, and with IT as a critical enabler of installing business
    process innovations. Furthermore, their writing explains why organizations cannot
    find real business process improvements by building processes and systems that
    maintain the status quo across hierarchical, bureaucratic, and functional domains.
    Put another way, Martin and Davenport advocated using IT to redesign business
    processes, but doing so from the perspective of adding value.

  zh: 重要的结论是，Martin 和 Davenport 都通过价值导向或价值交付改进的视角来评估流程重组和流程改进举措，并且 IT 是推动业务流程创新的重要推动力。此外，他们的写作解释了为什么组织不能通过建立保持现状的流程和系统来找到真正的业务流程改进，尤其是在等级制、官僚制度和职能领域中。换句话说，Martin
    和 Davenport 主张利用 IT 重新设计业务流程，但要从增加价值的角度来进行。
- en: Based on what you've learned in this book, it should be apparent that VSM as
    a discipline has little to do with software tools, or even with making improvements
    to your organization's CI/CD and DevOps pipeline flows. VSM is much bigger and
    more important than that.

    CI/CD 和 DevOps 流水线可以提高我们在所有组织价值流中交付价值的能力。
- en: But, of course, none of your CI/CD, DevOps, and VSM toolchain investments will
    amount to much if your IT organization is not synced up to support the organization's
    other value streams. Thus, it's essential to understand that your organization
    can expend much time, money, and effort on purchasing CI/CD, DevOps, and VSM tools
    and still fail to improve your value delivery capabilities.

    CI/CD、DevOps 和 VSM 工具，但仍然可能无法提高价值交付能力。
- en: CI/CD, DevOps, and VSM toolchain investments are examples of potential Kaizen
    Burst activities to enable other critical value stream improvements. Therefore,
    such investments are not inexpensive and become portfolio-level investment decisions
    supporting the organization's core business mission and strategy. However, CI/CD,
    DevOps, and VSM toolchain investments are foundational as they support any other
    VSM initiatives and must be evaluated in that light.

- en: This concern is why so much space is devoted in this book to implementing a

    capabilities supported by deeper integration with planning tools and a common

    build, release, and deployment activities. The provisioning of a standard data
    model with integrated analytic tools enables visualization of bottlenecks and

- en: Flow Distribution is essential in helping businesses (product/line-of-business
    owners), and technologists evaluate cause and effects when adjusting flows. For
    example, optimizing for higher flow velocity for features to capture new market
    opportunities may come at the expense of working on other critical items, such
    as fixing bugs and reducing technical debt. The bugs cause negative reviews with
    customers, impacting future deliveries and sales, while the accumulating technical
    debt makes delivery of future enhancements increasingly difficult and expensive.
    Finding the right balance is crucial for the product's long-term success.
