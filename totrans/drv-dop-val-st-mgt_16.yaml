    We will start with an introduction to the VSM Consortium, a not-for-profit trade
    association funded by members (vendors and enterprises) and open to all to support
    the emergence of the value stream management market through research, learning,
    networking, and open source projects.

    implement VSM strategies and methods via their DA-FLEX offerings. PMI acquired
    **Disciplined Agile** (**DA**) and **FLow for Enterprise Transformation (FLEX**),
    both well-established and recognized leaders in their respective fields, to build
    their Lean-Agile practices, training, and certification programs. DA provides
    PMI's Agile practices in software development. In contrast, but complementary,
    you will learn how FLEX is a framework based on Systems Thinking that provides
    a comprehensive set of portfolio, Agile product management, executive/management,
    and program and team patterns for success based on Lean-Agile principles and practices.

- en: Definitionally, **frameworks** provide a basic structure that underlies a system,
    such as software development and delivery. At a conceptual level, software development
    frameworks provide a structured approach to applying Lean and Agile practices.
    For example, SAFe™ and scaled Scrum-based frameworks provide a set of organizational
    structures, events, and processes to implement their Lean-Agile practices. They
    are both very prescriptive in their approach to implementing Lean and Agile practices
    by implementing small team roles, structures, events, and time-boxed development
    cycles. Scrum and SAFe practitioners apply various processes, techniques, and
    methods within their frameworks. However, the basic structures and events remain

  zh: 从定义上看，**框架**提供了支持一个系统的基本结构，例如软件开发和交付。在概念层面上，软件开发框架提供了一种结构化的方法来应用精益和敏捷实践。例如，SAFe™和基于Scrum的扩展框架提供了一整套组织结构、事件和流程，以实施它们的精益敏捷实践。它们在实施精益和敏捷实践时采取的是非常规定化的方式，通过小团队角色、结构、事件和时间框架的开发周期来实施。Scrum和SAFe的实践者在他们的框架内应用各种流程、技术和方法。然而，基本的结构和事件依然保持不变。
- en: In contrast, DA FLEX takes issue with the idea that one approach to implementing
    Lean-Agile practices works equally well for all organizations. Instead, they promote
    the view that organizations must review alternative strategies and tools to evaluate
    which fits better with their needs and cultures. Hence, PMI promotes DA FLEX as
    a toolkit. The basic idea is that value stream teams choose the right tool for
    the right job. Also, as a toolkit, the PMI implements its DA FLEX toolkit as a
    standalone Lean-Agile approach to improve value streams and extend this to other
    frameworks.

  zh: 相比之下，DA FLEX不同意“单一的精益敏捷实践实施方法适用于所有组织”的观点。相反，DA FLEX提倡组织必须审视不同的策略和工具，评估哪些最适合其需求和文化。因此，PMI将DA
    FLEX作为一个工具包来推广。基本思想是，价值流团队根据实际工作需要选择合适的工具。同时，作为一个工具包，PMI将其DA FLEX工具包作为独立的精益敏捷方法，旨在改善价值流并将这一理念扩展到其他框架。
- en: Philosophically, DA FLEX incorporates the concepts behind value stream-based
    continuous flows, Lean improvements, Theory of Constraints, Organizational Development,
    and human behavior. At issue is the concern that hierarchical organization structures,
    based around business functions, are antithetical to supporting Lean flows around

- en: Co-created in 2012 by Scott Ambler and Mark Lines, DA is a process decision
    toolkit that helps individuals, teams, and enterprises optimize their **Way of
    Working** (**WoW**) in a context-specific approach. Scott Ambler and Mark Lines
    are well known in the software development industry because there is no single
    software development strategy that works well in all customer situations. So instead,
    users of the DA toolkit can choose between six different software development
    life cycle approaches and between hundreds of methods and tools with context-based
    guidance on their potential applications.

    discontinuous improvements. In other words, leadership positions come through

    issue with the amount of pollution and congestion in our urban cities. Ackoff's

    work. However, DA FLEX takes issue with the concepts behind frameworks because
    they don't account for the people who use them. For example, frameworks that seem
    overly restrictive or work against an organization's culture and operating system
    inevitably lead to friction and resistance.

    that overly prescriptive frameworks do not address the complex interrelationships
    between the people operating within them from a system-thinking perspective. In
    other words, regardless of the Lean or Agile approach employed, we need to address
    the interactions between people, processes, and events systemically. Thus, the
    DA FLEX approach implements their toolkit as organized process blades, each of
    which includes related sets of methods and tools that organizations employ situationally
    to fit their needs in the value delivery systems they operate.

    On the contrary, DA FLEX acknowledges that too much management, over-planning,
    over-design, and overly large projects are ineffective, dooming software projects

    In such cases, multiple teams integrate their work into the whole product or service
    frequently. For example, the teams' work might involve integrating work items
    within a single value stream or orchestrating work items across multiple, but
    interconnected, value streams.

    criteria. Those released services will have a limited impact if something is wrong,

    delivery pipelines across all SAFe configurations. Now let's move on to understand
    how SAFe DevOps improves continuous delivery pipelines.

    DevOps as a critical enabler of success, as well as extending its application
    of DevOps to the entire value stream. Of course, you now know that DevOps is the
    critical enabler to compete in our digital economy; and that is the position that
    Scaled Agile adopts, too. In this context, SAFe DevOps follows the VSM tool initiatives
    we discussed in [*Chapter 11*](B17087_11_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor291),
    *Identifying VSM Tool Types and Capabilities*.

    supports improvements to continuous deliveries. This topic will also take us back
    to the discussion of value stream management as it's applied within SAFe. As you
    will find, SAFe DevOps encompasses a number of concepts that we will only briefly
    cover.

    as a whole. In this section, you learned how SAFe supports implementing value
    streams through their agile and solutions-oriented release trains. SAFe provides
    direct guidance on leveraging the resources of a large enterprise, taking advantage
    of their economies of scale while supporting their digital transformations through
    Lean-Agile improvements. Like Disciplined Agile, SAFe includes DevOps as a critical
    enabler to improve software value deliveries in support of the organization's
    digital improvement objectives.

    of the VSM concept in a modern Lean environment, specifically leveraging improvements
    to DevOps pipeline flows to streamline an organization's software value delivery
    capabilities. First, you learned about the VSMC, a not-for-profit trade association
    funded by members (vendors and enterprises) to conduct research, learning, networking,
    and open source projects related to value stream management methods and tools
    applied to software delivery improvements.

    deliveries using value stream management techniques.

    – the current leading framework for scaling agile practices on an enterprise scale.
    You've learned that SAFe DevOps is Scaled Agile's approach to implementing VSM
    concepts as part of DevOps to maximize business value flow through the end-to-end
    solution delivery life cycle. You've also learned how SAFe DevOps implements VSM,
    Lean, Agile, and DevOps values, principles, and practices across functions in
    the continuous operation, measurement, and optimization of value streams from
    customer requests to solution delivery.

    learn about two of the leading Lean methodology and training organizations, **Lean
    Enterprise Institute** and **LeanFITT**. These two organizations defined the original
    concepts behind value streams and value stream management, respectively.
