    implement VSM strategies and methods via their DA-FLEX offerings. PMI acquired
    **Disciplined Agile** (**DA**) and **FLow for Enterprise Transformation (FLEX**),
    both well-established and recognized leaders in their respective fields, to build
    their Lean-Agile practices, training, and certification programs. DA provides
    PMI's Agile practices in software development. In contrast, but complementary,
    you will learn how FLEX is a framework based on Systems Thinking that provides
    a comprehensive set of portfolio, Agile product management, executive/management,
    and program and team patterns for success based on Lean-Agile principles and practices.

    DA FLEX as a toolkit that includes practices that work together. The distinction
    between frameworks and toolkits is subtle, so let's take a few minutes to understand
    the differences.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Definitionally, **frameworks** provide a basic structure that underlies a system,
    such as software development and delivery. At a conceptual level, software development
    frameworks provide a structured approach to applying Lean and Agile practices.
    For example, SAFe™ and scaled Scrum-based frameworks provide a set of organizational
    structures, events, and processes to implement their Lean-Agile practices. They
    are both very prescriptive in their approach to implementing Lean and Agile practices
    by implementing small team roles, structures, events, and time-boxed development
    cycles. Scrum and SAFe practitioners apply various processes, techniques, and
    methods within their frameworks. However, the basic structures and events remain
    intact.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast, DA FLEX takes issue with the idea that one approach to implementing
    Lean-Agile practices works equally well for all organizations. Instead, they promote
    the view that organizations must review alternative strategies and tools to evaluate
    which fits better with their needs and cultures. Hence, PMI promotes DA FLEX as
    a toolkit. The basic idea is that value stream teams choose the right tool for
    the right job. Also, as a toolkit, the PMI implements its DA FLEX toolkit as a
    standalone Lean-Agile approach to improve value streams and extend this to other
    frameworks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Philosophically, DA FLEX incorporates the concepts behind value stream-based
    continuous flows, Lean improvements, Theory of Constraints, Organizational Development,

    value delivery.

    stream always begins and ends with the customer. They also make the distinction
    between the work within a value stream and the people doing the work. Their concern
    is that conflating the two works against the organization as value streams have
    a singular focus while people may support work in multiple value streams.

    people utilized to the throughput of value. While functional organizational structures

    product flows in the traditional model. Instead, it is management by committees,

    that problem – an organizational structural alignment problem. And then, we need
    to make sure that we have defined efficient and streamlined flows with minimal

    *Analyzing Complex Systems Interactions*. Recall from the previous chapter that
    system thinking evaluates complexity through the lens of interactions across all

    discussion occurred well before the issue of climate change became a foreground

    quality must address both efficiency and effectiveness in delivering value. That
    is to say, we need to apply wisdom along with our knowledge.

    they don't account for the people who use them. For example, frameworks that seem

    which is highly influenced by their traditional hierarchical and functional organizational
    structures. As a result, business processes tend to support the localized goals

    may be optimized for the needs of the department, they probably aren't in terms

    most significant impact on downstream activities. This means that problems at

    the problem.

    stream, it's much more disruptive to the organization to add new value streams
    due to the number of potential cross-value stream impacts. In addition, the interconnected
    value streams create an even larger and more complex system of interrelated activities.
    Therefore, we want to start thinking about end-to-end flows at the start of our

    the core teams tend to contain specialists needed to augment the feature teams.

    from different companies – even in different industries – are surprisingly similar.
    This is similar to the view espoused by James Martin in his book *The Great Transition*
    (Martin, 1995). But, on the other hand, the differences are what deliver value
    and competitive advantage. So, determine what's needed for your organization and
    recognize that there are no universal solutions.

    as a whole. In this section, you learned how SAFe supports implementing value
    streams through their agile and solutions-oriented release trains. SAFe provides
    direct guidance on leveraging the resources of a large enterprise, taking advantage
    of their economies of scale while supporting their digital transformations through
    Lean-Agile improvements. Like Disciplined Agile, SAFe includes DevOps as a critical
    enabler to improve software value deliveries in support of the organization's
    digital improvement objectives.

    of the VSM concept in a modern Lean environment, specifically leveraging improvements
    to DevOps pipeline flows to streamline an organization's software value delivery
    capabilities. First, you learned about the VSMC, a not-for-profit trade association
    funded by members (vendors and enterprises) to conduct research, learning, networking,
    and open source projects related to value stream management methods and tools
    applied to software delivery improvements.

    organizations install Lean-Agile practices on an enterprise scale. In this section,
    you've learned that the DA toolkit helps you, your teams and your organizations
    choose their WOW best supporting their unique circumstances. You've also learned
    how FLEX is PMI's approach to implementing value stream flows and improve value
    deliveries using value stream management techniques.

- en: The third Lean-Agile/VSM implementation approach you learned about is SAFe™
    – the current leading framework for scaling agile practices on an enterprise scale.
    You've learned that SAFe DevOps is Scaled Agile's approach to implementing VSM
    concepts as part of DevOps to maximize business value flow through the end-to-end
    solution delivery life cycle. You've also learned how SAFe DevOps implements VSM,
    Lean, Agile, and DevOps values, principles, and practices across functions in
    the continuous operation, measurement, and optimization of value streams from
    customer requests to solution delivery.

    improvements, we will move on to [*Chapter 14*](B17087_14_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor411),
    *Introducing the Enterprise Lean-VSM Practice Leaders*. In that chapter, you will
    learn about two of the leading Lean methodology and training organizations, **Lean
    Enterprise Institute** and **LeanFITT**. These two organizations defined the original
    concepts behind value streams and value stream management, respectively.
