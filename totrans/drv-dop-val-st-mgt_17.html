			<p>This chapter provides instructions on the leading Lean-oriented practice and methodology leaders, including the <strong class="bold">Lean Enterprise Institute</strong> (<strong class="bold">LEI</strong>) and <strong class="bold">LeanFITT™</strong>. These two organizations are included because Lean practices evolved separately from Agile, and these are two of the longest operating thought leaders behind the Lean movement.  </p>
			<p>LEI was founded in 1997 by management expert <a id="_idTextAnchor412"/>James P. Womack, Ph.D. and his colleague, Daniel T. Jones. Womack and Jones coined the term <em class="italic">value stream</em> in an article published in the <em class="italic">Harvard Business Review</em> magazine, <em class="italic">From Lean Production to the Lean Enterprise</em> (Womack and Jones, March-April 1994; <a href="https://hbr.org/1994/03/from-lean-production-to-the-lean-enterprise">https://hbr.org/1994/03/from-lean-production-to-the-lean-enterprise</a>). LEI promotes on its website that the organization "<em class="italic">conducts research, teaches educational workshops, publishes books and eBooks, runs conferences, and shares practical information about lean thinking and practices</em>."</p>
			<p>The second organization, LeanFITT™, developed the <strong class="bold">value stream management</strong> (<strong class="bold">VSM</strong>) methodology used in this book (<a href="B17087_06_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a><em class="italic">, Launching the VSM Initiative (VSM Steps 1 - 3)</em>  through<em class="italic"> </em><a href="B17087_10_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor272"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a><em class="italic">, Improving the Lean-Agile Value Delivery Cycle (VSM Steps 7 and 8)</em>), as a reference model to make Lean-oriented improvements across a <strong class="bold">continuous integration/continuous</strong> <strong class="bold">delivery</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>) pipeline flow. LeanFITT has a broader focus on VSM, improving all organizational value streams, not just those in <strong class="bold">Information Technology</strong> (<strong class="bold">IT</strong>). The LeanFITT™ team has collaborated, since 2001, in authoring more than 50 books and learning tools and materials on VSM as a practical approach to making Lean improvements enterprise-wide and across any type of value stream. LeanFITT's founders were the original thought leaders in the early development of VSM concepts and methodologies.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to introduce the relevance of these two companies to VSM in the following sections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a id="_idTextAnchor413"/>Going all-in on Lean</li>
				<li>Introducing LEI</li>
				<li>Getting started with Lean</li>
				<li>Implementing a phase-based approach to Lean improvements</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-335"><a id="_idTextAnchor414"/>Going all-in on Lean</h1>
			<p>By now, you should fully understand the premise behind this book: </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Understanding the bigger VSM picture</p>
			<p class="callout"><em class="italic">Our modern VSM tools-oriented industry will have a very short life if organizations do not fundamentally understand that VSM is not limited to making flow improvements to CI/CD and DevOps pipeline flows. Those are critical objectives. However, the much larger opportunity is to deploy our improved IT pipeline flows and resources to improve the products and value streams across the organization. Otherwise, companies will spend much money, time, and effort installing integrated, automated, and orchestrated toolchains only to find they have little impact on the organization's bottom line and its value delivery capabilities.</em></p>
			<p>At issue is the fact that improving one of the organization's value streams, from a systems-thinking <a id="_idIndexMarker1809"/>perspective, is a form of local optimization if we don't look at its contribution to the system as a whole. Thus, we need to use our improved IT value stream delivery capabilities to drive improvements across the organization's other value streams. We do that by using the same VSM methods taught in this book but applied across all organizational value streams. </p>
			<p>In the process, we will find that many potential value stream improvements have an information, integration, automation, and orchestration component that IT can address. So, the justifications <a id="_idIndexMarker1810"/>to our investments in improving IT CI/CD and <strong class="bold">development-operations</strong> (<strong class="bold">DevOps</strong>) pipelines are not derived from the accelerated delivery of software, at least not in a vacuum. Instead, the larger justifications come from using software to accelerate Lean-oriented improvements across all organizational value streams. </p>
			<p>In <a href="B17087_07_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor183"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Mapping the Current State  (VSM Step 4)</em>, the VSM team selected improvements to a CI/CD pipeline as its high-priority Lean improvement initiative. The purpose of that selection was to highlight that IT can be the exclusive subject of a VSM improvement initiative. However, the VSM team could have easily selected another organizational value stream, where improvements to the CI/CD pipeline were one of the identified Kaizen Bursts (improvements) necessary to improve work and information flows within the targeted value stream. </p>
			<p>Therefore, we need to employ a generic VSM methodology and let the organization's strategic goals, portfolio investment priorities, and current state-future state analysis lead to identify and select our Lean improvement objectives. Since Lean production improvements are the operative concepts behind VSM, we shouldn't have different VSM approaches for different value streams. </p>
			<p>So, it should be apparent that the importance of LEI and LeanFITT organizations is not related to leveraging the power of modern VSM tools. Instead, they have laid the groundwork on using VSM as an approach to improve all organizational value streams, including those in IT, to efficiently deliver value in support of the mission and priorities of the business. </p>
			<p>With this foundation laid, let's move on to learn about LEI and LeanFITT. First, we'll start with an introduction to LEI.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-336"><a id="_idTextAnchor415"/>Introducing LEI</h1>
			<p>In this section, you will learn about LEI, perhaps the best-known Lean training organization <a id="_idIndexMarker1811"/>due to its founder's deep studies into the principles of Lean practices developed initially at Toyota and then widely adopted across the world.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-337"><a id="_idTextAnchor416"/>Training and certification programs</h2>
			<p>LEI is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit based in Boston, <strong class="bold">Massachusetts</strong> (<strong class="bold">MA</strong>). Its stated mission is to make <a id="_idIndexMarker1812"/>things better through Lean thinking and practice. </p>
			<p>LEI was founded in 1997 by management expert James P. Womack, Ph.D., who wrote the seminal book on Lean, <em class="italic">The Machine that Changed the World.</em> Today, LEI promotes its efforts to conduct research, teach educational workshops, publish books and e-books, run conferences, and share practical information about lean thinking and practice.</p>
			<p>Compared with traditional "<em class="italic">think</em>" tanks, LEI views its organization as a <em class="italic">do</em> tank. As you will find in later sections, LEI applies the same Lean principle to guide its research activities. Specifically, it develops hypotheses about lean thinking and experiment to see which approaches work best in the real world. It then writes up and teaches what it has discovered to offer new methods for organizational transformation.</p>
			<p>LEI strives to answer the simple question every manager should ask: <em class="italic">What can I do on Monday morning to make a difference in my organization?</em> By creating a robust lean community through its website and public events, the goal of LEI is to give managers the courage to become lean change agents.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">LEI's mission statement</p>
			<p class="callout">"<em class="italic">Make things better, through lean thinking and practice.</em>"</p>
			<p>LEI carries <a id="_idIndexMarker1813"/>out its mission through the following value streams: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Lean education </li>
				<li>Lean learning materials </li>
				<li>Co-learning partnerships </li>
				<li>Lean Summit conferences </li>
				<li>LEI's website: <a href="https://www.lean.org/">https://www.lean.org/</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition, LEI's <a id="_idIndexMarker1814"/>practitioners exchange <a id="_idIndexMarker1815"/>information across the world through the Lean Global Network (<a href="http://leanglobal.org/">http://leanglobal.org/</a>), consisting of more than a dozen nonprofit organizations similar to LEI, all sharing a joint mission in different countries.</p>
			<p>LEI is a professional resource to companies, executives, managers, team leaders, and team members.  Anyone wishing to join the transformation to a lean way of creating value is <a id="_idIndexMarker1816"/>welcome to join LEI's Lean community (<a href="https://www.lean.org/WhoWeAre/why_join.cfm">https://www.lean.org/WhoWeAre/why_join.cfm</a>). The LEI organization exists to support everyone who is starting or continuing the lean journey.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-338"><a id="_idTextAnchor417"/>Articulating VSM concepts</h2>
			<p>LEI does not explicitly define VSM. However, readers can find several articles linked to the topic on LEI's website. </p>
			<p>For example, James Womack wrote an article in 2002 titled <em class="italic">Substituting Money for Value Stream Management</em>. The premise behind that article is that he often found company line managers and executives are "<em class="italic">given a set of key metrics -- each with a stretch goal for this year -- and motivated by a bonus to reach the goals</em>." </p>
			<p>The issue <a id="_idIndexMarker1817"/>is that those managers and executives have multiple value streams running through their functional departments, but the metrics and financial incentives drive department or facility-level improvements. As Womack states: "<em class="italic">natural conflicts have emerged between what's best for the department or facility and what's best for the product as its value stream flows from start to finish through many departments and facilities.</em>"</p>
			<p>Womack notes that other problems arise that create <strong class="bold">exhaustion</strong> among those responsible for resolving them. He boils the issues down to the following three root causes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lack of a policy deployment process</strong> to prioritize improvement initiatives and to down-select to a shortlist that can reasonably be accomplished and stabilized each year.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">No assigned value stream managers</strong> with the responsibility to look at the entire value stream for each product family, to optimize the whole rather than the parts.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Multiple and conflicting metrics</strong>, without prioritization or training, can lead to exhaustion and a constant sense of failure.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In 2009, Dan Jones, then the Chairman of the Lean Enterprise Academy, wrote an article titled <em class="italic">Value Stream Management</em>. In this article, which coincided with the ending of the so-called "Great Recession", Jones discusses the "<em class="italic">growing impact of the web in opening up the possibility of turning customers from strangers to partners</em>." The premise of his article is that the web establishes a closer connection to our customers, turning them into demanding partners. Specifically, these customers demand that we "<em class="italic">deliver exactly what they want, when, where and how they want it and to significantly improve the experience of using these products and services while minimizing the impact on the environment</em>".</p>
			<p>Still, when he wrote the article, many companies had 200- to 300-day supply chains, and retailers could respond to their customers' demands. Jones found that suppliers highlighted 98% service delivery levels, but in reality, they were only accepting ~70% of their retailers' orders. The only way to close this gap is to apply VSM concepts to decrease supply chain lead times from months to days. </p>
			<p>However, Jones notes the greatest obstacle to the successful application to VSM is because "<em class="italic">functions, departments and business units have become too powerful and act in their own interests.</em>" In other words, organizations ignore the voice of the customer to support functional, bureaucratic, and self-serving interests. </p>
			<p>Jones' observations are not much different from those made by Womack in his article 7 years earlier. Putting the control of value delivery into the hands of hierarchical and functional <a id="_idIndexMarker1818"/>departments takes the focus away from the flow of value from the perspective of the organization's customers. Jones notes that the best way forward requires rebalancing the power of functional organizations by introducing value stream analysis and VSM. We also need to apply scientific methods of experimentation to resolve problems and find better ways to design the management systems necessary to create and sustain new systemic solutions to our development, operations, and supply chain delivery problems.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-339"><a id="_idTextAnchor418"/>Implementing the core concepts behind Lean </h2>
			<p>The central idea behind Lean is to maximize customer value while minimizing waste. More simply put, lean means creating more value for customers with fewer resources.</p>
			<p>A lean <a id="_idIndexMarker1819"/>organization understands customer value and focuses its key processes on increasing it continuously. The ultimate goal is to provide perfect value to the customer through a perfect value creation process with zero waste.</p>
			<p>Lean thinking changes the focus of management from optimizing separate technologies, assets, and vertical departments to optimizing the flow of products and services through entire value streams that flow horizontally across technologies, assets, and departments to customers. Eliminating waste along entire value streams creates processes that need less human effort, less space, less capital, and less time to make products and services at far lower cost and with much fewer defects than traditional business systems. Companies can also respond to changing customer desires with high variety, high quality, low cost, and decreased throughput times. Also, information management becomes <a id="_idIndexMarker1820"/>much simpler and more accurate. </p>
			<p>More details on this subject are available on LEI's website at <a href="https://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/">https://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-340"><a id="_idTextAnchor419"/>Getting started with Lean</h1>
			<p>LEI does not promote Lean as a <strong class="bold">grand theory</strong> where one size fits all. Instead, LEI views Lean as an <a id="_idIndexMarker1821"/>approach to develop a set of standard practices for your organization based on experiments. The Lean process starts by defining a value-creating process in the form of a <strong class="bold">value stream</strong> or <strong class="bold">model lines</strong>. Next, organizations identify their value streams and use value stream mapping techniques to describe current and future state flows. </p>
			<p>LEI's definition of value streams is contained in the call-out box that follows.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Value streams</p>
			<p class="callout">All of the actions, both value-creating and non-value-creating, are required to bring a product from <a id="_idIndexMarker1822"/>concept to launch (also known as a <strong class="bold">development value stream</strong>) and from order to delivery (also known as an <strong class="bold">operational value stream</strong>). These include actions to process information from the customer <a id="_idIndexMarker1823"/>and actions to transform the product on its way to the customer.</p>
			<p>Invariably, the lean transformation efforts will identify problems, issues, and areas of waste that prevent efficient flows of information and products. Lean transformation teams address each issue as a unique problem-solving activity. </p>
			<p>LEI proposes <a id="_idIndexMarker1824"/>using the <strong class="bold">A3 technique</strong> as the best way to form a hypothesis about how to make things better. Specifically, A3 is a technique to solve both large and small problems that inevitably show up every day. </p>
			<p>As with the process behind <strong class="bold">risk analysis and improvements</strong>, A3 looks beyond the symptoms that we can easily see to discover and address the root causes. Only by addressing the root causes can we hope to resolve problems and keep them at bay.</p>
			<p>A3 was developed as part of the <strong class="bold">Toyota Production System</strong> (<strong class="bold">TPS</strong>). The A3 content is always <a id="_idIndexMarker1825"/>published as a one-page report. In fact, the acronym A3 comes from the European standard A3 paper size (11 inches by 17 inches or 29.7 cm x 42 cm).</p>
			<p>A3 incorporates three roles, as shown here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Problem owner</strong>: They are responsible for managing the A3 process and creating and maintaining documents.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Responders/stakeholders</strong>: These are the people up and down the value stream, plus executive managers who are most interested and impacted by the outcomes of the A3 project.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Mentor/coach</strong>: This is an expert Lean practitioner who gives guidance and prompts the problem owner to find the solution, but not to give answers or offer solutions.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The A3 reports <a id="_idIndexMarker1826"/>contain information related to the problem-solving effort, as shown in<em class="italic"> </em>the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer153" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_14.1.jpg" alt="Figure 14.1 – Typical A3 report content and format&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.1 – Typical A3 report content and format</p>
			<p>Now that you've seen a brief example of the A3 format, let's get more into the details of how the report is used.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-341"><a id="_idTextAnchor420"/>Improving through experimentation</h2>
			<p>You should be aware that there are many variations of the A3 report in content and format. None of these are wrong, so long as they help your team get to the root cause of your problem. </p>
			<p>The basic strategy is to identify where you are, then identify the business problem or opportunity and its root cause. Use metrics to measure performance gaps and determine the potential countermeasures. The problem-solving team uses the traditional <strong class="bold">plan-do-check-act</strong> or <strong class="bold">plan-do-check-adjust</strong> (<strong class="bold">PDCA</strong>) cycle to experiment <a id="_idIndexMarker1827"/>against the available options to identify and select the best approach. </p>
			<p>Through <a id="_idIndexMarker1828"/>countless engagements, LEI has learned that Lean transformation efforts must be led by line managers, and not by a community of practice <a id="_idIndexMarker1829"/>or a CI team. Line managers include the <strong class="bold">Chief Executive Officer</strong> (<strong class="bold">CEO</strong>), <strong class="bold">Chief Operations Officer</strong> (<strong class="bold">COO</strong>), <strong class="bold">Chief Financial Officer</strong> (<strong class="bold">CFO</strong>), Executive/<strong class="bold">Business Unit</strong> (<strong class="bold">BU</strong>) Head, Department Head, Facility <a id="_idIndexMarker1830"/>Manager, Area Leader, or Line Manager. So, in other <a id="_idIndexMarker1831"/>words, problem-solving efforts occur at all levels <a id="_idIndexMarker1832"/>of the organization but are always led by the most in-line executive or manager.</p>
			<p>In contrast, the <strong class="bold">Communities of Practice</strong> (<strong class="bold">CoPs</strong>), CI teams, or VSM teams serve in the role <a id="_idIndexMarker1833"/>of mentors and coaches. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-342"><a id="_idTextAnchor421"/>Reflecting, sharing, and improving</h2>
			<p>LEI's approach <a id="_idIndexMarker1834"/>to lean improvements is not a one-off problem-solving <a id="_idIndexMarker1835"/>activity. Instead, with each problem-solving effort, the team reflects on what <a id="_idIndexMarker1836"/>they've learned. But if the learnings stay within the assessment team, the organization as a whole cannot evolve. </p>
			<p>Therefore, lean transformations depend upon sharing lessons learned vertically and horizontally across the organization and its value streams. The Japanese term for this is <strong class="bold">Yokoten</strong>, which is essentially the spreading of good ideas. Finally, we need to keep on experimenting to <a id="_idIndexMarker1837"/>find new ways to improve. That is the essence behind achieving CI—identifying and resolving problems as a never-ending work cycle. </p>
			<p>Let's take <a id="_idIndexMarker1838"/>a moment to summarize what we've learned so far. </p>
			<p>In summary, LEI's <a id="_idIndexMarker1839"/>approach to Lean transformations involves the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Identifying <a id="_idIndexMarker1840"/>and mapping your value streams</li>
				<li>Solving problems via the A3 problem-solving model</li>
				<li>Using experimentation to improve continuously</li>
				<li>Reflecting on what was learned</li>
				<li>Sharing our findings with others throughout t<a id="_idTextAnchor422"/>he organization</li>
				<li>Maintaining CI</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we understand LEI's approach to Lean transformation, let's take a quick look at LEI's principles guiding its Lean practices.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-343"><a id="_idTextAnchor423"/>Defining the principles of Lean</h2>
			<p>LEI defined <a id="_idIndexMarker1841"/>five principles behind its Lean practices, as noted on the Lean.org website: <a href="https://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/Principles.cfm">https://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/Principles.cfm</a>. The principles define a flow for guiding Lean implementations.</p>
			<p>"The five-step thought process for guiding the implementation of lean techniques is easy to remember, but not always easy to achieve:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Specify value from the standpoint of the end customer by product family.</li>
				<li>Identify all the steps in the value stream for each product family, eliminating whenever possible those steps that do not create value.</li>
				<li>Make the value-creating steps occur in tight sequence so the product will flow smoothly toward the customer.</li>
				<li>As flow is introduced, let customers pull value from the next upstream activity.</li>
				<li>As value is specified, value streams are identified, wasted steps are removed, and flow and pull are introduced, begin the process again and continue it until a state of perfection is reached in which perfect value is created with no waste."</li>
			</ol>
			<p>LEI portrays its five Lean principles as a cyclical process, shown in the following screenshot: </p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.2 – LEI's principles of Lean </p>
			<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker1842"/>we understand LEI's Lean principles, let's take a quick look at the breadth of potential applications in which Lean applies.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-344"><a id="_idTextAnchor424"/>Applying Lean across the organization</h2>
			<p>LEI makes it clear that Lean is not simply used to improve manufacturing production processes. Lean-oriented <a id="_idIndexMarker1843"/>approaches improve every business and every process within the business. Lean also operates as a strategic initiative and not as a singular-use or tactical program. Nor is Lean a cost-reduction program; instead, Lean is a way of thinking and acting to improve value delivery across the entire enterprise. </p>
			<p>LEI provides more information on this topic at the following web page: <a href="https://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/">https://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/</a></p>
			<p>LEI notes that <strong class="bold">transformation</strong> or <strong class="bold">lean transformation</strong> is often used to characterize a company <a id="_idIndexMarker1844"/>moving from an old way of thinking to lean thinking. Lean requires <a id="_idIndexMarker1845"/>a complete transformation of how a company conducts its business. </p>
			<p>Lean does <a id="_idIndexMarker1846"/>not happen overnight. Instead, organizations must take a long-term perspective and persevere. So, let's take a moment to understand the business issues that justify a Lean transformation. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-345"><a id="_idTextAnchor425"/>Implementing Lean to drive business transformations</h2>
			<p>LEI founders <a id="_idIndexMarker1847"/>Womack and Jones outlined three fundamental business issues that should guide the transformation of the entire organization (<a href="https://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/">https://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/</a>). These are listed here: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Purpose</strong>: Which <a id="_idIndexMarker1848"/>customer problems will the enterprise solve to achieve its own purpose of prospering?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Process</strong>: How will <a id="_idIndexMarker1849"/>the organization assess each major value stream to make sure each step is valuable, capable, available, adequate, and flexible, and that all the steps are linked by flow, pull, and leveling?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">People</strong>: How can <a id="_idIndexMarker1850"/>the organization ensure that every important process has someone responsible for continually evaluating that value stream in terms of business purpose and lean process? How can everyone touching the value stream be actively engaged in operating it correctly and continually improving it?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we know what drives an organization to adopt Lean practices, let's look at methods to develop Lean action plans.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-346"><a id="_idTextAnchor426"/>Creating a Lean action plan</h2>
			<p>While every individual or company embarking on a lean journey will have different challenges <a id="_idIndexMarker1851"/>based on their particular set of circumstances, several crucial steps can help reduce resistance, spread the right learning objectives, and engender the type of commitment necessary for a lean enterprise. LEI provides more details on this topic at the following web page: <a href="https://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/GettingStarted.cfm">https://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/GettingStarted.cfm</a>.</p>
			<h3>Getting started</h3>
			<p>LEI promotes the following action-oriented steps to start the organization and adopt Lean as the new operating model:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Find a change agent</strong>, a leader who will take personal responsibility for the lean transformation.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Get lean knowledge</strong> via a sensei or consultant who can teach lean techniques and implement them as part of a system, not as isolated programs.</li>
				<li>Find a lever by <strong class="bold">seizing a crisis</strong> or by creating one to begin the transformation. If your <a id="_idIndexMarker1852"/>company isn't in crisis, focus attention on a lean competitor or find a lean customer or supplier who will make demands for dramatically better performance.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Forget grand strategy</strong> for the moment.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Map the value streams</strong>, beginning with the current state of how material and information flow, then draw a leaner future state of how they should flow, and create an implementation plan with a timetable.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Begin as soon as possible</strong> with an essential and visible activity.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Demand immediate results</strong> and don’t let things get bogged down through a lack of leadership, support, or sufficient priorities.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Expand your scope</strong> to link improvements in the value streams and move beyond the shop floor to office processes as soon as you've got momentum.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we know how to get started, we also need to understand the organizational structures supporting Lean transformations.</p>
			<h3>Creating an organization to channel your value streams</h3>
			<p>Lean <a id="_idIndexMarker1853"/>production processes will change the way your organization operates. While organizations may choose to maintain hierarchical and functional departments to build and maintain skills, value delivery leadership must move to support cross-functional value stream deliveries, if it existed at all. In other words, value flows horizontally even when your management structure operates vertically.</p>
			<p>LEI <a id="_idIndexMarker1854"/>provides the following guidance to organizations implementing Lean transformation strategies:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Reorganize your firm by product family and value stream.</li>
				<li>Create a lean promotion function.</li>
				<li>Deal with excess people at the outset, and then promise that no one will lose their job in the future due to the introduction of lean techniques.</li>
				<li>Devise a growth strategy.</li>
				<li>Remove the anchor-draggers.</li>
				<li>Once you've fixed something, fix it again.</li>
				<li>Two steps forward and one step backward is OK; no steps forward is not OK</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Organizations adopting Lean as a new operating model must also install business systems to encourage and support lean practices, which is discussed in the following subsection. </p>
			<h3>Installing business systems to encourage Lean thinking</h3>
			<p>Creating an action plan and realigning resources are critical endeavors to support a Lean transformation. However, the practices won't stick unless the organization's executives install the <a id="_idIndexMarker1855"/>necessary business systems to support and encourage lean-oriented transformations. With this objective in mind, LEI recommends the installation of the following business systems:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Utilize policy deployment.</li>
				<li>Create a lean accounting system.</li>
				<li>Pay your people in relation to the performance of your firm.</li>
				<li>Make performance measures transparent.</li>
				<li>Teach lean thinking and skills to everyone.</li>
				<li>Right-size your tools, such as production equipment and information systems.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>At this point, we have action plans in place, an organizational structure that supports the goals <a id="_idIndexMarker1856"/>of the Lean transformation, and business systems to encourage long-term adoption of Lean thinking. We now need to take steps to complete the Lean transformation.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-347"><a id="_idTextAnchor427"/>Completing the transformation</h2>
			<p>The final activities within the organization's Lean action plan help resolve the issues identified by Womack and Jones in their articles on VSM. These actions focus on aligning your supply <a id="_idIndexMarker1857"/>chain partners to value delivery and doing so on a global basis. We also need to make sure the leadership and decision-making processes align to support our Lean adoptions. </p>
			<p>LEI recommends the following activities to complete or round out your Lean transformation <a id="_idIndexMarker1858"/>action plans:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Convince your suppliers and customers to take the steps just described.</li>
				<li>Develop a lean global strategy.</li>
				<li>Convert from top-down leadership to leadership based on questioning, coaching, and teaching and rooted in the scientific method of PDCA.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>LEI provides a framework to support Lean transformations, which is the topic of the next section. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-348"><a id="_idTextAnchor428"/>Applying LEI's Lean transformation framework</h2>
			<p>LEI has found <a id="_idIndexMarker1859"/>that effective enterprise transformations involve change across five dimensions. LEI uses the metaphor of a house to explain the five dimensions of change. The components of the <em class="italic">House of Lean</em> include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">The roof</strong>—Objectives, goals, and <a id="_idIndexMarker1860"/>aspirations to protect us from the surrounding environments, such as these:<p>a. What is our value-driven purpose?</p><p>b. Every situation is different, as are our countermeasures, so our approach must be different.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">The walls</strong>—The pillars <a id="_idIndexMarker1861"/>that hold up our roof, which include the following:<p>a. <strong class="bold">Process</strong>—What is the work to be done?</p><p>b. <strong class="bold">Capability</strong>—What capabilities do we need to do the work, to solve our problem, to fulfill our purpose?</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">The foundation</strong>—This includes <a id="_idIndexMarker1862"/>our fundamental way of thinking, our mindset, and our underlying assumptions:<p>a. <strong class="bold">Explicit assumptions</strong> that we are aware of and that inform all our activities</p><p>b. <strong class="bold">Hidden assumptions</strong> that we don't know about</p><p>c. <strong class="bold">Lean transformations gap</strong> to move from our current culture to an ideal culture</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The House <a id="_idIndexMarker1863"/>of Lean helps us improve our fundamental thinking about cause and effects by asking the following questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Which <strong class="bold">problems</strong> do we need to solve?</li>
				<li>What is the <strong class="bold">purpose</strong> or goal we are trying to achieve?</li>
				<li>What is the <strong class="bold">work</strong> that needs to be done?</li>
				<li>What is the process or <strong class="bold">flow</strong> of work needed to improve our situation?</li>
				<li>What <strong class="bold">capabilities</strong> are required, and how will I grow them?</li>
				<li>Which <strong class="bold">management systems</strong> do we need to define?</li>
				<li>What <strong class="bold">behaviors</strong> are required to build the capabilities necessary to perform the work that will help us solve our problems?</li>
			</ul>

			<p>LEI partners <a id="_idIndexMarker1864"/>with other companies to apply its scientific method to seek CI to Lean transformation processes. The partnerships are formed under LEI's <strong class="bold">Co-Learning Partners program</strong>, introduced in the following subsection. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-349"><a id="_idTextAnchor429"/>Co-learning partnerships</h2>
			<p>For several <a id="_idIndexMarker1865"/>years now, LEI has partnered with a select group of companies to help them on their lean journeys and jointly conduct experiments <a id="_idIndexMarker1866"/>on the best approaches to lean transformations. Qualified partner companies get access to LEI thought leaders, such as John Shook, Jim Womack, and Mark Reich, as well as LEI coaches and <strong class="bold">subject matter experts </strong>(<strong class="bold">SMEs</strong>). </p>
			<p>Partners include traditional manufacturers applying lean methods across the entire enterprise. Still, LEI also partners with companies pioneering lean applications in a range of service industries, including retail, healthcare, and financial services.</p>
			<p>Through these partnerships, LEI maintains up-to-date and real-world knowledge from these activities, providing the basis for future LEI publications, training, and research.</p>
			<p>Co-learning partners <a id="_idIndexMarker1867"/>are making investments in their time and resources, and there has to be something in it for them. LEI cites the following benefits gained by its partner companies:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Coaching and mentoring of senior leaders</li>
				<li>Lean transformation project support</li>
				<li>Strategy planning and deployment (a.k.a. Hoshin)</li>
				<li>Customized learning opportunities</li>
				<li>Gemba-based improvement activities</li>
				<li>Action research and co-learning experiments</li>
				<li>Documented learning shared partner-to-partner and with the broader lean community (with approval)</li>
				<li>Interaction with the partner community</li>
				<li>Exclusive partner-to-partner learning activities</li>
				<li>Seats at LEI's practical how-to public workshops</li>
				<li>Seats at the informative and inspiring Lean Summit conference</li>
				<li>Discounts on books and other products</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker1868"/>find more information about the Co-Learning Partners program at the following web page: <a href="https://www.lean.org/WhoWeAre/CoLearningPartners.cfm">https://www.lean.org/WhoWeAre/CoLearningPartners.cfm</a><span class="hidden"> </span></p>
			<p>This section completes our introduction to LEI. In the next section, you will learn about LeanFITT™ and its contributions to VSM development.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-350"><a id="_idTextAnchor430"/>Training and tools from LeanFITT™</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">LeanFITT™</strong> was established <a id="_idIndexMarker1869"/>by Don Tapping, Rob Ptacek, Todd Sperl, and Abhishek Paul. From your <a id="_idIndexMarker1870"/>reading of <a href="B17087_06_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a><em class="italic">, Launching the VSM Initiative (VSM Steps 1 - 3)</em>  through<em class="italic"> </em><a href="B17087_10_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor272"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a><em class="italic">, Improving the Lean-Agile Value Delivery Cycle (VSM Steps 7 and 8)</em>, you may recall that Don Tapping and his collaborators <a id="_idIndexMarker1871"/>defined the eight-step VSM methodology used earlier in this book, which we employed as a use case to evaluate and improve CI/CD pipeline flows from a Lean-oriented perspective. </p>
			<p>As a collective effort, the LeanFITT™ team has collaborated since 2001 to author over 50 books and learning tools and materials on Lean and VSM practices. Employing knowledge gained through their collaborations, the LeanFITT company provides a set of Lean tools to support your Lean improvement initiatives. The <strong class="bold">FITT</strong> part of LeanFITT stands for <strong class="bold">Functional</strong>, <strong class="bold">Integrated</strong>, <strong class="bold">Technology</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Training</strong>.</p>
			<p>LeanFITT started as a consulting firm but evolved to develop and deliver both methods and tools to support Lean production processes. For example, under development since 2014, the LeanFITT tools consolidate the team learnings, with delivery made available using enhanced software tools. The tools facilitate Lean team collaborations with simpler approaches, compared to Lean's manual options. As a result, the LeanFITT system of tools helps organizations deploy Lean concepts more quickly and sustainably. </p>
			<p>LeanFITT's tools offer knowledge-based guidance to VSM teams, Lean practitioners, executives, and other stakeholders participating in value stream improvements. Each LeanFITT tool <a id="_idIndexMarker1872"/>provides the following features:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Detailed content explaining their purpose and practical applications  </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Sensei tips</strong> from industry Lean Sigma experts</li>
				<li>Leadership tips for leaders at all levels to better engage employees </li>
				<li>Action items that are tracked with notifications and allow for notes and pictures/photos</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The objectives of the LeanFITT tools are to harness the power of CI, employee engagement, standardized knowledge, and tool usage to inspire process changes that make a big impact. With that understanding in mind, let's review their tools.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-351"><a id="_idTextAnchor431"/>Offerings from LeanFITT™</h2>
			<p>The LeanFITT system <a id="_idIndexMarker1873"/>offers methods, tools, and techniques to improve organizational processes, people, and profits. As a complete set, the LeanFITT <a id="_idIndexMarker1874"/>system includes the following 12 tools to support their respective methods and techniques:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.4 – LeanFITT™ Lean tools</p>
			<p>Customers <a id="_idIndexMarker1875"/>can use LeanFITT tools to support their needs in an ad hoc manner. However, the company promotes a four-phased approach to implementation, which you'll learn about next. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-352"><a id="_idTextAnchor432"/>Implementing a phase-based approach to Lean improvements</h1>
			<p>The LeanFITT <a id="_idIndexMarker1876"/>system employs <a id="_idIndexMarker1877"/>a four-phased approach to make Lean improvements to organizational processes. The objectives of their LeanFITT implementation methodology are to <strong class="bold">achieve positive behavior changes</strong> toward a <strong class="bold">CI mindset</strong>, making a high level of discipline and standardization simple and easy to follow, and creating <strong class="bold">a positive shift in organizational culture and profitability</strong>.</p>
			<p>Let's take a quick look at LeanFITT's four-phase approach to creating a Lean enterprise.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-353"><a id="_idTextAnchor433"/>Phase 1 – Getting people trained and engaged</h2>
			<p>As we <a id="_idIndexMarker1878"/>discussed in <a href="B17087_06_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Launching the VSM Initiative (VSM Steps 1-3)</em>, an organization needs to make sure that the participants in the VSM initiative understand the principles of Lean. We also need to make sure the value stream is identified and that executives and stakeholders support and engage in the Lean improvement's efforts. Finally, we use the value stream mapping <a id="_idIndexMarker1879"/>activities you learned in <a href="B17087_07_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor183"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Mapping the Current State (VSM Step 4)</em>, and <a href="B17087_09_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor234"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Mapping the Future State (VSM Step 6)</em>to identify waste and eliminate this through <strong class="bold">Kaizen bursts</strong> (identified lean improvement initiatives). </p>
			<p>The LeanFITT tools used in this phase include <strong class="bold">waste walks</strong>, <strong class="bold">5S</strong>, <strong class="bold">PDCA</strong>, <strong class="bold">Kaizen projects</strong>, <strong class="bold">value stream mapping</strong>, and other tools as appropriate. Primary activities include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Identifying the key users</li>
				<li>Developing and implementing individual and team or group development and training plans</li>
				<li>Understanding the business case and identifying waste and improvement opportunities</li>
				<li>Testing your knowledge, receiving feedback, and earning rewards</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This phase <a id="_idIndexMarker1880"/>has a focus on finding and evaluating approaches to eliminate waste. As this phase winds down, the organization moves on to standardize and improve its Lean implementation processes.  </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-354"><a id="_idTextAnchor434"/>Phase 2 – Standardizing the improvement process</h2>
			<p>In this phase, the VSM team seeks to standardize its lean improvement process, leveraging <a id="_idIndexMarker1881"/>the LeanFITT tools and adding in DMAIC. DMAIC is a <strong class="bold">Six Sigma</strong>-based improvement process. </p>
			<p>A Six Sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all instances of a process or product are free of defects. Six Sigma strategies set and monitor upper and lower boundaries on process and product defect metrics to discover trends before deviations have catastrophic consequences. As deviations from the statistical norms are observed, the team quickly analyzes and addresses the causes of the variances.</p>
			<p>The LeanFITT tools used in this phase i<a id="_idTextAnchor435"/>nclude <strong class="bold">standard walks</strong>, <strong class="bold">A3</strong>, <strong class="bold">Gemba walks</strong>, <strong class="bold">5S</strong>, <strong class="bold">PDCA</strong>, <strong class="bold">DMAIC</strong>, and other tools as appropriate. Primary activities include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Implementing targeted and results-focused improvement projects</li>
				<li>Applying LeanFITT™ tools for improvements</li>
				<li>Measuring and tracking improvement progress</li>
				<li>Sharing results with others</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The activities of this phase have a focus on eliminating the waste identified in <em class="italic">Phase 1</em>. Successful elimination of waste will improve the organization's delivery of customer value. </p>
			<p>Lean improvements operate at a strategic level and organization-wide.  But, as with any business transformation initiative, change is hard. Change cannot be mandated—it has to be led and the reasons for the change must be communicated, else others within the organization will feel threatened and resist. </p>
			<p>Moreover, people generally want to join efforts and organizations that have successful outcomes. So, the executives sponsoring LeanFITT need to promote their initial successes to gain further buy-in throughout the organization. The executives also need to make opportunities available throughout the organization to train people in other value streams to apply Lean practices, methods, and tools. These are the objectives of the next phase.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-355"><a id="_idTextAnchor436"/>Phase 3 – Energizing the team with active involvement and transparency</h2>
			<p>In this third phase, the successes of previous Lean improvement efforts are socialized, and <a id="_idIndexMarker1882"/>individuals both within and leading the <a id="_idIndexMarker1883"/>initial efforts are recognized for their achievements. LeanFITT promotes the use of metrics and visibility of efforts to encourage organizational support and buy-in to the new way of working, as with any Lean initiative. These objectives are the focus of <em class="italic">Phase 3</em> activities. </p>
			<p>The LeanFITT tools used in this phase include <strong class="bold">standard walks</strong>, <strong class="bold">A3</strong>, <strong class="bold">Gemba walks</strong>, <strong class="bold">5S</strong>, <strong class="bold">PDCA</strong>, <strong class="bold">DMAIC</strong>, and other tools as appropriate. Primary activities include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Promoting and making visible the results from LeanFITT™ tool applications and projects</li>
				<li>Tracking and sharing team improvement project progress and action items</li>
				<li>Standardizing and expanding training throughout the organization</li>
				<li>Sharing success stories</li>
			</ul>
			<p>At this <a id="_idIndexMarker1884"/>point, the teams leading the Lean <a id="_idIndexMarker1885"/>improvements can take a bow for their successes. Celebrating success is a good thing. However, the organization cannot stop here. Lean is about making CI across product life cycles and across the life of the organization. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-356"><a id="_idTextAnchor437"/>Phase 4 – Making Lean routine and sustainable</h2>
			<p>Organizations that stop improving become stale and put their business at risk. Other competitors <a id="_idIndexMarker1886"/>will see opportunities to claim market share with new products, often driven by digital enhancements to products and the organization's value streams. This fourth phase seeks to sustain and even build upon your Lean-oriented competitive advantages. </p>
			<p>The LeanFITT tools used in this phase include <strong class="bold">standard walks</strong>, <strong class="bold">Gemba walks</strong>, <strong class="bold">PDCA</strong>, <strong class="bold">mistake-proofing</strong>, and other tools as appropriate. Primary activities include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Continually monitoring and adjusting progress and activities to address current needs</li>
				<li>Implementing action items to drive continual improvements</li>
				<li>Measuring and sharing tangible dollar savings and intangible savings such as improved communications and teamwork</li>
				<li>Making continual improvements and LeanFITT™ your organization's culture!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Lean and Six Sigma often address issues of quality, of which there are a host of methods and tools that support quality improvement objectives. As you might imagine, LeanFITT provides quality improvement tools in its product offerings.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-357"><a id="_idTextAnchor438"/>Improving quality with LeanFITT</h2>
			<p>LeanFITT includes <a id="_idIndexMarker1887"/>nine methods and tools for improving quality, as shown in the following sc<a id="_idTextAnchor439"/>reenshot:</p>

			<p>This section ends our discussion on LeanFITT and also this chapter on leading practices in VSM. In the next chapter, which also begins <em class="italic">Section 3</em> of this book, we will dive into the subject of DevOps once again. Before we get there, we'll end this chapter with a summary <a id="_idIndexMarker1888"/>and a list of questions to help you verify and improve your retention of the content discussed. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-358"><a id="_idTextAnchor440"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you were introduced to the two organizations that have played an instrumental role in the development of Lean practices and VSM. We began with an introduction to LEI. LEI conducts research, teaches educational workshops, publishes books and e-books, runs conferences, and shares practical information about lean thinking and practice.</p>
			<p>You were also introduced to LeanFITT. The partners who founded LeanFITT have contributed to more than 50 books on Lean practices. They also wrote some of the earliest books on VSM and were very involved in the early development of VSM practices and methodologies. </p>
			<p>We are now ready to move on to <em class="italic">Section 3</em> of this book, which describes the complexities and approaches to installing modern DevOps pipelines and toolchains. The first chapter, <a href="B17087_15_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor446"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></a>, <em class="italic">Defining the Appropriate DevOps Platform Strategy</em>, addresses two critical issues. The first issue is avoiding DevOps implementation pitfalls that all organizations face when attempting to implement a mature DevOps pipeline and toolchain strategy. The second issue is determining which DevOps platform implementation strategy is most appropriate for your organization. Specifically, you will learn about four approaches to implementing a DevOps pipeline. </p>
			<p>Finally, the last chapter, <a href="B17087_16_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor491"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a>, <em class="italic">Transforming Businesses with VSM and DevOps</em>, discusses a potential future state where modern VSM tools not only assist in improving IT-based value streams but all the organization's value streams.  </p>
