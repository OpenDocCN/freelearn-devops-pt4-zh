    methodology leaders, including the **Lean Enterprise Institute** (**LEI**) and
    **LeanFITT™**. These two organizations are included because Lean practices evolved
    separately from Agile, and these are two of the longest operating thought leaders
    behind the Lean movement.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LEI was founded in 1997 by management expert James P. Womack, Ph.D. and his
    colleague, Daniel T. Jones. Womack and Jones coined the term *value stream* in
    an article published in the *Harvard Business Review* magazine, *From Lean Production
    to the Lean Enterprise* (Womack and Jones, March-April 1994; [https://hbr.org/1994/03/from-lean-production-to-the-lean-enterprise](https://hbr.org/1994/03/from-lean-production-to-the-lean-enterprise)).
    LEI promotes on its website that the organization "*conducts research, teaches
    educational workshops, publishes books and eBooks, runs conferences, and shares
    practical information about lean thinking and practices*."

    (**VSM**) methodology used in this book ([*Chapter 6*](B17087_06_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165)*,
    Launching the VSM Initiative (VSM Steps 1 - 3)* through[*Chapter 10*](B17087_10_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor272)*,
    Improving the Lean-Agile Value Delivery Cycle (VSM Steps 7 and 8)*), as a reference
    model to make Lean-oriented improvements across a **continuous integration/continuous**
    **delivery** (**CI/CD**) pipeline flow. LeanFITT has a broader focus on VSM, improving
    all organizational value streams, not just those in **Information Technology**
    (**IT**). The LeanFITT™ team has collaborated, since 2001, in authoring more than
    50 books and learning tools and materials on VSM as a practical approach to making
    Lean improvements enterprise-wide and across any type of value stream. LeanFITT's
    founders were the original thought leaders in the early development of VSM concepts
    and methodologies.

- en: '*Our modern VSM tools-oriented industry will have a very short life if organizations
    do not fundamentally understand that VSM is not limited to making flow improvements
    to CI/CD and DevOps pipeline flows. Those are critical objectives. However, the
    much larger opportunity is to deploy our improved IT pipeline flows and resources
    to improve the products and value streams across the organization. Otherwise,
    companies will spend much money, time, and effort installing integrated, automated,
    and orchestrated toolchains only to find they have little impact on the organization''s
    bottom line and its value delivery capabilities.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At issue is the fact that improving one of the organization's value streams,
    from a systems-thinking perspective, is a form of local optimization if we don't
    look at its contribution to the system as a whole. Thus, we need to use our improved
    IT value stream delivery capabilities to drive improvements across the organization's
    other value streams. We do that by using the same VSM methods taught in this book
    but applied across all organizational value streams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the process, we will find that many potential value stream improvements have
    an information, integration, automation, and orchestration component that IT can
    address. So, the justifications to our investments in improving IT CI/CD and **development-operations**
    (**DevOps**) pipelines are not derived from the accelerated delivery of software,
    at least not in a vacuum. Instead, the larger justifications come from using software
    to accelerate Lean-oriented improvements across all organizational value streams.

- en: In [*Chapter 7*](B17087_07_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor183), *Mapping the
    Current State (VSM Step 4)*, the VSM team selected improvements to a CI/CD pipeline
    as its high-priority Lean improvement initiative. The purpose of that selection
    was to highlight that IT can be the exclusive subject of a VSM improvement initiative.
    However, the VSM team could have easily selected another organizational value
    stream, where improvements to the CI/CD pipeline were one of the identified Kaizen
    Bursts (improvements) necessary to improve work and information flows within the
    targeted value stream.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, we need to employ a generic VSM methodology and let the organization's
    strategic goals, portfolio investment priorities, and current state-future state
    analysis lead to identify and select our Lean improvement objectives. Since Lean
    production improvements are the operative concepts behind VSM, we shouldn't have
    different VSM approaches for different value streams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, it should be apparent that the importance of LEI and LeanFITT organizations
    is not related to leveraging the power of modern VSM tools. Instead, they have
    laid the groundwork on using VSM as an approach to improve all organizational
    value streams, including those in IT, to efficiently deliver value in support
    of the mission and priorities of the business.

    found company line managers and executives are "*given a set of key metrics --
    each with a stretch goal for this year -- and motivated by a bonus to reach the

    an article titled *Value Stream Management*. In this article, which coincided
    with the ending of the so-called "Great Recession", Jones discusses the "*growing
    impact of the web in opening up the possibility of turning customers from strangers
    to partners*." The premise of his article is that the web establishes a closer
    connection to our customers, turning them into demanding partners. Specifically,
    these customers demand that we "*deliver exactly what they want, when, where and
    how they want it and to significantly improve the experience of using these products
    and services while minimizing the impact on the environment*".
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Still, when he wrote the article, many companies had 200- to 300-day supply
    chains, and retailers could respond to their customers' demands. Jones found that
    suppliers highlighted 98% service delivery levels, but in reality, they were only
    accepting ~70% of their retailers' orders. The only way to close this gap is to
    apply VSM concepts to decrease supply chain lead times from months to days.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, Jones notes the greatest obstacle to the successful application to
    VSM is because "*functions, departments and business units have become too powerful
    and act in their own interests.*" In other words, organizations ignore the voice
    of the customer to support functional, bureaucratic, and self-serving interests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Jones' observations are not much different from those made by Womack in his
    article 7 years earlier. Putting the control of value delivery into the hands
    of hierarchical and functional departments takes the focus away from the flow
    of value from the perspective of the organization's customers. Jones notes that
    the best way forward requires rebalancing the power of functional organizations
    by introducing value stream analysis and VSM. We also need to apply scientific
    methods of experimentation to resolve problems and find better ways to design
    the management systems necessary to create and sustain new systemic solutions
    to our development, operations, and supply chain delivery problems.

    the customer through a perfect value creation process with zero waste.

- en: Lean thinking changes the focus of management from optimizing separate technologies,
    assets, and vertical departments to optimizing the flow of products and services
    through entire value streams that flow horizontally across technologies, assets,
    and departments to customers. Eliminating waste along entire value streams creates
    processes that need less human effort, less space, less capital, and less time
    to make products and services at far lower cost and with much fewer defects than
    traditional business systems. Companies can also respond to changing customer
    desires with high variety, high quality, low cost, and decreased throughput times.
    Also, information management becomes much simpler and more accurate.

    *Launching the VSM Initiative (VSM Steps 1-3)*, an organization needs to make
    sure that the participants in the VSM initiative understand the principles of
    Lean. We also need to make sure the value stream is identified and that executives
    and stakeholders support and engage in the Lean improvement's efforts. Finally,
    we use the value stream mapping activities you learned in [*Chapter 7*](B17087_07_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor183),
    *Mapping the Current State (VSM Step 4)*, and [*Chapter 9*](B17087_09_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor234),
