			<p>In this final chapter, you will learn how to use <a id="_idTextAnchor492"/><strong class="bold">value stream management</strong> (<strong class="bold">VSM</strong>) and DevOps tools and related implementation initiatives to transform businesses into viable entities to compete in our digital economy. But there are two parts to making digital transformations. In part one, we need to transform our software delivery capabilities to support the organization's business transformations at large. In part two, we use our transformed software delivery capabilities to improve the way we build and deliver products across our value streams. </p>
			<p>In other words, we must connect the software delivery improvements achieved through our DevOps-related VSM initiatives to support the needs of our broader enterprise VSM initiatives. But such connections are not automatic. From the perspective of systems thinking, improving software development capabilities apart from the intersecting value delivery needs of the business is a form of local optimization. The only way an organization will see an adequate ROI from its VSM and DevOps tools investments is to use its enhanced software delivery capabilities to improve its value delivery capabilities across the organization. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will learn how to align VSM and DevOps tool investments with corporate strategies and portfolio investments. We'll work through that topic in a stepwise approach. With that objective in mind, the topics covered in this chapter include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a id="_idTextAnchor493"/>Uniting VSM initiatives</li>
				<li>Using VSM for DevOps improvements</li>
				<li>Connecting to enterprise VSM initiatives</li>
				<li>Using OKRs to drive business transformations</li>
				<li>Aligning VSM initiatives with strategies and portfolios</li>
				<li><a id="_idTextAnchor494"/>Expanding the vision for the VSM tool industry</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Note that the last topic will introduce a future vision for the VSM tool industry. It would be easy to read current documentation and press releases from VSM tool vendors and believe that their tools provide out-of-the-box solutions to have end-to-end visibility across all value streams. That's not really true today. Modern VSM tools provide end-to-end visibility of the activities that support software delivery pipelines. The VSM tool vision can be expanded to integrate all organizational development and operational value streams in the long run. I've included this topic as a call to VSM tool vendors to make that vision a reality.</p>
			<p>Let's get started on understanding how to transform our businesses into competitive digital enterprises through VSM. We'll begin with a discussion on what it means to unite VSM initiatives, and why taking such actions are important.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-402"><a id="_idTextAnchor495"/>Uniting VSM initiatives</h1>
			<p>Lean concepts are not new. For example, arguments <a id="_idIndexMarker2100"/>could be made that Henry Ford's Model T production assembly lines embodied several of the concepts applied in modern Lean practices. For example, Ford created continuous and streamlined flows across automotive assembly lines and sequenced parts to arrive just before assembly. But it was the founder and future leaders of Toyota who took these concepts to the next level, led by these three individuals primarily:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Sakichi Toyoda</strong> – Toyota's founder<p>Developed and implemented the <a id="_idIndexMarker2101"/>concepts behind <strong class="bold">Jidoka</strong> – <em class="italic">automation with a human touch</em> – as the means to facilitate quality at the source.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kiichiro Toyota</strong> – Sakichi Toyoda's son<p>Founded the <em class="italic">Toyota Motor Corporation</em> and developed <strong class="bold">just-in-time</strong> (<strong class="bold">JIT</strong>) concepts <a id="_idIndexMarker2102"/>for manufacturing.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Taichi Ohno</strong> – Shop-floor supervisor, industrial engineer, and executive at Toyota<p>Integrated Toyota's JIT system with its Jidoka System, defined the Kanban system, and established the principles behind Kaizen (continuous improvements). Ohno is also credited with defining many of the elements embodied <a id="_idIndexMarker2103"/>in the <strong class="bold">Toyota Production System</strong> (<strong class="bold">TPS</strong>) such as pull-oriented production systems, the <a id="_idIndexMarker2104"/>elimination of waste, <strong class="bold">Quick Die changes</strong> (<strong class="bold">SMED</strong>), non-value-added work, U-shaped work cells, and single-piece flows.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>What eventually became known as <em class="italic">The Toyota Way</em> had such a profound impact on global competition in manufacturing that it was widely studied and duplicated as the means to survive in increasingly competitive global markets. The term <strong class="bold">Lean</strong> comes out of <a id="_idIndexMarker2105"/>research <a id="_idIndexMarker2106"/>conducted by the <strong class="bold">International Motor Vehicle Program</strong> (<strong class="bold">IMVP</strong>) at the <strong class="bold">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</strong> (<strong class="bold">MIT</strong>) under the direction of James P. Womack. John Krafcik, a researcher at IMVP, coined the term Lean Production, which is at the heart of VSM. Beyond these pioneers came many practitioners and experts who further expanded the use of Lean production practices.</p>
			<p>The bottom line is <a id="_idIndexMarker2107"/>that people who know about Lean already know about value stream mapping and VSM – but in a broader context across other organizational development and operational value streams. Moreover, they have been applying these methods for decades! </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-403"><a id="_idTextAnchor496"/>Diverging customer-centric development strategies</h2>
			<p>Still, Lean practices in <a id="_idIndexMarker2108"/>software development and VSM are relatively new as mainstream software <a id="_idIndexMarker2109"/>development concepts. While other domains and industries focused on Lean production practices to improve their customer-centric value delivery capabilities, the software community focused on implementing Agile-based strategies. Though Lean and Agile practices both focus on improving customer-oriented delivery of value and making continuous improvements, the early advocates of Agile set out to solve a different set of problems.</p>
			<p>For example, Toyota sought to improve quality and efficiencies in an island nation, coming out of the Great Depression and then World War II, where access to resources was limited and expensive. Toyota's means of being competitive in its global markets was to build higher-quality products with fewer resources and simultaneously ensure they built only the products customers wanted when they wanted them. They became so good at this that the rest of the world's manufacturing industries had to respond in kind to survive. Other industries quickly followed the Lean trend.</p>
			<p>In contrast, Agile came out of the software development community, and its advocates were solving a different set of problems. Specifically, the traditional project management model was not sufficiently responsive to address the evolving needs and priorities of businesses and their customers. So, Agile began as a set of values and principles to support the needs of small software development teams to become more responsive and adaptable. In the process, Agile evolved to implement iterative and incremental development practices that leveraged prototyping and empiricism to create working solutions with customer-directed inputs quickly. </p>
			<p>But now, we see <a id="_idIndexMarker2110"/>the concepts <a id="_idIndexMarker2111"/>behind Lean and Agile beginning to merge, often characterized as implementing Lean-Agile practices. This topic is essential as Lean-Agile is the basis of the VSM Consortium's approach to implementing VSM tools as the means to improve DevOps-based software delivery capabilities. We'll discuss this in the upcoming section titled <em class="italic">Using VSM for DevOps improvements</em>. However, before we get to that topic, let's revisit what the modern VSM tool industry means when it uses the term VSM.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-404"><a id="_idTextAnchor497"/>Defining VSM as a modern software tools category</h2>
			<p>In its modern <a id="_idIndexMarker2112"/>contextual usage, VSM is a tools-driven strategy to support VSM practices to implement Lean-oriented improvements across CI/CD and DevOps pipeline activities. A casual search on the internet might lead us to think this is the only meaning behind VSM as the most recent information on VSM primarily came out of the VSM and DevOps tools industries.</p>
			<p>For example, Forrester – in its New Wave™ article titled <em class="italic">Value Stream Management Tools Q3 2018</em>, defines VSM as follows:</p>
			<p class="author-quote">VSM is an emerging tool category that connects an organization's business to its software delivery capability. VSM tools provide multiple roles — product managers, developers, QA, and release managers — a view into planning, health indicators, and analytics, helping them collaborate more effectively to reduce waste and focus on work that delivers value to the customer and the business.</p>
			<p>However, recall that <em class="italic">Section 1</em>, <em class="italic">Value Delivery</em>, and <em class="italic">Section 2</em>, <em class="italic">VSM Methodology</em>, of this book introduced the original concepts behind VSM as a generic Lean-improvement strategy and methodology. It's essential to distinguish between the traditional and modern VSM concepts here, as the fusion of the two VSM approaches is the best way forward to <a id="_idIndexMarker2113"/>align our organization's resources to compete in a digital economy. With this understanding firmly in mind, we can now learn how and why we must fuse the traditional and modern VSM concepts.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-405"><a id="_idTextAnchor498"/>Using VSM for DevOps improvements</h1>
			<p>In <a href="B17087_05_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor126"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Driving Business Value through a DevOps Pipeline</em>, you learned how to apply a generic <a id="_idIndexMarker2114"/>eight-step <a id="_idIndexMarker2115"/>VSM methodology to any VSM improvement initiative. We used that same eight-step approach in our CI/CD pipeline improvement use case in <a href="B17087_06_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Launching the VSM Initiative (VSM Steps 1-3)</em>, through <a href="B17087_10_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor272"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Improving the Lean-Agile Value Delivery Cycle (VSM Steps 7 and 8)</em>. There is no reason we cannot use that same eight-step methodology to guide DevOps pipeline improvements.</p>
			<p>Still, the VSM Consortium recommends a slightly different roadmap for VSM implementations related to making improvements across DevOps activities and toolchains, as shown in the following figure:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer163" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_16.1.jpg" alt="Figure 16.1 – VSM Consortium – A VSM Implementation Roadmap&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.1 – VSM Consortium – A VSM Implementation Roadmap</p>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker2116"/>VSM Implementation Roadmap, you <a id="_idIndexMarker2117"/>can see similarities to both Lean and Agile improvement concepts. In fact, it's an amalgamation of both practices.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-406"><a id="_idTextAnchor499"/>Implementing the Lean aspects of the VSM roadmap</h2>
			<p>The VSM Consortium's VSM Implementation Roadmap begins by identifying value streams, locating, and organizing the people <a id="_idIndexMarker2118"/>who are accountable for each value stream activity, mapping both the current and desired future states, and connecting the DevOps toolchains to the activities in the value stream. Then, depending upon the selected <strong class="bold">value stream management platform</strong> (<strong class="bold">VSMP</strong>) in use, the <a id="_idIndexMarker2119"/>DevOps toolchain integration can serve multiple roles, including integrating, automating, and orchestrating value stream activities spanning software development, security, and compliance.</p>
			<p>However, the larger objective is to use the VSMP and its integrations with DevOps tools to capture real-time and end-to-end data across the identified software delivery value stream. Using a common and normalized data model, the value stream managers, team members, organizational executives, and other stakeholders have real-time visibility into software production flows, allowing them to observe and determine the cause of bottlenecks and waiting.</p>
			<p>So, the primary difference between this part of the VSM Consortium's VSM Implementation Roadmap and the generic eight-step VSM methodology is the integration of software tools to capture end-to-end data in the value stream without the need for human intervention or manual data collection. Another key differentiator is the use of analytical tools, which we'll get into in the following subsection.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-407"><a id="_idTextAnchor500"/>Implementing the Agile aspects of the VSM roadmap</h2>
			<p>The next <a id="_idIndexMarker2120"/>two steps in the VSM Consortium's VSM Implementation Roadmap involve <strong class="bold">inspection</strong> and <strong class="bold">adaption</strong>. Scrum advocates will immediately recognize these two steps from Scrum's three empirical pillars of <strong class="bold">transparency</strong>, <strong class="bold">inspection</strong>, and <strong class="bold">adaptation</strong>.</p>
			<p>In the previous subsection, you learned that VSMP products support the integration, automation, and orchestration of value stream activities. But the tools also give us visibility of work and information flows across our DevOps pipelines. So, though the term is not explicitly cited, the VSM Consortium has not ignored Scrum's pillar of <em class="italic">Transparency</em>. What is unique in the VSM tool industry is replacing the manual aspects of collecting and reporting data via its platforms and tools, which is enabled in the <em class="italic">Connect</em> step through the VSMP-DevOps toolchain integrations.</p>
			<p>Now that we have <a id="_idIndexMarker2121"/>real-time visibility across DevOps pipeline flows, the DevOps teams can <em class="italic">Inspect</em> the pipeline to inform their retrospective meetings with accurate and current information. We can use the insights gathered from the inspections and retrospectives to develop one or more hypotheses for potential solutions and perform experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of identified alternatives against our goals. Finally, we can <em class="italic">Adapt</em> our DevOps system based on our experiential findings. </p>
			<p>So, from the <em class="italic">Start</em> through <em class="italic">Adapt</em> steps, the VSM Implementation Roadmap marries the best practices of both Lean and Agile into a seamless framework. This brings us to the last step, <em class="italic">Vision</em>. As it turns out, this is a critical step in Lean-Agile practices.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-408"><a id="_idTextAnchor501"/>Establishing a business transformation vision</h2>
			<p>Recall that Agile evolved as a <a id="_idIndexMarker2122"/>set of values and principles by software engineers and consultants to be more responsive to evolving customer needs and priorities. But Agile also evolved primarily as a small teams-oriented development philosophy where incremental changes are evaluated over each development iteration – based on the team's experiences from the previous Sprint. In other words, Agile-based improvements tend to be limited to very short planning horizons – measured in 1 to 4 weeks and limited to the budgets and authorities granted to the development team.</p>
			<p>In contrast, Lean improvements often view changes across multiple planning horizons that span, potentially, several fiscal years and involve changes and budgets requiring executive-level sponsorship and commitment authorities. In fact, investments in both VSM and DevOps tools involve organizational investments and business operations, and cultural changes that small software development teams cannot authorize. Therefore, investments on this scale must support the strategies of the business, receive executive-level support, and fit within the organization's portfolio-level investments and priorities.</p>
			<p>So, <em class="italic">Vision</em> as a VSM implementation step becomes vital to align the VSM and DevOps implementation objectives with the business strategies to gain executive support and prioritize budget allocations. And the only way that's going to happen is if the executives see how the improvements to software deliveries can improve the company's product deliveries across all organizational value streams.</p>
			<p>Now that we <a id="_idIndexMarker2123"/>understand how Lean and Agile concepts come together in the <em class="italic">VSM Implementation Roadmap</em> as a tools and DevOps-based software delivery improvement strategy, let's take a step back to look at the importance people play in the implementation and use of these tools.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-409"><a id="_idTextAnchor502"/>Implementing tools is not a replacement for people</h2>
			<p>Having access to <a id="_idIndexMarker2124"/>real-time data across your DevOps pipelines does not remove the need to have executives and managers performing <em class="italic">Gemba</em> walks, especially in large software development initiatives involving multiple teams. The people performing the day-to-day work across these DevOps pipelines have the greatest knowledge about how and why work is performed and the issues that interfere with their workflow. In a modern VSM tools context, Gemba walks are explorations that can involve both virtual and face-to-face data gathering and communication activities.</p>
			<p>Similar to how Gemba was explained in the section titled <em class="italic">Going to see (Gemba)</em> in <a href="B17087_07_Final_PD_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor183"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Mapping the Current State (VSM Step 4)</em>, the VSM members or VSM manager and executives can chat with the DevOps team members to ask the following questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ask the DevOps team members to describe the problems they experience with the way software development work is currently performed.<p>- Note that most people tend to avoid discussing difficult subjects or express opinions they believe others don't want to hear.</p><p>- Managers need to dive deeper to get past the superficial yet visible issues and get to the real problems that affect team performance and software deliveries.</p></li>
				<li>Next, ask the team members what they think are the root causes of the problems and show evidence to support their reasoning (<strong class="bold">Transparency</strong>). </li>
				<li>When the root cause is uncovered, next, ask the DevOps team members what should be done to resolve the issues and why.</li>
				<li>Then ask the DevOps team members how they will know if the problem is resolved.<p>- What evidence will clearly indicate the problem is resolved?</p><p>- What data and metrics can serve as indicators of successful outcomes and improvements?</p></li>
				<li>Finally, investigate the alternative recommended solutions through experimentation and inspection, and adapt to the approach that provides the most value.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You now understand the <a id="_idIndexMarker2125"/>value of managers and executives going out to see what's going on and the kinds of questions they must ask of the DevOps team members. But, in many cases, the issues may require specialized skills and a team approach to resolve them. In those cases, the organization should establish a VSM team to conduct the analysis and manage the VSM initiative.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-410"><a id="_idTextAnchor503"/>Creating a VSM team for DevOps transformations</h2>
			<p>Creating a VSM team, just as <a id="_idIndexMarker2126"/>we would for any other type of VSM initiative, helps to guide DevOps-oriented software delivery value stream improvement investments and activities. Moreover, larger software products involving multiple development and support teams make it critical to stand up a dedicated VSM team to guide the overarching initiative.</p>
			<p>It could be possible that a non-IT VSM team – one that's guiding an organization's development or operational value streams improvements – identifies the need to improve or align the software development delivery capabilities in support of their value stream. In such cases, the original VSM team can guide the DevOps-oriented improvements for their value stream, but their team must also include experts on DevOps activities and tools. </p>
			<p>Regardless of which approach the organization takes, the VSM team takes on the responsibility for guiding the improvements in software delivery capabilities to meet the needs of the value stream. This alignment is easier to accomplish when the assigned VSM team supports one of the organization's development and operational value streams as its VSM initiative. </p>
			<p>In contrast, a VSM team that supports DevOps as a standalone value stream must recognize that they must ultimately align the DevOps team to support high-priority improvements in other organizational value streams. By way of an analogy, it's hard to hit a target if you don't know what you are aiming at. So, the DevOps-oriented VSM team can take on that responsibility, working with the organization's portfolio managers, product owners, and other value stream managers to identify high-priority software development needs. </p>
			<p>This subsection <a id="_idIndexMarker2127"/>concludes our discussion on using VSM for DevOps-based improvements to software delivery capabilities. In the next section, we will look at how the DevOps VSM initiatives support an organization's digital business transformations. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-411"><a id="_idTextAnchor504"/>Connecting to enterprise VSM initiatives</h1>
			<p>In this section, you'll learn <a id="_idIndexMarker2128"/>how to connect traditional VSM methods with modern VSM tool applications and DevOps to support digital business transformations. You've learned throughout this book that organizations can use modern VSM tools to improve their DevOps-based software value delivery capabilities. However, organizations can and should also continue implementing traditional VSM initiatives to identify digital improvement opportunities across all other organizational value streams. </p>
			<p>Let's look at <em class="italic">Figure 16.2 – DevOps pipeline providing digital improvements to manufacturing pipeline flows</em> to show how this strategy works. A traditional VSM initiative has identified three potential digital enhancements (Kaizen Bursts) within a manufacturing-oriented pipeline in this scenario. It doesn't really matter for this example as to what they might be, but they might include any of the following types of digital enhancements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Improved product order and materials information across manufacturing pipeline activities.</li>
				<li>Improved access to shop floor/manufacturing process information.</li>
				<li>Re-programming robotics and automated manufacturing systems to improve performance or reduce setup times.</li>
				<li>Implement automated quality inspection systems.</li>
				<li>Implement programming on an automated paint process.</li>
				<li>Improvements to align labeling and shipping instructions with products.</li>
				<li>Improvements to supply chain management systems to support JIT delivery requirements.</li>
				<li>Other digital enhancements.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The VSM team <a id="_idIndexMarker2129"/>meets with the DevOps team to explain their requirements and priorities, informing their product backlog. The DevOps pipeline can technically be at any stage of maturity. Regardless, based on priorities, the approved digital enhancements make their way through the pipeline into production and must be supported and potentially modified over the life of the manufacturing product line:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer164" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17087_Figure_16.2.jpg" alt="Figure 16.2 – DevOps pipeline providing digital improvements to manufacturing pipeline flows&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.2 – DevOps pipeline providing digital improvements to manufacturing pipeline flows</p>
			<p>The prioritized Kaizen Burst (improvement opportunities) identified in the organization's traditional <a id="_idIndexMarker2130"/>VSM initiatives, working across all development and operational value streams, provide the information necessary to understand where digital transformations have the most positive impact on the business's operations. In this example, organizations use VSM methods strategically as a lean-oriented improvement technique to identify, assess, and prioritize where they can eliminate waste and streamline their value stream activities through digital transformations. </p>
			<p>After reading this book, you should be fully aware that the strategic VSM initiatives identify many types of improvement opportunities to eliminate waste and streamline value stream flows, some of which may not require software-based solutions or enhancements. However, software and associated computing and network systems are at the heart of most product and value stream improvements in our digital economy. And we employ VSM tools to improve DevOps pipelines to support the digital improvement needs identified across all other organizational VSM initiatives.</p>
			<p>We can direct our <a id="_idIndexMarker2131"/>improved DevOps software delivery capabilities to eliminate waste and streamline flows across all organizational value streams. But, more often than not, it is those strategic VSM initiatives that help the organization identify strategic improvement opportunities – digital or otherwise. The recommendations ultimately require executive support and consideration for investment prioritization by the lean portfolio management function. </p>
			<p>Suppose a software development team or a value stream manager takes shortcuts to circumvent the organization's budget approval processes. In that case, they will fail to obtain the management and financial support required for success. A small development team might find a way to fund their DevOps implementation as a standalone, but that's not a scalable process. And they might fail to deliver sufficient value to justify the effort or justify the expansion of their efforts.</p>
			<p>As discussed in the introduction to this chapter, improving software delivery capabilities in isolation of other organizational value stream needs is a form of local optimization from a systems thinking perspective. We can expend a lot of time, effort, and money and not see a justifiable return on investment.</p>
			<p>Here's an example of why this is the case. Measurements across a fully integrated, automated, and orchestrated DevOps pipeline have cycle times measured in microseconds – something your connected VSM tools will quickly point out. Much of the overall lead time delays come from the <em class="italic">fuzzy frontend</em> activities associated with product conceptualization, requirements, and design. But once the requirements, acceptance criteria, and design issues are sorted, and a feature moves into production, most of the cycle time events can be measured in minutes or less. </p>
			<p>So, a mature DevOps-based software development pipeline is not going to be a bottleneck in an organization's value streams. The assumption, of course, is that the DevOps pipeline improvement activities have already resolved budgeting and approval issues for tools and created reusable configurations for standing up testing environments and executing CI/CD pipeline activities. </p>
			<p>None of the initial <a id="_idIndexMarker2132"/>DevOps pipeline improvement activities comes quickly or easily. The organization's IT function needs to invest time and resources in the effort. They will also need to obtain executive support and buy-in to scale DevOps capabilities across the enterprise. </p>
			<p>There are three general scenarios in which DevOps enhanced software deliveries support an organization's business objectives, as shown in the list that follows: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>To produce standalone software products – for external customers</li>
				<li>Enhancements to physical products – such as the nav and control systems in modern automobiles</li>
				<li>Value stream improvements – to improve value delivery capabilities across operational value streams</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is not the objective of the previous list to conflate the use of software products with value streams. Instead, the objective is to note the ubiquitous nature of software across all types of development and operational value streams.</p>
			<p>I've elaborated on this same point throughout this book to make it clear: I believe organizations must have two parallel VSM efforts going on at all times: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>VSM initiatives to improve software delivery capabilities</li>
				<li>VSM initiatives to support Lean improvements across the enterprise</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Corporate-sponsored VSM initiatives operate across all development and organizational value streams to support continuous lean improvements – some/many of which will require digital enhancements to affect the desired value-added changes. So, while the VSM improvements for software delivery are vital, the real value of those improvements comes from aligning software delivery to support digital improvements across the enterprise. And those improvement opportunities are identified and prioritized across the organization's value streams through corporate-sponsored VSM initiatives.</p>
			<p>Moreover, it should be a focus of VSM teams and their initiatives to identify areas where IT can improve product value, eliminate waste, and improve value stream flows – and the assigned DevOps team ca<a id="_idTextAnchor505"/>n help with these assessments. The software industry is becoming increasingly aware of the importance of aligning its efforts with product teams and value streams. For example, the VSM Consortium's initial report, due to be released in July 2021, found that nearly 40% (37.36%) of its respondents reported working in a product, feature, component, or stream-aligned team: <a href="https://www.vsmconsortium.org/">https://www.vsmconsortium.org/</a>.</p>
			<p>You now know to <a id="_idIndexMarker2133"/>align your DevOps-based VSM initiatives to support the organization's other value streams. In the following two sections, you will learn how to connect with those other value streams through the organization's strategic <strong class="bold">Objectives and Key Results</strong> (<strong class="bold">OKRs</strong>) and portfolio management. We'll start with the discussion on OKRs.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-412"><a id="_idTextAnchor506"/>Using OKRs to drive business transformations</h1>
			<p>The concepts <a id="_idIndexMarker2134"/>behind OKRs were created by Andy Grove, the former CEO of Intel, whose leader transformed <a id="_idIndexMarker2135"/>the company into the world's largest semiconductor company. Early advocates of OKRs, first at Intel, followed by other technology companies, including Google. The employment of OKRs by Intel and Google was chronicled in the book <em class="italic">Measure What Matters</em>, by John Doerr (Doerr, 2017). </p>
			<p>John Doerr learned about the use of OKRs from Andy Grove as an employee at Intel before he left to become a venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins. During his tenure with Kleiner Perkins, he taught the principles behind OKRs to the companies he invested in, including Google.</p>
			<p>OKRs are fairly simple in concept. <strong class="bold">Objectives</strong> state what is to be achieved by the organization, while <strong class="bold">Key Results</strong> are the targets we set and monitor as objective measures of successful outcomes. More than a set of goals and measurements, OKRs serve as a management methodology and a framework to focus the company's efforts.</p>
			<p>Results must be quantifiable, measurable, and verifiable. In other words, we use real numbers for stating objectives, not fuzzy verbiage that can't be measured or proven. In short, with well-defined OKRs, there can be no doubt across the organization about whether we achieved our objectives or not.</p>
			<p>OKRs are also time-bound, usually with quarterly objectives, though some organizations may implement monthly objectives. It's possible to have long-lived objectives, perhaps spanning a year or more in duration. Still, the key results may be monitored and rolled up over no more than a quarterly basis.</p>
			<p>OKRs are not <a id="_idIndexMarker2136"/>hidden from sight. They are made visible to all employees and stakeholders. If people don't <a id="_idIndexMarker2137"/>know what targets the organization is shooting for, how will they know where they are going and if they get there? OKRs guide everyone's efforts.</p>
			<p>The objectives of an OKR are not meant to be easy. Instead, they should be achievable and yet challenging. And, as noted above, the objectives need to be specific, clearly stated, quantifiable, and visible. The ideal is to set stretch goals that inspire the organization through its people to achieve great things.  </p>
			<p>By now, you may be wondering why we are discussing OKRs in a book about applying methods and tools for VSM and DevOps. The answer is that OKRs help drive corporate strategies, portfolio priorities and investment decisions, and ultimately VSM metrics.</p>
			<p>For example, a corporate objective might be to deliver a new software product enhancement to support a niche market opportunity. Our measurable <strong class="bold">key results</strong> (<strong class="bold">KRs</strong>) might include the following:</p>

				<li><strong class="bold">KR #3</strong>: Sell 100 new software licenses in the first month of release and 400 total licenses by the end of the second quarter.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Did you notice that only <em class="italic">KR #1</em> has anything to do with software development? The other two dealt with sales and marketing support, which are part of the organization's operational value streams. That type of scenario will be typical in any strategic VSM initiative.</p>
			<p>We might include other key results to describe reseller or other value stream improvement objectives and desired results. In general, an OKR will have between 3 and 5 key results.</p>
			<p>Another important set of metrics <a id="_idIndexMarker2138"/>used by organizations are <strong class="bold">Key Performance Indicators</strong> (<strong class="bold">KPIs</strong>). It's essential to understand the distinction between KPIs and OKRs. For example, KPIs focus on performance measurements for individuals and teams or groups of people against their goals. As a result, KPIs tend to focus on tactical objectives, whereas OKRs support strategic goals. </p>
			<p>Using the <a id="_idIndexMarker2139"/>preceding example, we <a id="_idIndexMarker2140"/>strategically introduced a new product variant to open up a new market niche. The key results help the organization understand the expectations. But they also provide an idea of which value streams are most affected. We can now use our VSM initiatives to guide the improvement efforts required to meet the objectives.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-413"><a id="_idTextAnchor507"/>Aligning VSM initiatives with strategies and portfolios</h1>
			<p>VSM initiatives <a id="_idIndexMarker2141"/>support strategic goals and objectives. This is true regardless of whether a VSM team is evaluating improvements to software deliveries through the implementation of DevOps pipeline capabilities or any of a myriad of other organizational value stream improvements. They are strategic because many of the improvement opportunities identified will involve investments and timeframes beyond what a small value stream team can authorize.</p>
			<p>The chief executives will not support large investments that do not align with the business's mission, vision, and strategies. Larger enterprises will (or should) have more formal budgeting procedures than smaller entities. But regardless of size, the chief executives must have a mechanism to evaluate and prioritize investments. When viewed from this perspective, it should be apparent that VSM and DevOps tool investments compete against all the other potential investments under evaluation by the organization at large.</p>
			<p>Since this is a book on VSM and not portfolio management, we will only touch briefly on this subject. However, the primary purpose of portfolio management is to centralize and control the budgeting and investments process so that organizations can evaluate all improvement opportunities and their priorities in the context of corporate strategies. </p>
			<p>By their very nature, improvement opportunities tend to be project-oriented in nature. That is to say, they are characterized as having relatively short-term durations with defined beginning and end dates. The work is often relatively unique and standalone as one-off change endeavors. The executives make their budgeting and priority decisions based on return on investment criteria, so the improvement projects have precisely defined schedules, resources, and budget constraints. </p>
			<p>As a result, portfolio management <a id="_idIndexMarker2142"/>practices often spawned traditional projects and programs to manage the approved work. However, with the move to Lean-Agile practices, organizations move to implement Lean Portfolio Management concepts, such as those implemented by the Scaled Agile Framework® (SAFe®). Specifically, SAFe's Lean Portfolio Management process applies Lean and systems thinking approaches to strategy and investment funding, Agile portfolio operations, and governance. </p>
			<p>You now have a general understanding of the portfolio management approach to evaluating, prioritizing, and approving budgets to support the improvement opportunities identified in the organization's VSM initiatives. You also know how to apply VSM methods and tools to improve value deliveries across the organization. Now let's move on to understand how the results of our VSM initiatives, no matter how successful, can fail over time without continued executive support, training, and Lean-oriented improvements over the organization's life.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-414"><a id="_idTextAnchor508"/>Understanding how VSM initiatives can fail over time</h1>
			<p>While performing research for this book, I had a conversation with Todd Sperl – one of the founders of <strong class="bold">LeanFITT</strong>™, that I <a id="_idIndexMarker2143"/>found both interesting and disturbing. He noted several examples where an organization makes investments in VSM initiatives and sees great and sometimes fantastic results, only to see the whole thing come apart a few years down the road. Moreover, he noted that when the organizations start to fail, they often fail harder and more quickly than it took to turn them into high-performing enterprises. In fact, they often end up performing below the levels they started at before moving to Lean. How does that happen?</p>
			<p>I had discussions on this topic with Todd and later with Al Shalloway – the developer of PMI's FLEX. It's an interesting phenomenon and one that probably requires specific research to understand fully. But a common denominator appears to be new management coming in and not understanding how the organization changed its practices, behaviors, and culture to support improved horizontal flows of delivering value.</p>
			<p>Sometimes the <a id="_idIndexMarker2144"/>new management comes in through an acquisition. In other words, the success of the Lean company makes it an acquisition target. Still, the new executives fail to appreciate the Lean-oriented operations and structures that contributed to its success.</p>
			<p>Instead, the new executives are often more familiar and comfortable managing the vertical silos that form around traditional business functions and domains, such as marketing, sales, manufacturing, HR, legal, accounting, transport, and warehousing. Moreover, the horizontal flow of value across domains is difficult to see; and seemingly much more difficult to manage than managing resources aligned with business domains and functions. </p>
			<p><em class="italic">Figure 16.3</em> superimposes the horizontal flows of a value stream map against a traditional vertical organizational chart. Again, it's easy to see that there is no direct correlation between these incongruent views of managing an organization:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer165" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.3 – Vertical organizational structures against horizontal workflows</p>
			<p>As a result, the <a id="_idIndexMarker2145"/>change back to managing vertical silos instead of managing product flows is an immediate killer for the organization's performance. First, barriers quickly build between the disparate groups that must work together to maintain the horizontal value delivery flows. Then, the processes that supported horizontal activity flows quickly dissolve and fail. At that point, the organization metaphorically finds itself back to fighting an endless series of fires it cannot put out. At that point, things are so broken that the organization begins to fail on a massive scale.</p>
			<p>We can never fix value delivery problems within vertical silos. Instead, we must install horizontal collaborations and improve work and information flows, and that process takes time and effort to accomplish. But, appropriately executed, there is no rational reason to go back to managing vertical domains instead of continuing along the path of managing product-oriented horizontal flows.</p>
			<p>By way of an analogy, though it may take many months or even years to construct a building, we can bring it down in a matter of hours with explosives and heavy equipment. Managers who go backward to implement traditional management practices and vertical functional silos bring the explosives and heavy equipment that quickly bring down our Lean production flows.</p>
			<p>The bottom-line learning point for new executives, shareholders, and board members is to be careful when acquiring a Lean-oriented company that is already doing well. They must take the time to understand why and how it works before imposing new management structures. </p>
			<p>This section <a id="_idIndexMarker2146"/>completes our discussion on fusing traditional and modern VSM initiatives to support business transformations. However, before closing this book, let's address a potential future state for the VSM tool industry and the benefits all organizations would derive from this new and expanded vision to apply VSM tools. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-415"><a id="_idTextAnchor509"/>Expanding the vision for the VSM tool industry</h1>
			<p>My ultimate <a id="_idIndexMarker2147"/>vision for VSM is that the traditional VSM initiatives and modern VSM tool-oriented concepts come together. In fact, I think this could be a tremendous boon for the VSM tool industry. Instead of limiting their use to improve DevOps-based software delivery value streams, we could use the same integration, automation, and orchestration capabilities across all organizational value streams.</p>
			<p>For example, how hard would it be to extend the VSM tools vision – which currently supports data capture and the normalization of data across software delivery pipeline activities, to also provide the same kind of end-to-end visibility and analysis across all value stream flows? Such a strategy would mean the VSM tool vendors create extensions to help their customers develop applications and integrations to monitor and capture data across other types of development and operational value streams and their activities. </p>
			<p>Most manufacturing companies already employ commercial and custom software applications to control production flows. Process control systems are particularly important in highly integrated, automated, and high-volume production environments. </p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Section 2</em>, <em class="italic">VSM Methodology</em>, I questioned the need to have separate VSM methods for IT, conducted differently than the VSM initiatives supporting other development and operational value streams. I similarly question if we need a different set of tools for <a id="_idIndexMarker2148"/>data capture, normalization, and analytics across disparate value streams. We need to apply VSM concepts and tool capabilities across all organizational value streams in our digital economy. The aggregation of tools will enable seamless and real-time access to data and provide end-to-end visibility and analytics from concept to value delivery/cash.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-416"><a id="_idTextAnchor510"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this final chapter, you have learned how to unite the work of traditional VSM initiatives with the improvements made through DevOps-based VSM initiatives and tools to improve an organization's competitive posture in our modern digital world. While many VSM tool vendors make it appear that their VSM tools provide end-to-end visibility across all value streams, the reality is they are focused on IT-oriented value streams. That's not a bad thing because DevOps pipelines are complex and expensive, and time-consuming to build on an enterprise scale.</p>
			<p>But you've also learned that improvements in any value stream in isolation of understanding their impact on the system as a whole are forms of local optimization. That means we can spend a lot of time and money on maturing our DevOps-based software delivery capabilities and not move the needle to help the organization improve its overall value-delivery capabilities and bottom line.</p>
			<p>We must align our improved software delivery capabilities to support the needs across the organization's value streams. That is where much greater ROI lies. In fact, if that alignment does not occur, it's doubtful the IT organization will obtain executive-level support to sustain the initiative on a large scale across the enterprise. So, in this chapter, you learned that you must align VSM and DevOps tool investments with corporate strategies through the portfolio management process. And you must also align your improved DevOps pipelines to support the identified digital improvement opportunities across the organization's other value streams and their VSM initiatives. </p>
