				<li>Digitally enhanced technologies now allow organizations to conduct business on the internet, and via mobile technologies, while providing near-real-time global access to information and knowledge-based services. Plus, products communicate and obtain updates via the <strong class="bold">Internet of Things</strong> (<strong class="bold">IoT</strong>).</li>
				<li>The problem is that humans have an annoying habit of using the same terms among themselves, but thinking about the meanings of the words in very different ways. Different semantic meanings of terms make human-to-human and human-to-computer communications very challenging.</li>
				<li>The combination of resulting experiences (including price) that an organization delivers to a group of intended customers in a given time frame, in return for those customers buying/using or otherwise doing what the organization wants instead of taking some competing alternative.</li>
				<li>Everybody.</li>
				<li>Because, in a competitive market, you will be quickly beaten by your competitors who are paying attention to the market and providing better customer-centric value for money.</li>
				<li>Value streams are end-to-end collections of activities that create a result for a customer.</li>
				<li>Features and functions are the instantiations of functional and non-functional requirements, while value streams are the activities that enable such deliveries.</li>
				<li>VSM implements methods and tools that help organizations increase the value they deliver to customers by optimizing workflow across their IT value streams.</li>
				<li>a. Strategy to portfolio – Drive an IT portfolio to business innovation.<p>b. Requirement to deploy – Build what the business needs when it needs it.</p><p>c. Request to fulfill – Catalog, fulfill, and manage service usage.</p><p>d. Detect to correct – Anticipate and resolve production issues.</p></li>

				<li>We can accelerate value delivery by implementing streamlining, integration, and automation strategies.</li>
				<li>a. Waiting – Delays in processing, including any time products spend waiting or in a queue <p>b. Overproduction – Producing more of something than you need, or more than your customers currently want</p><p>c. Extra-processing – Over-processing or conducting any non-value-added activity</p><p>d. Transportation – Wasted time, resources, and costs from moving products and materials from one location to another</p><p>e. Motion – Unnecessary movement, or activities by people</p><p>f. Inventory – Carrying and storing any materials and products not undergoing a value-added activity</p><p>g. Defects – Faults in the products or services produced</p></li>
				<li>Agile methodologies often employ <strong class="bold">iterative and incremental development (IID)</strong> philosophies. Though minimal, the IID approach is still a form of batch processing. In contrast, Lean seeks to implement continuous flows, ideally as single-piece flows.</li>

			<ol>
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Value Stream Management </strong>(<strong class="bold">VSM</strong>) is fundamentally about implementing Lean concepts within an organization and making the Lean development and delivery processes a way of life.</li>
				<li>Materials and information flow mapping. The significance is that the identification and management of information flows are every bit as important as material flows across a Lean value stream.</li>
				<li>Lean value always flows downstream towards the customer, and any preceding activity is upstream.  </li>
				<li><a id="_idTextAnchor520"/>The same concept applies across each value stream. The activities furthest from the customer are always considered upstream from those that are performed closest to the customer.</li>
				<li>True. Value streams include all value-creating and non-value-creating that an organization includes when bringing a product from concept to launch.</li>
				<li>"An end-to-end collection of activities that creates a result for a 'customer,' who may be the ultimate customer or an internal 'end-user' of the value stream."</li>
				<li>Development value stream – All of the actions, both value-creating and non-value-creating, required to bring a product from conception to launch. </li>
				<li>Operational value streams – All activities from order to delivery.</li>
				<li>Value streams include the activities required to process information from the customer, and actions to transform the product on its way to the customer.</li>
				<li>They are:<p>i. Commit to Lean </p><p>ii. Choose value stream</p><p>iii. Learn about Lean</p><p>iv. Map current state</p><p>v. Identify Lean metrics</p><p>vi. Map future state	</p><p>vii. Map future state – customer demand</p><p>viii. Map future state – continuous flow</p><p>ix. Map future state – leveling</p><p>x. Create Kaizen (continuous improvement) plans</p><p>xi. Implement Kaizen plans.</p></li>
				<li>Communications, management, setting up the proper starting conditions, sustainment, and tools.</li>
				<li>The Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule and the Pareto law) is a natural phenomenon that states that roughly 20% of the elements have 80% of the impact in any system. In the context of your VSM initiative, some value stream improvements will be more critical to the organization's immediate success than others. To make this kind of assessment, the VSM team needs to gather critical Lean-oriented metrics in production rates and waste across all value stream activities. </li>
				<li>Identify and then name the value stream with the first and last activities. For example, common development-oriented value streams include Concept to launch, Raw material to finish product, and Order to cash.</li>

			<ol>
				<li value="1">DevOps began as a collaboration strategy in the context of Agile Systems Administration. The initial goal was to improve communications and collaborations between development and operations teams within an IT organization. Ultimately, CI/CD pipelines address the issues of mismatched velocities between development and operations teams.</li>
				<li>Configuration Management, Task Management/Automation, Containerization</li>
				<li>CI enforces a discipline of merging all developers' working copies of their code to a shared repository several times a day.  <p>The purpose is to verify each incremental code integration's functionality through software build and test processes as and when the code is developed.  </p><p>The goal is to ensure the main software code is always working and in a potentially deployable state. </p></li>
				<li>Software developers thrive in a world of change, delivering new features and capabilities continuously. That's a good thing because customers and users want new features that add value. Systems administrators don't care for change all that much, as they are responsible for ensuring all networks, systems, and applications are running, stable, and secure. And that's a good thing too, as we need our networks and software to work and be secure.</li>
				<li>Continuous delivery capabilities allow product teams to stand up to new environments and rapidly test new code updates with minimal, if any, manual labor.  </li>
				<li>CD's primary goal is to turn new updates into routine and high-velocity tasks that a development team can perform on-demand.</li>
				<li>IaC allows developers to use a programming or scripting language to generate repeatable code or scripted instructions to provide IT infrastructure. Installed on a shared repository, IaC allows developers to stand up new servers on demand via a self-service model. </li>
				<li>The purpose of CaC is to facilitate the versioned migration of application configurations between different environments.</li>
				<li>The term "toolchain" specifies a scope of tools that support IT value stream activities. But the term "toolchain" by itself does not necessarily imply an integration or automation strategy.</li>
				<li>The word "pipeline" connotes a flow. In the case of Lean-oriented production philosophies, we want streamlined and efficient flows of both work and information across our IT value streams.</li>
				<li>SDLC and ITSM value streams, or CI/CD and ITSM value streams.</li>
				<li>ITSM focuses on how IT teams deliver services. In contrast, ITOM focuses on the activities and tools used for event management, performance monitoring, and the operations processes depicted in the DevOps pipeline's Ops portion (<em class="italic">Figure 5.7</em>).</li>
				<li>Project-based funding builds on projected future returns on investments.</li>
				<li>Product-based funding models evaluate current costs and revenues to assess how much money to invest in development and operations support.</li>

			<ol>
				<li value="1">Implementing Lean concepts within an organization and making Lean development and delivery processes a way of life.</li>
				<li>Lean companies are more competitive than others because they continuously improve their business operations. Lean enterprises are more employee-friendly because they have respect for their work, and delegate responsibilities to the people doing the work. They also help to minimize the bureaucracy and hierarchical organizational structures that get in the way of productivity and ultimately cause employee stress and burnout. </li>

			<ol>
				<li value="1">Without a current state value stream map, you may not be aware of the system-wide impacts associated with your current value stream activities. </li>
				<li>We need to document our existing activity flows, order entry system, production control system, cycle times, equipment setup, and product changeover times, as well as our lot and batch sizes, quality levels, defects, and unsynchronized material and information flows.</li>
				<li>Value stream mapping helps identify and eliminate waste that hinders productivity.<p>Business process models are often used to support business process reengineering and improvement activities. They also serve to create business systems that automate those improvements.</p></li>
				<li>We need to know the business process is efficient and value-adding, as automating a flawed process only exacerbates its inefficiencies with the rapid accumulation of non-value-added costs.</li>
				<li>No, it's time to get to work. Just do it!</li>
				<li>Without standards, communication and understanding quickly deteriorate among VSM team members and other stakeholders who review the maps.</li>
				<li>The Gemba and current state mapping activities provide insights into the waste areas that hinder material and information flows. </li>

				<li>Start your current state mapping exercise from final customer deliveries and work your way upstream (backward) through the various processes. </li>
				<li>It keeps the focus on the needs of the customer. It orients our minds to think in terms of pull-based flows. Moreover, we can better work our way through complex flows in production environments by having multiple assembly branches. </li>
				<li>The VSM team must prioritize improvements in terms of the highest value impacts.</li>
				<li>They are:<p>Draw customers and suppliers.</p><p>Draw the entry and exit activities.</p><p>Draw all activities between entry and exit processes.</p><p>List all activity attributes.</p><p>Draw queue and waiting times between activities.</p><p>Draw all communications that occur within the value stream.</p><p>Draw push or pull icons to identify the type of workflow.</p><p>Document all other collected data.</p></li>

			<ol>
				<li value="1">It's difficult to improve things without measures of the current state and desired future states.</li>
				<li>CT is the timespan between starting and finishing a value stream activity. CT does not include <strong class="bold">work in progress </strong>(<strong class="bold">WIP</strong>) waiting times between value stream activities in this measure. </li>

				<li>To analyze customer demands for your organization's products or services to include quality objectives and lead time.</li>
				<li>To improve flows so that our customers receive the right products or services, at the right time, and with the right features in the correct quantities.</li>
				<li>To distribute work evenly across product lines, reduce waiting times, and eliminate batch processing (also known as working toward achieving single-piece flows).</li>
				<li>Calculate Takt time by dividing net available operating time by the number of products required over time. Takt time is a measure of how often the value stream needs to deliver its products or service in order to meet customer demands. For example, a Takt time of 0.5 of a minute means the value stream must produce a new item every 30 seconds to keep up with customer demand.</li>
				<li>Pitch equals the Takt time multiplied by the pack-out quantity. Pitch is the amount of time needed for a value stream to make one container of products.</li>
				<li>Eliminating <strong class="bold">work in progress</strong> (<strong class="bold">WIP</strong>) leads to waste in the form of queues and waiting.</li>
				<li>To produce and move one work item at a time, or at least the smallest practical number of items, through a series of value stream activities in as continuous a fashion as possible.</li>
				<li>The objective of production leveling is to produce the same number of items consistently at exactly the Takt time rate.</li>
				<li>Agile development teams aggregate selected work items from the Product backlog into Sprint backlogs, and then work those items as a single lot, from start to finish, across an iterative sprint duration (typically 1 to 4 weeks).<p>Kanban boards employed with a traditional Agile or Scrum-based Sprint help the development team visualize and manage WIP. The Kanban boards implement a pull-oriented production control strategy from within the sprint backlog and across each sprint.</p><p>CI/CD and DevOps pipeline capabilities allow the Agile teams to pull work items directly from the product backlog and work them as single-piece flows across the IT value stream. </p></li>

			<ol>
				<li value="1">James P. Womack, Ph.D. James Womack and his colleague, Daniel T. Jones, coined the term Value Stream in an article published in the Harvard Business Review magazine, titled "From Lean Production to the Lean Enterprise" (March–April 1994).</li>
				<li>LeanFITT's founders were the original thought leaders in the early development of value stream management concepts and methodologies.</li>
				<li>The issue is that those managers and executives have multiple value streams running through their functional departments, but the metrics and financial incentives drive department or facility-level improvements.</li>
				<li>All of the actions, both value-creating and non-value-creating, are required to bring a product from concept to launch (also known as the development value stream) and from order to delivery (also known as the operational value stream). These include actions to process information from the customer and actions to transform the product on its way to the customer.</li>
				<li>Lean Action Plans help reduce resistance, spread the right learning objectives, and engender the type of commitment necessary for a Lean enterprise.</li>
				<li>The LeanFITT system offers methods, tools, and techniques to improve organizational processes, people, and profits.</li>
				<li>The phases are:<ol><li>Getting people trained and engaged.</li><li>Standardizing the improvement process.</li><li>Energizing the team with active involvement and transparency.</li><li>Making lean routine and sustainable.</li></ol></li>
				<li>The means and methods to <em class="italic">tell the continuous improvement story</em> logically and visually.</li>
				<li>An informative measure of quality, a six sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to produce some feature or part are statistically expected to be free of defects.</li>
				<li>Lean tools and quality tools</li>

				<li value="1">"Instill the mindset that DevOps is a cultural movement for the whole organization and design value stream teams that practice DevOps."</li>
				<li>Solution delivery, DevSecOps, data DevOps, Multi solutions support, Common IT operations, and business operations.</li>
				<li>Chief or line of business executives support the funding of the initiatives, allocate sufficient resources, and hold people responsible for achieving identifiable and measurable outcomes with timeframes, budgets, and ROIs that justify the effort.</li>
				<li>How their IT managers and executives are tired of spending money on IT without showing value across the rest of the organization.</li>
				<li>In CI/CD and DevOps pipelines, we can automate the deployment of new releases through configurations implemented as code in the form of <strong class="bold">Infrastructure as Code</strong> (<strong class="bold">IaC</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Configuration as Code</strong> (<strong class="bold">CaC</strong>).</li>
				<li>Building a custom DevOps platform, purchasing a cloud-based DevOps-as-a-Service (DaaS) solution offering, employing VSM tools to integrate and orchestrate your DevOps toolchains, and building software factories through the construction of self-service configurations as code, downloadable via GIT or another SCM tool.</li>
				<li>Purchase a license to use commercial <strong class="bold">DevSecOps as a service </strong>(<strong class="bold">DaaS</strong>). </li>
				<li>Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, and Sharing.</li>
				<li>Building a dedicated DevOps team from scratch is only going to create new silos operating across your horizontal value stream.</li>
				<li>The organization's chief and line of business executives. They must keep the momentum going through the hard times.</li>

				<li value="1">To transform businesses into viable entities to compete in our digital economy.</li>
				<li>False. Outside of IT, where these concepts are relatively new, manufacturing and other industries have practiced Lean and VSM for decades. </li>
				<li>Toyota sought to improve quality and efficiencies in an island nation, coming out of the Great Depression and World War II, when access to resources was limited and expensive. Toyota's approach to be competitive in its global markets was to build higher-quality products with less wasting of resources, while simultaneously ensuring they built only the products customers wanted when they wanted them.</li>
				<li>Agile began as a set of values and principles to support the needs of small software development teams to become more responsive and adaptable. In the process, Agile evolved to implement iterative and incremental development practices that leveraged prototyping and empiricism to quickly create working solutions with customer-directed inputs.</li>
				<li>Identify, Organize, and Map</li>
				<li>Connect</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Agile</strong> – measured in 1 to 4 weeks and limited to the budgets and authorities granted to the development team.<p><strong class="bold">Lean</strong> – Often view changes across multiple planning horizons that may span several fiscal years, and involve changes and budgets requiring executive-level sponsorship and commitment authority.</p></li>
				<li>Local optimization. <p>Because we can expend much time, effort, and money on the initiatives but necessarily impact the value delivery capabilities of the organization as a whole.</p></li>
				<li>The primary purpose of portfolio management is to centralize and control the budgeting and investments process so that organizations can evaluate all improvement opportunities and their priorities in context with corporate strategies.<p>VSM and DevOps tool investments compete against all the other potential investments under evaluation by the organization at large.</p></li>
				<li>Because new management comes in and cannot easily see the mechanism that supports horizontal value deliveries. They are more comfortable managing the vertical silos of traditional hierarchical business structures.</li>
