- en: Monitoring software applications used to be an afterthought â€“ when an outage
    happened, a check was put in place to monitor the functionality of the software
    or the status of part of the infrastructure where the software system ran. It
    had never been comprehensive, and the monitoring infrastructure grew organically.
    The first-generation monitoring tools were only designed to meet such a simple,
    reactive approach to rolling out monitoring.

- en: The widespread use of the public cloud as a computing platform, the ongoing
    trend of deploying applications as microservices, and the delivery of **Software
    as a Service** (**SaaS**) with *24x7* availability made the operating of software
    systems far more complex than it used to be. Proactive monitoring became an essential
    part of DevOps culture as rolling out monitoring iteratively and incrementally
    is not an option anymore as the users expect the software systems to always be
    available. Software systems are now designed with observability in mind so that
    their workings can be exposed and monitored well. Both system and application
    logs are aggregated and analyzed for operational insights.

- en: There is a large repository of monitoring applications now available to meet
    these new monitoring requirements both as on-premises and SaaS-based solutions.
    Some tools focus on a specific area of monitoring and others try to cater to all
    types of monitoring. It is common to use three or four different monitoring applications
    to cover all aspects of monitoring. Datadog, a SaaS monitoring solution, is emerging
    as a monitoring platform that can be used to build a comprehensive monitoring
    infrastructure in an enterprise. This book aims to introduce Datadog to a variety
    of audiences and help you to roll out Datadog as a proactive monitoring solution.

- en: This book is for DevOps engineers, **site reliability engineers** (**SREs**),
    IT production engineers, and system administrators who need to understand the
    features offered by Datadog as a comprehensive SaaS monitoring platform for them
    to roll out those features and integrate Datadog with other applications. The
    book would be helpful to software developers also for them to understand how a
    modern monitoring tool works and to fine-tune their applications accordingly.

    to anyone who is interested in learning more about the monitoring of software
    applications. However, the following background would better prepare you to understand
    the content of this book and take advantage of the examples provided in the book
