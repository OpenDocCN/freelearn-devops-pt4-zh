			<h1 id="_idParaDest-71"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Chapter 3</em>: The Datadog Dashboard</h1>
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>In the previous chapter, we looked at the various ways the Datadog agents running on your infrastructure upload monitoring metrics to Datadog's SaaS backend. The Datadog dashboard provides an excellent view of that data, and it can be accessed using popular web browsers. The administrators use the dashboard to perform a variety of tasks – managing user accounts and their privileges, creating operational dashboards, enabling integrations, and creating monitors are typical examples. The dashboard provides a chat window for the users to contact customer support as well. </p>
			<p>While the dashboard has a large number of features, some of them are more important than others, and we will study them in detail in this chapter. These are the important dashboard features:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Infrastructure List </li>
				<li>Events</li>
				<li>Metrics Explorer</li>
				<li>Dashboards</li>
				<li>Integrations</li>
				<li>Monitors</li>
				<li>Advanced features</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>Technical requirements </h1>
			<p>To try out the examples mentioned in this book, you need to have the following tools and resources:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An Ubuntu 18.04 environment with Bash shell. The examples might work on other Linux distributions as well, but suitable changes must be done to the Ubuntu specific commands.</li>
				<li>A Datadog account and a user with admin-level access.</li>
				<li>A Datadog Agent running at host level or as a microservice depending on the example, pointing to the Datadog account.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>Infrastructure List </h1>
			<p>Once an <a id="_idIndexMarker224"/>agent is up and running on a host, the agent starts reporting into the Datadog backend in the cloud. The host will get added to the infrastructure lists once communication between the agent running on it and the backend is successfully established.</p>
			<p>The infrastructure lists are available underneath the <strong class="bold">Infrastructure</strong> main menu. The most important ones are <strong class="bold">Host Map</strong> and <strong class="bold">Infrastructure List</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer027" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.1_B16483.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1 – Infrastructure menu options&#13;&#10;" width="317" height="440"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.1 – Infrastructure menu options</p>
			<p>Each block in a <strong class="bold">Host Map</strong> menu represents a host where an agent is running. In the following screenshot, the green color indicates that the agent is active and able to communicate with the <a id="_idIndexMarker225"/>backend. The orange color indicates some trouble with communication; however, it also indicates that, at some point in the past, the related agent was able to connect to the backend:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer028" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.2_B16483.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 – An example the host map&#13;&#10;" width="964" height="495"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.2 – An example the host map</p>
			<p>By clicking on a specific block, you can view monitoring details on the related host such as the hostname, the tags defined at the host level, various system-level information, and the list of services being monitored, as shown in the following screenshot: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer029" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.3_B16483.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3 – The host details from Host Map&#13;&#10;" width="1200" height="709"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.3 – The host details from Host Map</p>
			<p>This host-level<a id="_idIndexMarker226"/> drill-down feature to look up various system information avoids the need to log in to a host to check on such details.</p>
			<p>As indicated in the following screenshot, there are links available on this interface to take you to various host-specific dashboards. For example, the <strong class="bold">Dashboard</strong> link will open a dashboard where you can view various infrastructure metrics such as CPU usage, load averages, and disk usage. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Infrastructure List</strong> offers a tabular view of the hosts, as shown in the following screenshot: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer030" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.04_B16483.jpg" alt="Figure 3.4 – Example Infrastructure List &#13;&#10;" width="1650" height="615"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.4 – Example Infrastructure List </p>
			<p>This interface <a id="_idIndexMarker227"/>is another view of the host list and not very different from <strong class="bold">Host Map</strong> in terms of the monitoring information it provides on a specific host. </p>
			<p>You can view more options, such as <strong class="bold">Containers</strong> and <strong class="bold">Processes</strong>, underneath the <strong class="bold">Infrastructure</strong> menu. As the names indicate, the related runtime resources can be listed and searched for in the respective dashboards.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Events</h1>
			<p>Most monitoring tools <a id="_idIndexMarker228"/>only focus on collecting and reporting time-series metrics data. In comparison, Datadog reports on events too, and that is one of its attractive features. These are system-level events such as the restarting of a Datadog agent and the deployment of a new container:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer031" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.5_B16483.jpg" alt="Figure 3.5 – An example events dashboard&#13;&#10;" width="1197" height="526"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.5 – An example events dashboard</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Events</strong> dashboard can be accessed using the <strong class="bold">Events</strong> main menu option on the Datadog UI. You can directly add an update to the events stream using this dashboard and also comment on an already posted event. This social media-inspired feature is useful in situations <a id="_idIndexMarker229"/>where you need to communicate or add clarity about some system maintenance-generated events to remote teams.</p>
			<p>The events listed on the dashboard can be filtered using various options, including <strong class="bold">search</strong>. Additionally, there is an option to aggregate related events, which is useful in adding brevity to the events listing. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Events</strong> is one of the main menu options, and using it, the dashboard can be accessed.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>Metrics Explorer</h1>
			<p>The metrics collected by Datadog can<a id="_idIndexMarker230"/> be viewed and searched for from the <strong class="bold">Metrics Explorer</strong> dashboard, which can be accessed from the main <strong class="bold">Metrics</strong> menu:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer032" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.6_B16483.jpg" alt="Figure 3.6 – The Metrics menu options&#13;&#10;" width="972" height="812"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.6 – The Metrics menu options</p>
			<p>Soon after the agent <a id="_idIndexMarker231"/>running on a host is connected to the Datadog backend, you can begin looking at a variety of metrics that monitor the infrastructure. This feature is out of the box, and there is no special configuration required:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer033" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.7_B16483.jpg" alt="Figure 3.7 – Looking up free memory on a host using Metrics Explorer&#13;&#10;" width="1139" height="560"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.7 – Looking up free memory on a host using Metrics Explorer</p>
			<p>The infrastructure <a id="_idIndexMarker232"/>metric names are prefixed with <strong class="bold">system</strong>, and a full list of the metrics that are available out of the box can be found in the Datadog documentation.</p>
			<p>In the <strong class="bold">Metrics Explorer</strong> dashboard, the metrics name is specified in the <strong class="bold">Graph</strong> field. There is an automatic search feature that pulls possible metric names based on what text string you type in. Multiple metrics can be specified in this field.</p>
			<p>In the <strong class="bold">Over</strong> field, various tags can be specified to narrow down the scope when searching for a metric. We will learn more about tags in <a href="B16483_05_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor178"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Custom Metrics and Tags</em>. Out of the box, very few tags are available, such as <strong class="source-inline">host</strong>, which points to the hostname. With very little effort, for instance, by adding a <strong class="source-inline">tags</strong> entry in the Datadog agent configuration file, tags can be added to the metric.</p>
			<p>As a Datadog user, you will use <strong class="bold">Metrics Explorer</strong> on a regular basis for the following reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Looking up the metrics' time-series data pertaining to a specific infrastructure resource or application.</li>
				<li>In addition to looking up the metrics data, creating graphs for the related data to add custom dashboards.</li>
				<li>Triaging issues pertain to publishing custom metrics and tags . If such customizations work, it will be easy to query the custom metrics and tags using this dashboard and verify their availability<a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Dashboards</h1>
			<p>A Datadog dashboard is a<a id="_idIndexMarker233"/> visual tool that can be used to track and analyze metrics. It offers a rich set of features that can be used to build custom dashboards, in addition to the dashboards available out of the box.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Dashboards</strong> main menu option has two options, <strong class="bold">Dashboard List</strong> and <strong class="bold">New Dashboard</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer034" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.8_B16483.jpg" alt="Figure 3.8 – The Dashboards main menu options&#13;&#10;" width="601" height="385"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.8 – The Dashboards main menu options</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Dashboard List</strong> menu will list all the dashboards grouped by various categories.</p>
			<p>Two types of custom dashboards can be created in Datadog, <strong class="bold">Timeboards</strong> and <strong class="bold">Screenboards</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer035" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.9_B16483.jpg" alt="Figure 3.9 – Datadog dashboard types&#13;&#10;" width="462" height="258"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.9 – Datadog dashboard types</p>
			<p>The graphs in a <strong class="bold">Timeboard</strong> dashboard will share the same time frame, so it will be useful for comparing multiple metrics side by side. This feature makes a <strong class="bold">Timeboard</strong> dashboard useful for triaging issues. The <strong class="bold">Screenboard</strong> dashboard doesn't have a time constraint, and <a id="_idIndexMarker234"/>disparate objects can be assembled on it. In that sense, a <strong class="bold">Screenboard</strong> type dashboard is more suitable for building a traditional monitoring dashboard. </p>
			<p>Now, let's look at how a <strong class="bold">Timeboard</strong> type dashboard is created to explain the dashboard creation process.</p>
			<p>The first step is to set the name and type of the dashboard, as shown in the previous screenshot. </p>
			<p>In the next step, you should see the <strong class="bold">Add graph</strong> option. By clicking on it, you will get the option to add different types of widgets, as shown in the following screenshot: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer036" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.10_B16483.jpg" alt="Figure 3.10 – Dashboard widgets for the Screenboard type dashboard&#13;&#10;" width="1060" height="405"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.10 – Dashboard widgets for the Screenboard type dashboard</p>
			<p>The widget that you require for the <a id="_idIndexMarker235"/>dashboard can be dragged down from the preceding list and placed on the dashboard area below. For our example dashboard, let's use a <strong class="bold">Timeseries</strong> widget that will be useful to build dashboards with time-series metrics.</p>
			<p>In the sample dashboard, two graphs are added for the <strong class="source-inline">system.cpu.user</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">system.disk.free</strong> metrics for a specific host.</p>
			<p>There are several options available to narrow down the features you want to implement for a graph. In the graph shown in the following screenshot, any available metric can be picked to plot the graph, and the scope can be filtered using the choices available in the <strong class="bold">Graph your data</strong> | <strong class="bold">from</strong> dropdown. In this example, the <strong class="bold">system.cpu.user</strong> metric has been selected and that has been filtered down to a single <strong class="bold">i-021b5a51fbdfe237b</strong> host:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer037" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.11_B16483.jpg" alt="Figure 3.11 – Configuring the graph for the dashboard&#13;&#10;" width="1073" height="541"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.11 – Configuring the graph for the dashboard</p>
			<p>As mentioned earlier, there <a id="_idIndexMarker236"/>are several options available to create the dashboard widgets. This is an area you need to master by practice if setting up monitoring dashboards is an important requirement in your organization and documentation is available for every possible option.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows two graphs on the sample dashboard. Likewise, you can create more graphs to make it a complete dashboard for a specific use. In this scenario, time-series graphs of the <strong class="source-inline">system.cpu.user</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">system.disk.free</strong> system metrics are displayed on the dashboard:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer038" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.12_B16483.jpg" alt="Figure 3.12 – Graphs on the Sample dashboard&#13;&#10;" width="1059" height="604"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.12 – Graphs on the Sample dashboard</p>
			<p>Each such graph can be shared and <a id="_idIndexMarker237"/>embedded outside of the Datadog UI using the <strong class="bold">Graph your data</strong> | <strong class="bold">Share</strong> option, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.11</em>. By clicking on it, you will get the sharing options shown in the following screenshot: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer039" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.13_B16483.jpg" alt="Figure 3.13 – Sharing a graph&#13;&#10;" width="577" height="476"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.13 – Sharing a graph</p>
			<p>The configuration options available for sharing a graph are self-explanatory. Essentially, it will generate a<a id="_idIndexMarker238"/> JSON code snippet that can be used to embed the graph on a web page<a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>The main Integrations menu</h1>
			<p>The options listed<a id="_idIndexMarker239"/> underneath the <strong class="bold">Integrations</strong> main menu option are important, and you will be using them often:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer040" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.14_B16483.jpg" alt="Figure 3.14 – The Integrations main menu options&#13;&#10;" width="1070" height="704"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.14 – The Integrations main menu options</p>
			<p>Now, let's take a look at the options available under the main menu item, <strong class="bold">Integrations</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>Integrations</h2>
			<p>As shown in the<a id="_idIndexMarker240"/> following screenshot, underneath this tab, the Datadog integrations with third-party tools are available out of the box and can be viewed and searched for: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer041" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.15_B16483.jpg" alt="Figure 3.15 – NGINX integration&#13;&#10;" width="405" height="307"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.15 – NGINX integration</p>
			<p>As an example, the <a id="_idIndexMarker241"/>NGINX integration shown in the preceding screenshot can be installed from the dashboard. This only enables the integration of your account inside the Datadog backend. Usually, there will be additional steps that need to be completed on the infrastructure side, and those steps will be provided in the dashboard, as shown in the following screenshot: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer042" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.16_B16483.jpg" alt="Figure 3.16 – NGINX Integration – Configuration&#13;&#10;" width="1036" height="546"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.16 – NGINX Integration – Configuration</p>
			<p>Additionally, this interface provides a list of metrics that will be available through this integration. The following screenshot shows the metrics that will be published by the NGINX integration:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer043" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.17_B16483.jpg" alt="Figure 3.17 – NGINX Integration – Metrics&#13;&#10;" width="809" height="577"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.17 – NGINX Integration – Metrics</p>
			<p>On the hosts<a id="_idIndexMarker242"/> where NGINX runs, the steps to enable the integration on the infrastructure side can be executed. Once all the integration setup requirements are completed, the preceding set of metrics that are specific to NGINX will be available from each one of those machines, and the metrics can be used to build dashboards and monitors.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-79"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>APIs</h2>
			<p>Underneath the <strong class="bold">APIs</strong> tab on the <strong class="bold">Integrations</strong> dashboard, you can find all of the resources you need to<a id="_idIndexMarker243"/> integrate your application with Datadog. Datadog provides APIs and gateways to interact with its backend programmatically, and a matured monitoring system will leverage such options to integrate with Datadog in order to add custom metrics and features that might not be available out of the box:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer044" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.18_B16483.jpg" alt="Figure 3.18 – Integration access resources&#13;&#10;" width="1019" height="497"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.18 – Integration access resources</p>
			<p>Here are the main resources that can be used to<a id="_idIndexMarker244"/> gain access to the Datadog backend, programmatically, as a client:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">API Keys</strong>: As you might have seen<a id="_idIndexMarker245"/> in the previous chapter, <em class="italic">Datadog Agent</em>, the API key is the information that correlates an agent with your account, and it is a mandatory configuration item that needs to be set in the Datadog agent configuration file.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Application Keys</strong>: A script or an <a id="_idIndexMarker246"/>application needs to authenticate with the Datadog backend before it can start executing APIs to do something, such as publishing an event or a metric. For authentication, an API key-application key pair is needed, and that can be generated using the dashboard.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Events API Emails</strong>: This is an email<a id="_idIndexMarker247"/> gateway in which events can be published to your account and posted on the <strong class="bold">Events</strong> dashboard.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Client Token</strong>: A client token is used to<a id="_idIndexMarker248"/> publish events and ship logs from a web or mobile application <a id="_idIndexMarker249"/>running inside a <strong class="bold">Real User Monitoring</strong> (<strong class="bold">RUM</strong>) setup.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor153"/>Agent</h2>
			<p>Underneath the <strong class="bold">Agent</strong> tab, you can find all the<a id="_idIndexMarker250"/> information needed to install a Datadog agent for a target platform. Usually, a command line to install the agent is available on this page.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-81"><a id="_idTextAnchor154"/>Embeds</h2>
			<p>We have learned how a <a id="_idIndexMarker251"/>new dashboard can be created and shared in the <em class="italic">Dashboards</em> section. The dashboard can be embedded on a web page using the related JSON code. Using this option, the shared dashboards can be listed as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer045" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.19_B16483.jpg" alt="Figure 3.19 – The Embeds option in the Integrations menu&#13;&#10;" width="829" height="308"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.19 – The Embeds option in the Integrations menu</p>
			<p>Additionally, the sharing option can be revoked from any dashboard using the <strong class="bold">Revoke</strong> button, as shown in the preceding screenshot.</p>
			<p>We have looked at various menu options related to integration. Let's explore what options are available for monitors in the next s<a id="_idTextAnchor155"/>ection. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor156"/>Monitors</h1>
			<p>We already discussed the basic concepts of monitors in <a href="B16483_01_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introduction to Monitoring</em>. Datadog provides an<a id="_idIndexMarker252"/> advanced implementation of monitors with a variety of features. The monitors can be created and maintained from the dashboard manually. The following screenshot provides a list of options available under this menu item:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer046" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.20_B16483.jpg" alt="Figure 3.20 – The Monitors main menu options&#13;&#10;" width="1045" height="571"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.20 – The Monitors main menu options</p>
			<p>We will discuss monitors, in more detail, in <a href="B16483_08_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor248"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Monitors and Alerts</em>. Here, we will briefly look at the important menu<a id="_idIndexMarker253"/> options that are available:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Manage Monitors</strong>: Under this tab, all the available monitors are listed, and monitors can be selected from that list for update. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Triggered Monitors</strong>: Essentially, thresholds are set on a metric to define a monitor, and they trigger when the threshold values are reached. Under this menu, a list of these triggered events is listed. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">New Monitor</strong>: A new monitor can be created manually by following the workflow provided here. Although a monitor is usually tied to a metric, Datadog provides a variety of monitors. We will discuss this, in more detail, in <a href="B16483_08_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor248"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Monitors and Alerts</em>. However, in the next section, we will learn how a simple monitor can be set up to help you to gain an understanding of the basics.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Manage Downtime</strong>: During a downtime window, a monitor will not trigger even if it hits a threshold. The classic use of downtime is to silence the monitors during some maintenance or deployment activity. Under this tab, downtimes can be scheduled.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor157"/>Creating a new metric monitor</h2>
			<p>In Datadog, you can set up a variety of<a id="_idIndexMarker254"/> monitors, and we will go over all of them in <a href="B16483_08_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor248"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Monitors and Alerts</em>. Here, we will learn how a metric-based monitor, which is the most common of all the monitors, can be created.</p>
			<p>Select <strong class="bold">Monitors</strong> | <strong class="bold">New Monitor</strong> from the Datadog UI. Pick <strong class="bold">Metric</strong> as the <strong class="bold">Select a monitor type</strong> option. You will get a form to configure the new monitor, as shown in the following screenshot (note that the form is not provided in full):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer047" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.21 – Configuring a new monitor</p>
			<p>Essentially, the sample monitor tracks free disk space available on the <strong class="source-inline">/dev/xvda1</strong> storage device, which is the root partition of the <strong class="source-inline">i-021b5a51fbdfe237b</strong> host. It will send out a warning message when the free disk space reaches 1 GB and a critical message when the amount of free space available falls to 0.5 GB. These alerts are configured to be sent to an email address.</p>
			<p>To accomplish this, perform the following steps: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Select <strong class="bold">Threshold Alert</strong> under <strong class="bold">Choose the detection method</strong>. </li>
				<li>Under <strong class="bold">Define the metric</strong>, select <strong class="bold">system.disk.free</strong> as the metric and select the required host and device in the <strong class="bold">from</strong> field. </li>
				<li>Under <strong class="bold">Set alert conditions</strong>, both <strong class="bold">Alert threshold</strong> and <strong class="bold">Warning threshold</strong> can be specified. Configure these thresholds to trigger alerts alerts when the metric is <strong class="bold">below</strong> the threshold values. </li>
				<li>Under <strong class="bold">Say what's happening</strong>, you can provide a template for the alert message, which will be sent out if the metric value hits any threshold. </li>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Notify your team</strong> field, the email addresses of the recipients of the alerts can be specified.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We have looked at all the common <a id="_idIndexMarker255"/>options that you can use on the Datadog UI. The interface offers many more options in which to use all of the features offered by Datadog. In the following section, we will also briefly look at the advanced features that you can access from the D<a id="_idTextAnchor158"/>atadog UI.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor159"/>Advanced features</h1>
			<p>There are a lot more menu <a id="_idIndexMarker256"/>options than the ones we have looked at, so far, in the Datadog dashboard. However, these are the core features that you will use on a regular basis, especially if you are a DevOps engineer who is responsible for maintaining the Datadog account. Let's take a look at some of them and learn what exactly each option covers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Watchdog</strong>: Watchdog is an <a id="_idIndexMarker257"/>algorithmic feature that looks at available metrics data for any irregular patterns. Monitors can be created using this option to alert you to such aberrations.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Application Performance Monitoring</strong> (<strong class="bold">APM</strong>): APM is an add-on feature that can be used if your account has a<a id="_idIndexMarker258"/> license for it. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Notebook</strong>: A notebook is a <a id="_idIndexMarker259"/>collection of text and graphs collected serially with time. It is useful for documenting issues with highly visible data in the form of graphs.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Logs</strong>: This option <a id="_idIndexMarker260"/>provides access to the add-on feature, <strong class="bold">Logs Management</strong>. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Security</strong>: The <strong class="bold">Security Monitoring</strong> option can be accessed from this menu. We will <a id="_idIndexMarker261"/>discuss this, in more detail, in <a href="B16483_14_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor426"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, <em class="italic">Miscellaneous Monitoring Topics</em>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">UX Monitoring</strong>: Synthetic tests allow <a id="_idIndexMarker262"/>you to monitor the <strong class="bold">User Experience </strong>(<strong class="bold">UX</strong>) in a <a id="_idIndexMarker263"/>simulated manner. This monitoring option allows you to monitor UX by using  different methods. We will discuss this feature in <a href="B16483_13_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor402"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Logs Using Datadog</em>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Real User Monitoring</strong>: <strong class="bold">RUM</strong> measures<a id="_idIndexMarker264"/> the actual UX directly with the help of probes embedded in the application. This is a type of last-mile monitoring that we discussed in <a href="B16483_01_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introduction to Monitoring</em>. We have looked at the important menu options available on the Datadog dashboard that are related to important Datadog features. Familiarizing yourself with these menu options is important because the dashboard is the main interface that users will use to interact with the Datadog application <a id="_idTextAnchor160"/>on a regular basis.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor161"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we looked at the Datadog dashboard menu options that are central to how users interact with the Datadog backend. A lot of features available on the dashboard, such as the creation and maintenance of monitors, can be automated. However, the dashboarding feature in Datadog is one of the best in the industry, and creating custom operational and management reporting dashboards is very easy. The features we discussed here can be used by a Datadog user, especially an administrator, on a regular basis.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will learn how to manage your Datadog account. Again, the dashboard is the main interface used by administrators for this purpose.</p>
