    on your infrastructure upload monitoring metrics to Datadog's SaaS backend. The
    Datadog dashboard provides an excellent view of that data, and it can be accessed
    using popular web browsers. The administrators use the dashboard to perform a
    variety of tasks – managing user accounts and their privileges, creating operational
    dashboards, enabling integrations, and creating monitors are typical examples.
    The dashboard provides a chat window for the users to contact customer support
    as well.

    The interface offers many more options in which to use all of the features offered
    by Datadog. In the following section, we will also briefly look at the advanced
    features that you can access from the Datadog UI.

    in the Datadog dashboard. However, these are the core features that you will use
    on a regular basis, especially if you are a DevOps engineer who is responsible
    for maintaining the Datadog account. Let''s take a look at some of them and learn
    what exactly each option covers:'

    yourself with these menu options is important because the dashboard is the main
    interface that users will use to interact with the Datadog application on a regular

- en: In this chapter, we looked at the Datadog dashboard menu options that are central
    to how users interact with the Datadog backend. A lot of features available on
    the dashboard, such as the creation and maintenance of monitors, can be automated.
    However, the dashboarding feature in Datadog is one of the best in the industry,
    and creating custom operational and management reporting dashboards is very easy.
    The features we discussed here can be used by a Datadog user, especially an administrator,
    on a regular basis.

    the dashboard is the main interface used by administrators for this purpose.
