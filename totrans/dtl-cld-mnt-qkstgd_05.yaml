    The account management features are also part of the user interface but those
    warrant a separate discussion as account management is administrative in nature
    and not all the users of Datadog would be accessing those.

- en: Datadog supports **Single Sign-On** (**SSO**) and it provides key-based API
    support. It also supports multiple organizations within a customer account that
    can be used to build isolated monitoring environments, sometimes to meet a compliance
    requirement for separating development and production accounts, or for isolating
    client accounts hosted by a SaaS provider.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a user is created, first the privileges for that user can be set by using
    default roles available out of the box or it can be done finely using custom roles
    that an administrator can set up. Within a Datadog account, multiple organizations
    can be created to group or partition the environments that need to be monitored.
    While Datadog provides a native authentication system for users to log in, it
    also supports SSO. API and application key pairs can be created for Datadog users
    and a key pair can be used to access Datadog programmatically.
