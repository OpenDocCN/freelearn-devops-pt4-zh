			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>This book provides an architectural overview of DevOps, AIOps, and DevSecOps â€“ three domains that drive and accelerate digital transformation. Complete with step-by-step explanations of essential concepts, practical examples, and self-assessment questions, you will understand why and how DevOps should be integrated into the enterprise architecture, securing it and resulting in leaner operations and accelerating digital transformation.</p>
			<p>By the end of the book, you will be able to develop robust DevOps architectures and understand which toolsets you can use. You will also have a deeper understanding of next-level DevOps implementing Site Reliability Engineering. You will have learned what AIOps is and what value it can bring to the enterprise. Lastly, you will have learned how to integrate security principles such as Zero Trust and industry security frameworks to DevOps with DevSecOps.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book teaches enterprise architects, solutions architects, and consultants how to design, implement, and integrate DevOps in the enterprise architecture while keeping operations on board with agile development and with the enterprise remaining secure and resilient. The book is not about hundreds of different tools but will teach you how to create a successful DevOps architecture.</p>
