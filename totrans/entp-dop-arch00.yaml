- en: This book provides an architectural overview of DevOps, AIOps, and DevSecOps
    â€“ three domains that drive and accelerate digital transformation. Complete with
    step-by-step explanations of essential concepts, practical examples, and self-assessment
    questions, you will understand why and how DevOps should be integrated into the
    enterprise architecture, securing it and resulting in leaner operations and accelerating
    digital transformation.

- en: By the end of the book, you will be able to develop robust DevOps architectures
    and understand which toolsets you can use. You will also have a deeper understanding
    of next-level DevOps implementing Site Reliability Engineering. You will have
    learned what AIOps is and what value it can bring to the enterprise. Lastly, you
    will have learned how to integrate security principles such as Zero Trust and
    industry security frameworks to DevOps with DevSecOps.

    cloud architecture. For enterprise architecture, an introduction to **The Open
    Group Architecture Framework** (**TOGAF**) is advised. For cloud architecture,
    a basic understanding of major public clouds such as AWS and Azure will certainly
    help you to get the most out of this book.
