- en: DevOps started—and is in some companies still done—with a lot of manual tasks,
    scripts, and ad hoc tests. A lot of enterprises focus on the applications and
    tend to forget about the platform itself—the infrastructure—but this is also crucial
    to the scaling. This chapter focuses on the scaling of DevOps, both from a technical
    and an organizational perspective.

  zh: DevOps最初—并且在一些公司中仍然是—大量依赖手动任务、脚本和临时测试。许多企业集中精力在应用程序上，往往忽视了平台本身——基础设施——而这对扩展同样至关重要。本章重点讨论从技术和组织角度扩展DevOps。
- en: After completing this chapter, you will have learned how to handle scaling.
    First, we will learn about modern DevOps, which adopts cloud and cloud-native
    technology as target platforms to run applications. Before we can do that, we
    probably need to transform the applications; otherwise, we will develop new applications.
    In DevOps, we need a development method that fits to the way of working; therefore,
    we will discuss **rapid- application development** (**RAD**). Next, we will look
    at adopting DevOps throughout a whole enterprise, starting small and then expanding.
    Finally, we will have a look at mission-critical environments and how we can manage
    them in a DevOps mode.

    their work if developers and operators were really working together as one team.
    The reason for that was easy to find, as we've already seen in [*Chapter 1*](B17492_01_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013),
    *Defining the Reference Architecture for Enterprise DevOps*. In this section,
    we will learn how DevOps has evolved over the years and what the impact of modern
    DevOps has been on enterprise **information technology** (**IT**). We will also
    study how DevOps helps in transforming legacy applications by app modernization.

- en: A lot of enterprises decided in the 1990s that IT was not a core business and
    could be outsourced to suppliers. Typically, all management—operations—of commodity
    IT was outsourced. It created not only silos within enterprises, but also outside
    of them. Over time, IT got more complex, demands increased, and enterprises found
    themselves in a position of having to find ways to get back into the driving seat
    of IT, which had become core for the business.

    is handled in the same way as the development of applications and infrastructure,
    by continuous improvement and not solely by reacting to attacks, threats, or breaches.
    Code that has been developed will immediately be merged with the security code,
    integrating the security posture. Security is developed at the same speed as applications
    and infrastructure. *Section 3* of this book, *Bridging Security with DevSecOps*,

    or intelligent DevOps. With enhanced technologies such as **artificial intelligence**

    automation can really be leveraged. Examples are self-healing systems or code
    and pipelines that *learn* autonomously from previous deployments. With RPA, processes
    can be highly automated and, if combined with AI/ML, think about logical next

    Next, who is mandated to state that assets are trusted and may be applied to the
    pipeline? Is that the security engineer, or can it be delegated to the developer?

    have massive programs to transform mainframe applications to cloud providers such
    as **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**), even running **common business-oriented
    language** (**COBOL**). The reason for enterprises *shifting* their old mainframe
    applications to the cloud is easy to understand. The original code is left intact
    as much as possible, but it's moved from expensive on-premises equipment to pay-as-you-go
    cloud environments, where risks are fairly low. The downside is that companies
    will still need to have resources with COBOL programming skills to maintain the
    app itself. In other words, the application itself is still legacy and will probably
    not be able to adopt and benefit from new cloud-native technology. The next step
    would be to also modernize the application by, for instance, rewriting the code
    or rebuilding the functionality in a completely new application.

- en: '**Rehosting**: This is the lift and shift of existing systems *as they are*.
    The application is picked up and moved to another target platform. The application
    is not changed in any way whatsoever. However, moving an application from—for
    instance—an on-premises environment to AWS or Azure will imply some modifications,
    especially in connectivity. These modifications will be very minimal and will
    not impact the application itself. A common way of rehosting is exporting the
    VM, including the operating system and application code as a whole, to the new
    cloud environment. It''s a fast way to migrate applications to the cloud, but
    by doing so, enterprises will not experience real benefits from cloud services.
    They simply run their machines in another data center—in this case, the cloud
    data centers of AWS, Azure, or any other public cloud provider.'

    the cloud. A very common example is replatforming databases to PaaS. Database
    instances are moved to AWS **Relational Database Service** (**RDS**) or Azure
    **Structured Query Language** (**SQL**), both native database services managed
    by the platforms. Developers will still be able to program databases the way they''re

    it is: only the underlying technology is changed. Take the COBOL example at the
    beginning of this section: COBOL could be rewritten to C# or Java. However, architects
    and engineers would first need to decouple the business logic from the code itself.

    changes to rebuilding.'

    chapter. Code is pulled from a repository, changed, tested, and pushed to the
    next stage. Code follows a promotion path: from development to test, acceptance,
    and—eventually—production systems. Development and test systems might not always
    be needed; they simply have to be there whenever they are required in the process.
    If the work is done, then these systems might be suspended or even decommissioned.
    The benefit of the cloud is that enterprises don''t pay for these systems if they''re
    not in use, in contradiction with on-premises hardware that has been purchased
    as a one-off investment. So, the scaling up of development and test systems on
    demand is a huge advantage of cloud infrastructure.'

    using cloud infrastructure is the ability to have automatic scaling. However,
    architects and engineers might want to be a bit careful with automated scaling.
    It's true that enterprises pay for what they use in the cloud, whereas in the
    traditional way of working enterprises would need to buy physical machines whenever
    extra capacity was needed. The good side about that was that architects really
    needed to think about the required capacity.

    could be further from the truth, though. In cases of peak demand and automated
    scaling without setting limits, the cloud bill will turn out to be a surprise.
    Enterprises, especially financial officers, should therefore not completely rely
    on scaling. In other words, architects will still have a responsibility to plan
    capacity.

    The server has one processor, 2 **gigabytes** (**GB**) of memory, and 100 GB of
    disk storage. If we scale up, we add processors, memory, or disk storage to that
    server. We are adding resources to the same machine and increasing its capacity.
    That can be done as long as there''s room in the server to add resources. We can
    imagine that this is easier in a coded, virtual world than with a physical machine
    where engineers really need to take out their screwdrivers and mount, for instance,
    extra memory cards in that server. The following diagram shows the principle of

    or pools of servers can be added automatically whenever the load is increasing
    and existing servers can''t handle it anymore without degrading the performance.
    As soon as the load decreases, the environment is scaled down again. Load balancers—an

    The driver behind this is interoperability of systems between different platforms.
    Containers seem to be a very good solution to have software interoperable across
    platforms, with ultimate scalability. There are, however, a few things that an
    architect needs to consider. To start with, they must understand that containers
    also need infrastructure to land on. Containers do not run by themselves.
  id: totrans-88
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Containers are operated on compute clusters with a management layer that enables
    the sharing of resources and the scheduling of tasks to workloads that reside
    within the containers. Resources are compute clusters, a group of servers—commonly
    referred to as nodes—that host the containers. The management or orchestration
    layer makes sure that these nodes work as one unit to run containers and execute
    processes—the tasks—that are built inside the containers.
  id: totrans-89
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The cluster management tracks the usage of resources in the cluster such as
    memory, processing power, and storage, and next assigns containers to these resources
    so that the cluster nodes are utilized in an optimized way and applications run
    well.
  id: totrans-90
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other words, scaling containers is not so much about the containers themselves,
    but more about scaling the underlying infrastructure. To make this a bit easier,
    Google invented the orchestration platform Kubernetes that takes care of cluster
    management. Kubernetes uses pods, enabling the sharing of data and application
    code among different containers, acting as one environment. Take the last sentence
    quite literally. Pods work with the **share fate** principle, meaning that if
    one container dies in the pod, all containers go with it.

    nodes. If required, pods are replicated, making sure that the specified number
    of containers is running.

- en: Containers are a good solution, but there are still some shortcomings. The most
    important one is that containers and clusters might be interoperable, but typically,
    networks and storage layers are not. In order to scale container solutions, we
    also need networks and storage layers to be *integrated*. For example, Azure Blob
    is a different beast from AWS **Simple Storage Service** (**S3**), yet Kubernetes
    runs on both platforms using **Azure Kubernetes Services** (**AKS**) and **Elastic
    Kubernetes Services** (**EKS**) on AWS. There will be solutions to overcome this,
    but it's definitely something to take into account when planning container platforms.

    large, traditional enterprises, but it is possible. In this chapter, we learned
    that we can start small and then slowly expand. Starting small doesn''t mean that
    an enterprise doesn''t need to have an end goal in mind: the enterprise architect
    has a key role in defining the target operating model and the way the enterprise
    will develop and operate products in the future. A CoE with SMEs can guide in
    this transformation.'

    to be transformed. We've discussed modern DevOps and using cloud and cloud-native
    technology. We also learned about different transformation strategies for applications
    and how we can develop new applications in DevOps mode using RAD.

    be developed and managed in a DevOps way, if we focus on resilience and reliability
    of these systems. SRE is a method to cover this. We will learn about architecture
    in SRE in the next chapter.
