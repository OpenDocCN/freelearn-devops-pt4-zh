			<h1 id="_idParaDest-64"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Chapter 5</em>: Architecting Next-Level DevOps with SRE</h1>
			<p>In previous chapters, we discussed the ins and outs of DevOps. It's called DevOps for a reason, but in practice, the Dev is typically emphasized: creating agility by speeding up the development. <strong class="bold">Site Reliability Engineering</strong> (<strong class="bold">SRE</strong>) addresses Ops very strongly. How does Ops survive under the ever-increasing speed and number of products that Dev delivers? The answer is SRE teams, working with error budgets and toil. </p>
			<p>After completing this chapter, you will have learned the basic principles of SRE and how you can help an enterprise adopt and implement them. You will have a good understanding of how to define <strong class="bold">Key Performance Indicators</strong> (<strong class="bold">KPIs</strong>) for SRE and what benefits these will bring to the organization.  </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding the basic principles of SRE</li>
				<li>Assessing the enterprise for SRE readiness</li>
				<li>Architecting SRE using KPIs</li>
				<li>Implementing SRE</li>
				<li>Getting business value out of SRE</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Understanding the basic principles of SRE</h1>
			<p>In this section, we will briefly introduce SRE, originally invented by Google to overcome the problem <a id="_idIndexMarker340"/>of operations completely being swamped by all the new developments that Google launched. There are a lot of definitions of SRE, but in this book, we'll use the definition used by Google itself: the thing that happens if you allow a software engineer to design operations. </p>
			<p>Basically, Google addressed the gap between development and operations. Developers changed code because of demand, while operations tried to avoid services breaking because of these changes. In other words, there was always some sort of tension between dev and ops teams. We will talk about this more in this chapter. </p>
			<p>Now, is SRE the next-level DevOps? The answer to that question is: SRE forms a bridge between Dev and Ops. A logical, next question, in that case, would be: is a bridge necessary? In the <a id="_idIndexMarker341"/>next section, we will learn that putting developers and operations in one team is simply not enough. There's a natural conflict of interest. So, an enterprise will need to do more to really get the benefits from working in DevOps mode. That is exactly what SRE does. </p>
			<p>Key topics in SRE are reliability, scalability, availability, performance, efficiency, and response. These are integrated into seven principles – taken from the SRE Workbook – that are relevant to architecture: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Operations is a software problem</strong>: This is the starting point of SRE. Software will change, yet operations need to remain stable so that services are not interrupted. It means that software needs to be resilient and tested intensively.  </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Work according to Service-Level Objectives (SLOs)</strong>: Set clear targets for the service. What should really be the availability of an application? These are not solely IT-related objectives. Business requirements set the parameters in the first place. It means that projects have to work together closely with business stakeholders to define the objectives. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Work to minimize toil</strong>: We will further discuss toil, but in principle, toil means just work. Moreover, toil is manual work that can be avoided through automation. Basically, the ambition of SRE is to get computers to do the work for you, as much as possible.  </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Automate</strong>: After principle three, this one is logical. If you can automate it, do so. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fail fast</strong>: Failure is OK, as long as it's discovered at a very early stage. Fixing the issue in that early stage will have a much lower impact than when it's discovered and fixed at a later moment in the development and deployment cycle. Also, finding and fixing problems at an early stage will lead to lower costs. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Every team member is an owner</strong>: This one requires a bit more explanation, especially in large enterprises where we typically have a matrix organization. Again, remember that a lot of enterprises work in sourcing models where specific suppliers are responsible for the infrastructure (the platform) and other suppliers and the enterprise itself for the applications (the products). In SRE, these boundaries don't exist. Both products and platform teams share the responsibility for the end product. Hence, products and platform teams need to have the same view on every component: application code, frontend systems, backend infrastructure, and security rules. They are all equal owners of the project. <p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">We will discuss this in more detail in <a href="B17492_06_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor077"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Defining Operations in Architecture</em>, where we will learn about platform ops and product ops.  </p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Use one toolset</strong>: All teams use the same tools. You can have multiple SRE teams, but they all work with the same tools. The reasoning behind this is that an enterprise will have to spend too much time managing the different toolsets, instead of focusing on the project deliverables. And SRE is mainly about focus. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>There's no way <a id="_idIndexMarker342"/>to summarize SRE in just a few paragraphs, or even one chapter. This section is merely a very short introduction. Still, SRE can bring a lot to an enterprise – if the enterprise is ready for that. SRE also means changing the way of working and with that, the organization. In the next section, we will learn more about that.  </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Assessing the enterprise for SRE readiness</h1>
			<p>In the previous section, we introduced SRE and discussed the basic principles, without the ambition <a id="_idIndexMarker343"/>of being comprehensive. Covering SRE as a whole would fill a book with well over 500 pages; we have merely given a quick overview of the most important parts. Now the question is: how do I know whether my company is ready for SRE? We will explore some criteria for SRE readiness in this section.</p>
			<p>One of the common problems of companies implementing DevOps is that developers and operations are not really working together. They might sit in one team, but still there will be developers writing code and <em class="italic">throwing it over the fence</em> to operations when they think the code is done. The reason is that dev works with a different mindset than ops. Developers want to change. They get their assignments from business demand to improve or <a id="_idIndexMarker344"/>build new applications. Operators, on the other hand, don't want that change. Their main interest is to have stable systems that don't suffer from outages because of incidents or, indeed, changes. There's a conflict of interest, to begin with.</p>
			<p>The question is how to bridge this conflict. SRE is the answer to that. However, SRE is a methodology that will only succeed if teams are ready to work with that methodology. So, one of the first things that we need to assess is culture. And yes: the enterprise architect does play a role in this. It's about processes and getting people to adopt these processes. Remember that an architecture is not only about the <em class="italic">what</em>, but also the <em class="italic">how</em>. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Redefining risk management </h2>
			<p>Developers will change code; operations need to be sure that the systems remain stable so that business is not halted. Changes might lead to downtime. If downtime is planned, then there's little to worry about. The key here is unplanned downtime. Hence, we need to focus on <a id="_idIndexMarker345"/>mitigating the risk of unforeseen outages due to changes. To avoid outages, systems need to be reliable and resilient. Since in DevOps iterations and changes are continuously deployed, the need to design for reliability becomes increasingly important. Architects need to design systems in such a way that they can handle changes without interrupting services. </p>
			<p>Let's first agree on the definition of risk management. The basic rule is that risk equals probability times impact. Enterprises use risk management to determine the business value of implementing measures that limit either the probability and/or the impact – or, to put it in SRE terminology, risk management is used to determine the value of reliability engineering. Plus, it defines the level of investment to prevent, reduce, or transfer the risk. </p>
			<p>Risk management is used to prioritize reliability measures in the product backlogs of SRE teams. That is done by following the risk matrix referred to as PRACT:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Prevent</strong>: The risk is avoided completely.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reduce</strong>: The impact or likeliness that the risk occurs is reduced.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Accept</strong>: The consequences of the risk are accepted. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Contingency</strong>: Measures are planned and executed when the risk occurs.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Transfer</strong>: The consequences of the risk are transferred, for instance, to an insurance company. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>An example <a id="_idIndexMarker346"/>of a risk matrix is provided in the following template:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer038" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_05_001.jpg" alt="Figure 5.1 – Template for risk assessment&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.1 – Template for risk assessment</p>
			<p>First, we need to identify and rate the risk. What is the risk, what are the chances that it will occur, and what will the impact be? That is shown in the top half of the figure. Then, we need to think about mitigations, actions that can or must be taken to prevent the risk or reduce the impact of the risk. When mitigating actions reduce the risk levels, then there will be a risk residue. Again, the team will need to assess what the impact of that residue will be and whether that's acceptable. </p>
			<p>If the impact of failure is high, it might be worthwhile to look at a strategy that prevents the risk. This will drive the SLOs, or how good a system should be. If the availability is set to 99.99%, then the error budget is only 0.01%. This has consequences for the architecture of the system; after all, the risk rating allows for just 52 minutes of downtime per year. The architecture needs to cater for that, for instance, by having mirrored, hot standby systems that can take over as soon as primary systems fail. </p>
			<p>But what about the code? There are two crucial elements in having resilient code:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The source code needs to be stored securely in a repository with strong access and version control. Code change needs to be fully traceable.</li>
				<li>Automation of continuous tests to detect defects in code in every stage of the development and deployment. Tests and automation are likely the most important features architects will need to cover in DevOps, ensuring resilient and secure code. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Even if we as <a id="_idIndexMarker347"/>architects have done everything to prevent systems going down or software failing, we will encounter problems every now and then. An important rule within SRE is the blameless post-mortem. We will discuss that in the <em class="italic">Architecting SRE using KPIs</em> section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Redefining governance</h2>
			<p>DevOps already assumes that teams are working in a highly autonomous way, meaning that they are <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>responsible for the entire product from beginning to end. This requires different governance. In the previous chapter, we discussed the center of excellence as an organization to guide and support the DevOps teams. The center defines the overall enterprise roadmaps and frameworks that provide the guardrails to develop and manage systems. </p>
			<p>Now, DevOps is still about dev and ops, virtually still divided. SRE teams don't have that division. SRE teams are for that reason different from DevOps teams. SRE teams are cross-domain, meaning that they focus on monitoring the systems, logging, and processing events and automation. They help in developing and implementing automation, but also advise and guide in doing releases in the DevOps process. SRE engineers are able to help in defining system architecture, but can also assist in advancing the enterprise architecture by advising in best practices and selecting the right tools. </p>
			<p>There are <a id="_idIndexMarker349"/>three ways of setting up SRE teams: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Team with dedicated SRE engineers</strong>: These teams are separated from the DevOps teams, but support the DevOps teams. A big advantage is that a lot of teams and different projects are supported at the same time, with the same vision, tools, and processes, improving the overall quality of the different projects.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Embedded model</strong>: SRE engineers are embedded in the DevOps teams. The advantage of this <a id="_idIndexMarker350"/>approach is that SRE engineers can focus on specific issues within projects they are assigned to. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Distributed SRE model</strong>: In this model, the SRE team works more as a center of excellence with specialists that can be consulted to solve issues. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>A typical way to position SRE is presented in the following figure:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer039" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_05_002.jpg" alt="Figure 5.2 – Position of SRE in DevOps&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.2 – Position of SRE in DevOps</p>
			<p>One thing <a id="_idIndexMarker351"/>must be absolutely clear, and that is that SRE requires a change of culture. SRE focuses on improving operations, yet also facilitating development and releases at high velocity. It often means that SRE specialists require a high level of standardization of technology and processes. If development and operations are standardized, then it's also easier to automate processes. By doing that, SRE drives down the probability that risks materialize. As a result, engineers are freed up to pick up other tasks instead of having to spend a lot of time solving problems. That's the key takeaway of SRE. </p>
			<p>The next question is how an organization can implement SRE. That starts with defining KPIs. In the next section, we will study the most important KPIs in SRE.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Architecting SRE using KPIs</h1>
			<p>Before we <a id="_idIndexMarker352"/>dive into the definition of KPIs, we need to <a id="_idIndexMarker353"/>get back to the basic principles of SRE. SRE teams focus on reliability, scalability, availability, performance, efficiency, and response. These are all measurable items, so we can transform <a id="_idIndexMarker354"/>them into KPIs. In this section, we will learn how to do that using SLOs, <strong class="bold">Service-Level Indicators</strong> (<strong class="bold">SLIs</strong>), and the error budget. </p>
			<p>The main KPIs that we use in SRE are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">SLOs</strong>: In SRE, this is defined as <em class="italic">how good a system should be</em>. An SLO is much more <a id="_idIndexMarker355"/>precise than an SLA, which comprises a lot of different KPIs. You could also state that the SLA comprises a number of SLOs. However, an SLO is an agreement between the developers in the SRE team and the product owner of the service, whereas an SLA is an agreement between the service supplier and the end user. <p>The SLO is a target value. For example, the web frontend should be able to handle hundreds of requests per minute. Don't make it too complex at the start. By setting this SLO, the team already has a number of challenges to be able to meet this target, since it will not only involve the frontend but also the throughput on, for instance, the network and involved databases. In other words, by setting this one target, architects and developers will have a lot of work to do to reach that target. </p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">SLIs</strong>: SLOs are <a id="_idIndexMarker356"/>measured by SLIs. In SRE, there are a couple of indicators that are really important: request latency, system throughput, availability, and the error rate. These are the key SLIs, measuring how good a system really is. Request latency measures the time before a system returns a response. System throughput is the number of requests per second or minute. Availability is <a id="_idIndexMarker357"/>the amount of time a system is usable to the end user. The error rate is the percentage of the total number of requests and the number of requests that are successfully returned.  </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Error budget</strong>: This is probably the most important term in SRE. The SLO also defines the <a id="_idIndexMarker358"/>error budget. The budget starts at 100 and is calculated by deducting the SLO. For example, if we have an SLO that says that the availability of a system is 99.9%, then the error budget is <em class="italic">100 – 99.9 = -0,1</em>. This is the room that SRE teams have to apply changes without impacting the SLO. It forces developers in the SRE team to either limit the number of changes and releases or to test and automate as much as possible to avoid disruption of the system and overspending the error budget.   </li>
			</ul>
			<p>To understand the concept of error budget in SRE, it's important to understand how SRE treats <a id="_idIndexMarker359"/>the availability <a id="_idIndexMarker360"/>of systems. It's not simply a matter of deducting the downtime to get to the availability of systems. SRE takes failed requests into account. A failed request can be because a system doesn't respond or has a slow response. Detecting failed requests determines the availability and thus whether the error budget is exceeded or not. Important parameters are as follows:  </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">TTD</strong>: The <strong class="bold">time to detect</strong> an issue <a id="_idIndexMarker361"/>in software or a system.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">TTR</strong>: The <strong class="bold">time to resolve</strong> or repair <a id="_idIndexMarker362"/>the issue.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Frequency/year</strong>: The frequency of error per year.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Users</strong>: The number of users that are impacted by the error.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Bad/year</strong>: The number of minutes per year that a system is not usable, or the <em class="italic">bad minutes</em> per year. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Working with the error budget is shown in the following workflow: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer040" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_05_003.jpg" alt="Figure 5.3 – Working with the error budget&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.3 – Working with the error budget</p>
			<p>Risk should be perceived as business risk: something endangering the business of the enterprise. Recognizing that risk leads to requirements of systems and software. These requirements are translated into SLOs, defining how good a system should be. SLOs are measured by indicators, telling exactly how good the system really is. If SLOs are not met, they will trigger the risk to materialize. The chance that systems might fail and with that SLOs are not met is the error budget. The error budget – typically when the budget is exceeded – will lead to adjusted requirements and improved systems. </p>
			<p>Despite all <a id="_idIndexMarker363"/>the work we put <a id="_idIndexMarker364"/>into reliability, enterprises will be confronted with issues and, as a consequence of that, outages. A key element in SRE is the blameless post-mortem that can be executed on different levels. We can have post-mortems whenever an incident occurs or after a project has been completed. The blameless post-mortem is really all about culture: it investigates incidents without blaming. SRE teams simply assume that all involved team members have done their very best to avoid the incident.  </p>
			<p>The teams evaluate the issue and come up with advice to avoid the issue occurring again. This can be improvements to the process or the use of tools. Also, advice might be about people, for instance, to get people trained in specific areas. This is not to blame, but always to improve. </p>
			<p>If we put it all together, SRE is a truly holistic model. It's about processes, tools, and people. The following diagram shows a holistic view of SRE and how it merges with DevOps:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer041" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_05_004.jpg" alt="Figure 5.4 – Holistic view of SRE&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.4 – Holistic view of SRE</p>
			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker365"/>section, we introduced <a id="_idIndexMarker366"/>the main aspects of SRE. The top question and challenge for most enterprises is: where do we start? We will discuss that in the next section. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>Implementing SRE</h1>
			<p>So far, we have learned what SRE is and what the key elements are. In this section, we will learn <a id="_idIndexMarker367"/>how to start with SRE, but like DevOps, the advice is to start small. Then there are two major steps that will help you to implement SRE in a controlled way:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Agree on the standards and practices</strong>: This can be for just one SRE team or for the entire <a id="_idIndexMarker368"/>enterprise if the ambition reaches that level. In some workbooks this is called <strong class="bold">kitchen sink</strong>, meaning that everything is SRE. This can be a viable approach for companies with a limited set of applications, but for enterprises, it might be wiser to work with an SRE team charter. <p>Let's work with a very common example that we will also use in the next chapters. Enterprises usually have product teams working on applications and a platform team that is responsible for the infrastructure. It's good practice to have an SRE team bridging between one product team and the platform team, setting out <a id="_idIndexMarker369"/>standards and practices for this particular domain. The product team will focus on the delivery of the application, obviously working closely together with the platform team. The SRE team can guide this and set standards for the reliability of the end product. It means that SRE teams have to cover multiple domains, as shown in the following figure:</p></li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer042" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_05_005.jpg" alt="Figure 5.5 – Domains of SRE&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.5 – Domains of SRE</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Agree on the scope of services</strong>: Certainly, at the beginning of the SRE journey, SRE teams can't do everything. Therefore, we need to agree on the scope of the SRE team. Will they only do consulting or will they be actively involved in the DevOps projects? Or will they only be involved in the automation of DevOps? Some companies have specific SRE teams for tooling, a tools-only SRE team that is only concerned with implementing automation tools, overarching DevOps. The final step in SRE is <em class="italic">on call</em>, whenever issues arise during operations and exceed the error budget. Then, SRE engineers are called in to investigate <a id="_idIndexMarker370"/>the issue, guide in the post-mortem, and help implement new solutions that ensure reliability. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Since SRE is a Google invention, Google has published extensive guidelines to implement SRE step by step. Google identifies three entry acceptance criteria to start with SRE:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">SLOs</strong> have been defined and agreed with business owners.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Blameless post-mortems</strong> can be executed.</li>
				<li>The enterprise <a id="_idIndexMarker371"/>has a process in place to manage production issues. This can be the standard <strong class="bold">incident management</strong> process as defined in IT service management frameworks such as ITIL.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Where does SRE start and how do teams begin their work?</p>
			<ol>
				<li>SRE specialists are hired or trained within the enterprise.</li>
				<li>Release processes are documented and evaluated by SRE specialists.</li>
				<li>Operational processes are documented, including runbooks for releases and handover to operations. These processes are evaluated by SRE specialists.</li>
				<li>SLOs have been defined and agreed upon.</li>
				<li>SRE teams are mandated to adapt and implement processes that reduce toil. Collaboration with developers and operations resulting in a buy-in is a prerequisite.  </li>
			</ol>
			<p>The latter is crucial, but even more important is that SRE teams do this without <em class="italic">blaming</em> as discussed in the previous section about the blameless post-mortem. Every single assessment of procedures, processes, and the root cause of failing systems should be without pointing fingers, but only focusing on improvements. SRE teams can do this for all new and existing processes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>SLO and error budget review</li>
				<li>Incident reviews</li>
				<li>Test and runbook reviews</li>
				<li>Security audits</li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, before the team can really start, the organization needs to have clear priorities. As we have learned, SRE will trigger a change of culture and the whole organization will have to support the implementation of SRE. Apart from the model that we use to implement SRE teams – dedicated, embedded, or distributed – the guidelines and guardrails of SRE will impact the entire enterprise. That means that the enterprise must have a strategy. </p>
			<p>Typically, enterprises do not start from a <em class="italic">greenfield</em> situation. There are existing products, projects, and processes that can't be changed overnight. Google recognized this when it <a id="_idIndexMarker372"/>introduced the methodology. Enterprises are usually <em class="italic">brownfield</em> that enter a transformation. In that case, they need to think of priorities and how to start the transformation. In 2013, Google's SRE engineer Mickey Dickerson came up with the Hierarchy of Reliability. The model is as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer043" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_05_006.jpg" alt="Figure 5.6 – Dickerson's Hierarchy of Reliability&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.6 – Dickerson's Hierarchy of Reliability</p>
			<p>The idea of the pyramid is that the items at the bottom are the basics that need to be implemented first; they form the foundation. From there the transformation progresses to more advanced items, such as the release chain in the development and deployment of new products at the very top of the pyramid.</p>
			<p>We have identified our goals and objectives, assigned teams, and agreed on the priorities in <a id="_idIndexMarker373"/>the implementation. But will SRE actually bring benefits to the enterprise? We will answer that question in the final section of this chapter.</p>
			<p>Getting business value out of SRE</p>
			<p>As we have learned in the previous section, enterprises don't implement SRE in just a few days. It takes <a id="_idIndexMarker374"/>time and stamina to get it right. But is it worth it? Obviously, the answer is yes. SRE will allow for great business value. In this final section, we will explain how. </p>
			<p>Today's enterprises are continuously transforming. It puts a lot of pressure on operations that on one side have to keep up with developments and on the other side have to keep systems stable and reliable. Without true collaboration between developers and operations, that's virtually impossible. SRE addresses this challenge. SRE recognizes that putting dev and ops together in one room doesn't solve the problem. SRE creates a solution that reduces operational issues by helping developers to build reliable systems. Key components are as follows:  </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Standardization</strong>: Standardize <a id="_idIndexMarker375"/>processes and tools.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Automation</strong>: Automation <a id="_idIndexMarker376"/>leads to consistency, but automation also enables scaling. This requires a very well-thought-out architecture. Automation is about doing something once and then letting automation take care of the rest. Without automation, operations would simply be drowned by manual tasks.  </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Eliminate toil</strong>: Toil is <a id="_idIndexMarker377"/>manual work, repetitive, and can be automated. But toil is also work that doesn't add value to the product: it's interruptive and slows down the development of services that do add value.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Simplicity</strong>: Software needs to be simple as a prerequisite to a stable, reliable system. Code <a id="_idIndexMarker378"/>needs to be simple and clean and APIs as minimal as possible. SRE lives by the golden rule of less is more. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>By doing this, the enterprise will benefit from high-velocity developments, yet spending fewer resources in fixing issues. Time and resources can then be invested into further improvements. So, enterprises can gain a lot from adopting SRE. Because SRE involves a very systematic <a id="_idIndexMarker379"/>way to build, manage, and review systems, enterprises can trust reliable services. Repetitive tasks are taken over by standardization and automation. The business gains on multiple sides here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Reliable services will gain trust with customers and likely more revenue. </li>
				<li>Because of automation, manual tasks are reduced. This will drive the costs of operations down. The very first thing that SRE engineers will do is automate repetitive tasks. </li>
				<li>Because of standardization, systems will become more reliable and stable, causing fewer issues and outages. Analyzing issues and solving problems require resources and are therefore very costly. They don't add value to the business, but they need to be addressed in order to not stop the business.  </li>
				<li>Cost savings might be invested in the development of new features and new products. In other words: SRE will be a driver for innovation. SRE will bring a lot of benefits to an enterprise, but implementation requires dedication and the willingness to adopt a different culture. As with anything in Agile and DevOps, the recommendation is to start small and then scale up throughout the enterprise. Learn from mistakes, optimize, and continuously improve. </li>

			<p>This chapter covered the basics of SRE. The original workbook contains well over 500 pages, so it's almost impossible to summarize the methodology in just a few pages. Yet, after completing this chapter you will have a good understanding of the founding principles of SRE, starting with the definition of SLOs to set requirements on how good a system should be. Subsequently, we measure the SLOs with indicators that tell us how good the system really is. We learned that by working with risk management, error budgets, and blameless post-mortems, SRE engineers can help DevOps teams to improve systems and make them more reliable.</p>
			<p>The conclusion of the chapter was that SRE is not very easy to implement in an enterprise. We discussed the first steps of the implementation and learned that if done right, SRE will lead to benefits. Businesses will gain from SRE because a lot of manual work can be reduced, creating room to improve products or develop new ones.  </p>
			<p>This concludes the first part of this book. In the next part, we will take the next step and learn how modern technologies can help the enterprise and further optimize operations. One of the promising new technologies is artificial intelligence and with that, we introduce AIOps in the second part of this book. </p>
