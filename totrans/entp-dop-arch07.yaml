- en: In this part, you will learn about the role and mandate of ops in an enterprise
    and how this is embedded into the architecture. You will also learn that the role
    of ops is changing. In DevOps, ops are linked to developers. The aim of DevOps
    is to increase the velocity of development. As a consequence, ops will need to
    be more efficient, spending less time running operations. This is what AIOps brings
    to the table, automation and intelligence to discover abnormalities much faster
    and even solve them with auto-remediation. How do architects design systems that
    are ready for AIOps and maybe even the shift left to NoOps?
