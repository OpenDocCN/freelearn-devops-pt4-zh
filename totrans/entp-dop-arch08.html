			<h1 id="_idParaDest-75"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>Chapter 6</em>: Defining Operations in Architecture </h1>
			<p>The role of operations is changing in enterprises that adopt DevOps. The number one task of operations is to keep services up and running, but in the new digital operating model, a lot of these tasks can and will be automated. Before we start thinking about automating operations, we need to have a clear view of roles, mandates, activities, and domains of operations in the enterprise. This chapter is the guardrail to capturing ops in the enterprise architecture. We will learn how to design architecture for operations and define the digital operating model.</p>
			<p>After completing this chapter, you will have learned what the roles and responsibilities are of operations and how this can be addressed in the architecture. We will also see how operations is changing and impacted by the cloud, cloud-native services, and event-driven architectures that use microservices. We will design a digital operating model while making a distinction between platform and product operations. Finally, we will discuss how to elevate the enterprise to continuous operations. </p>
			<p> In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding operations management</li>
				<li>Defining operations in an enterprise architecture</li>
				<li>Defining the digital operating demarcation model</li>
				<li>Understanding ops in an event-driven architecture</li>
				<li>Planning operations with a maturity model</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>Understanding operations management</h1>
			<p>Before we can start defining operations management in an enterprise architecture, including the <a id="_idIndexMarker380"/>roles and demarcations between these roles, we <a id="_idIndexMarker381"/>need to understand what IT operations include. In this section, we will discuss the definition of IT operations and <strong class="bold">IT Operations Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">ITOM</strong>). </p>
			<p>First, why is this important? DevOps has a tendency to focus on development: exploring and building new features and new products. In discussing release management and CI/CD, there's also focus on the development and deployment process. But operations is just as important as development, and the role of IT operations is changing. Not only because of DevOps, but also because of the digital transformation that a lot of enterprises are going through. We will learn more about this in this section.</p>
			<p>As a short definition, we can say that IT operations includes all the processes that support hardware and software that are used by the enterprise to fulfill customers' services. So, IT operations is responsible for the functionality of end user devices such as laptops, but also <a id="_idIndexMarker382"/>for products that deliver services to customers of the enterprise. A simple example is a website where customers can order goods, including its infrastructure (web server) and application code (frontend application and database). IT operations also have a major task in assuring the quality of IT assets. </p>
			<p>The following processes are important in ITOM:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Monitoring</strong>: IT operations are the eyes of IT, so robust, resilient monitoring systems <a id="_idIndexMarker383"/>are crucial. There's not really a <em class="italic">one size fits all</em> approach when it comes to monitoring. Operations will work with different systems to control the infrastructure, the applications, interfaces, backup jobs, and many other components. The challenge is to get one overview out of these systems so that system states, failures, and potential issues can be correlated. For example, a web service might be not responding because the database is not available. End-to-end monitoring is a term that is often used in IT, and it means that monitoring systems simulate transactions throughout the chain of IT systems.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Incident management</strong>: Any event that disrupts the normal operation of systems <a id="_idIndexMarker384"/>is an incident. It's up to operations to identify the incident (using monitoring) and solve it as soon as possible. This can be done by applying a temporary workaround to get systems back to normal, but it's best to fix the issue and make sure it doesn't happen again. That's what problem management is all about.<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p><p class="callout">Being involved in operations for quite a number of years as an architect, there's one important lesson that every engineer and architect should learn well: there's nothing as permanent as a temporary solution to quickly solve an issue. It might be the fastest way to get systems back up and running, but in the long run, these quick fixes will cause new issues. One reason for this is that quick fixes are often not very well documented and after a while, no one knows how they were applied. </p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Problem management</strong>: Here, incidents are analyzed in more depth. Also, trends <a id="_idIndexMarker385"/>in incidents are explored. Operations will need to align with engineers and architects to come up with solutions to prevent incidents from occurring again.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Change control and release management</strong>: Operations will be confronted with <a id="_idIndexMarker386"/>changes to systems and in DevOps, these changes will occur quite often. However, it's the responsibility of operations to ensure that systems keep running without major, unplanned interruptions. This is the change control process. Part of this process might be running a final backup before the change is executed so that system states and data are secured. Developers and operations need to be fully aligned in applying changes. This is done in the process of release management. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the more <a id="_idIndexMarker387"/>traditional way of working, operations will simply receive the new release and then decide when this is deployed so that existing services can continue without any disruptions. In DevOps, the process works differently. Here, the team has a shared responsibility in deploying the new release.</p>
			<p>In short, operations must keep the services up and running under all circumstances. DevOps and digital transformation have a significant impact on operations. Let's review some trends:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cloud and cloud native</strong>: This may sound obvious, but cloud and cloud-native technologies <a id="_idIndexMarker388"/>have an enormous impact on IT operations. The contradiction is that a lot of these technologies aim to reduce the complexity in the IT landscape, but on the other hand, they add complexity with cloud-born assets. The IT landscape is turning more and more into an API ecosystem, where operations have to manage <a id="_idIndexMarker389"/>not only virtual machines, applications, and network connections, but also <strong class="bold">Application Programmable Interfaces</strong> (<strong class="bold">APIs</strong>) that connect the PaaS and SaaS <a id="_idIndexMarker390"/>solutions to the IT landscape of the enterprise.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data center decommissioning</strong>: With enterprises moving IT systems to cloud platforms, it's logical to assume that the private owned data centers are being emptied <a id="_idIndexMarker391"/>and decommissioned. Here, traditional operations work, including datacenter management, is not disappearing, but being transformed into managing the virtual data center in cloud platforms. Once more, everything is turning into code, whereas in traditional data centers, operators would still have physical machines to look after.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Faster networks</strong>: There's less of a need to have systems near the enterprise itself. Systems can be hosted in global cloud platforms. High-speed network connections <a id="_idIndexMarker392"/>solve problems with latency, so there's virtually no limit to where systems can <em class="italic">land</em>. In the near future, we will see faster networks coming to the market: it's a requirement for a lot of new services that are being developed. Think of real-time data analytics, quantum computing or simulation, and technologies that rely on high-speed connections to, for instance, transmit images across the world. Networks are the foundation for everything, and operations will need to focus more on the resilience, agility, and performance of these networks.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Globalization</strong>: Global cloud providers such as Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud <a id="_idIndexMarker393"/>have data centers around the globe. There's a big benefit in being able to have disaster recovery enabled in a completely different region, thus increasing the resiliency of systems. However, there's also a lot to consider, such as if enterprises are bound by legal regulations to have data within the borders of the country or region where they reside or deliver services. Globalization of IT has pros, but also cons. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Shift to left-left</strong>: The idea of knowledge sharing in IT has gained a lot of momentum <a id="_idIndexMarker394"/>over the past few years. Shift left also means that IT systems cater for <em class="italic">self-help</em>: systems are designed in such a way that users can easily find ways to overcome issues. With shift left-left, an element is added to this: systems are learning from users and adapting <a id="_idIndexMarker395"/>software so that the issue doesn't occur again. This is <a id="_idIndexMarker396"/>where the final trend will play a huge role: <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>) and <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>).</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">AI and ML</strong>: Last but not least, one of the major trends that will change the operations <a id="_idIndexMarker397"/>domain is AI and ML. This includes self-learning, self-healing systems, and systems that can even predict certain behavior and act accordingly to that behavior. In operations. we will see diagnostic systems that learn from issues and either fix these or give advice on how to deal with them. These systems are also capable of correlating events: if a system in the chain fails, AI will know how it will impact other systems in that chain and take mitigating actions, for instance, taking a snapshot of the system's state so that the root cause can be identified faster and more accurately.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>At this point, you should <a id="_idIndexMarker398"/>know that operations will not become easier and that IT won't become less complex. This complexity will shift and transform. The good news is that these new technologies will allow you to predict system behavior better, design for more resiliency, and reduce risks further by finding the root causes of issues faster and taking swift, accurate corrective actions. </p>
			<p>How does this fit into our architecture? We will discuss this in the next section. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>Defining operations in an enterprise architecture</h1>
			<p>IT operations <a id="_idIndexMarker399"/>is not a part of the enterprise <a id="_idIndexMarker400"/>architecture, meaning that an enterprise architecture doesn't define how an enterprise must perform operations. At best, the operations architecture is part of the technical architecture. In this section, we will elaborate on the components of the enterprise architecture and then study <a id="_idIndexMarker401"/>the specifics of the operations <a id="_idIndexMarker402"/>architecture.</p>
			<p>The enterprise architecture includes the following architectural components:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Business architecture</strong>: This covers the business functions and the organization <a id="_idIndexMarker403"/>of the business, including its operations. From the business architecture, it should be clear how products and services are delivered, as well as what processes are followed for designing, building, and running them. The business architecture starts with the product strategy, which includes describing the products and services that the enterprise delivers.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Governance architecture</strong>: This defines who's responsible for fulfilling processes. This is the blueprint for how the enterprise operates, including the tactical <a id="_idIndexMarker404"/>plans for IT that state how processes are implemented, operated, and monitored. <p>Ops are key components in both the business and governance architecture. Ops is responsible for delivering products and services in a stable manner throughout the whole delivery chain. It's important to realize that there is a difference between operational service management and operations management, with the latter often referred to as ITOM. Service management comprises the typical ITSM or ITIL processes that we discussed in the first section about <em class="italic">Understanding operations management</em>, such as incident and problem management. ITOM is more IT technology oriented and focuses on the operations of applications and infrastructure. The enterprise architecture also addresses this.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data architecture</strong>: This describes how data is used; that is, why and by who or what <a id="_idIndexMarker405"/>process to fulfill a service. Operations have a role in making and keeping data available according to the data principles of an enterprise. These principles typically involve <a id="_idIndexMarker406"/>data privacy and compliancy rules. Due to this, operations need to work closely with security and data privacy officers. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Applications architecture</strong>: This describes the build and usage of applications. Again, operations play a key role in keeping the applications running, including databases and middleware. It's highly recommended to involve <a id="_idIndexMarker407"/>operations in the very first stage of application development, to make sure that applications can really be managed by operations. Think of applying new cloud-native technologies to applications: an enterprise needs to be sure that operations have the skills to operate these technologies.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Technology architecture</strong>: Finally, this describes all the technical components that <a id="_idIndexMarker408"/>are used in the enterprise. It should include products such as hardware and software, standards and principles, services, and policies.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker409"/>diagram shows the levels <a id="_idIndexMarker410"/>in the enterprise architecture:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer046" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_06_001.jpg" alt="Figure 6.1 – Components of the enterprise architecture&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.1 – Components of the enterprise architecture</p>
			<p>The operations architecture can be part of the technology architecture, but at a more detailed level. It includes the following components at a minimum:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Production scheduling/monitoring</li>
				<li>System monitoring</li>
				<li>Performance monitoring</li>
				<li>Network monitoring</li>
				<li>Event management (incidents, problems, changes)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Two items deserve special attention:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Service-level agreements (SLAs)</strong>: The contract between a supplier and a customer <a id="_idIndexMarker411"/>that describes exactly what conditions <a id="_idIndexMarker412"/>a service is provided with, typically using <strong class="bold">key performance indicators</strong> (<strong class="bold">KPIs</strong>). Operations need to deliver the service according to these KPIs.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Operating-level agreements (OLAs)</strong>: Part of the SLA can be OLAs, defining the interdependent relationships between components, and composing <a id="_idIndexMarker413"/>the service that is covered by the SLA. For example, the SLA might describe a web application that needs to be available 99.9% percent of the time. The application itself might be depending on database services that are not part of the application chain and are operated by a different ops group. The OLA will address this interdependency.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this section, we concluded that IT is becoming more complex. Enterprises expect more from <a id="_idIndexMarker414"/>operations to keep systems <a id="_idIndexMarker415"/>stable, but also to keep up with new developments. To allow ops to fulfill these increasingly demanding tasks, they need an adjusted operating model that deals with this digital transformation. For that, they also need the right tools. In the next section, we will discuss this new, digital operating model before we step into the world of tools with AIOps. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>Defining the digital operating demarcation model</h1>
			<p>The role and position of operations is changing; we saw that in the first section of this chapter. Besides new and evolving technology impacting operations, the most important reason for this is the shift from projects to product-oriented continuous delivery. </p>
			<p>What do <a id="_idIndexMarker416"/>we mean by this? Most enterprises used to work in projects, typically waterfall type projects. There's a specific end date and the whole project is set out in a timeline with milestones. In DevOps, the focus is on the product: it starts with a Minimal Viable Product, and then the teams keep improving it in short sprints of 2 or 3 weeks. </p>
			<p>At the end of the sprint, the product and the deliverables are reviewed. The developers and operations collaborate with these teams. In the traditional model, operations would get a final product and then decide how and when it would be released. The new operating model has to be more agile, adaptive, and embedded in DevOps. In this section, we will look at that new operating model in more detail. </p>
			<p>It's important to understand what the role of dev is and what the role of ops is in a digital operating model:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Dev designs and deploys.</li>
				<li>Ops fulfills and manages, including detection and correction. However, in DevOps, detection and correction is looping back into dev. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>To create agility, we need to set <strong class="bold">demarcation</strong> in the different ops tasks. We will have operations focusing <a id="_idIndexMarker417"/>on the products and operations focusing on the platform. This is a requirement if we wish to provide product-oriented delivery. In a digital operating model based on agile and DevOps, we have businesses working together with product teams to define the necessary products and their features. Product ops engineers will support the delivery of such products, while the platform engineers will make sure that the platform – the infrastructure – is ready to land the products and provide an enduring stable service. </p>
			<p>The following diagram shows a model with demarcation layers:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer047" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_06_002.jpg" alt="Figure 6.2 – Layered demarcation model with product ops and platform ops&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.2 – Layered demarcation model with product ops and platform ops</p>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker418"/>next section, we will explain the model further:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Platform Ops</strong>: The platform is the landing zone – the foundation. It needs to be there, and it needs to be stable. Product teams should not have to worry about <a id="_idIndexMarker419"/>the availability of the platform. In most digital operating models, the platform is usually a (public) cloud platform. <p>The platform team that manages this is decoupled from the product teams. Platform operations include updates, upgrades, and optimization and also deploys new infrastructure features. These are planned in close cooperation with the product teams to avoid disruptions to services. </p><p>Roles that are advised in platform operations are (cloud) platform manager, (cloud) platform architect, and platform engineers. There might be a great need to have an API integrations specialist in this ops team as well, since platforms are tending to become more like API ecosystems. These APIs, such as SaaS and PaaS solutions, need to be integrated with the platform. </p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Product Ops</strong>: This is the layer where the product is designed, build, deployed, and managed in DevOps mode. Simply put, this is the layer where the product is defined as <a id="_idIndexMarker420"/>a basic idea and through iterations, all of which are eventually brought under product ops control. In this team, we will need platform engineers that bridge the requirements of the product to the platform. These platform engineers need to be trained and skilled in Infrastructure as Code, Configuration as Code, automation, and API programming. They will liaise with platform operations.<p>Ops roles that are advised in this layer and the product team are infrastructure engineers and testers, developers, and specific domain architects who are involved in designing the product. </p><p>One of the <a id="_idIndexMarker421"/>pitfalls of introducing agile and DevOps is that enterprises might step away from the traditional IT service management processes. However, the operational processes that we briefly discussed in the first section about <em class="italic">Understanding operations management</em> are still very valid. This is why, in a digital operating model, we need roles and responsibilities to address these processes: </p><p>- (Major) Incident manager</p><p>- Problem manager</p><p>- Change manager</p><p>- Asset manager</p><p>We can <a id="_idIndexMarker422"/>do this using a RACI matrix. RACI stands for <strong class="bold">Responsible, Accountable, Consulting, and Informed</strong>. The following table represents a simple example of a RACI for service management processes:</p></li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer048" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_06_003.jpg" alt="Figure 6.3 – Example of a RACI matrix for service management processes&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.3 – Example of a RACI matrix for service management processes</p>
			<p>The placing of the <strong class="bold">R</strong>, <strong class="bold">A</strong>, <strong class="bold">C</strong>, and <strong class="bold">I</strong> are debatable, which is fine – as long as it is perfectly clear to all involved who's responsible for what. </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Business</strong>: This is the top level and is where the strategy is laid out and the requirements for the products are defined. In the new digital operating model, new roles <a id="_idIndexMarker423"/>are added to this layer, such as customer journey analysts and designers. The whole idea behind the model is that the enterprise caters for more agility and gets new products to the market faster. The business will need to know what customers want and how they experience the products to make them successful. <p>This is also important for operations. Remember that dev and ops have to be aligned from the beginning to the end. Ops needs to be involved in the customer's journeys too. A specific ops role in this case is the service manager role: they need to be aware of what's coming and how this can be adopted in the new services, all while ensuring the existing services are not disrupted. </p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>There's <a id="_idIndexMarker424"/>one important layer that's missing, but this is actually not a separate layer. Security and security management is an overarching layer and should be embedded in every other layer. </p>
			<p>So, we have engineers and architects on all the layers, closely collaborating. But it should be clear that they need some sort of framework where they can work. That is the enterprise architecture. The enterprise architect sits at the very top of the model, closely working together with the customer journey designers, the domain architects in development, and the architects in operations. </p>
			<p>IT4IT, by The Open Group, addresses this new model and suggests a way forward for enterprises. IT4IT marks four stages or <em class="italic">value streams</em> for products. These value streams are very accurate since IT creates value – a product being developing from an idea and becoming a real service:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Plan</strong>: Strategy to portfolio</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Build</strong>: Requirement to deploy</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Deliver</strong>: Requirement to fulfill</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Run</strong>: Detect to correct</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These <a id="_idIndexMarker425"/>value streams are shown in the following diagram: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer049" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_06_004.jpg" alt="Figure 6.4 – IT4IT value streams&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.4 – IT4IT value streams</p>
			<p>The deliver and run value streams are the ops streams. Request to fulfill includes cataloging, fulfilling, and managing the usage of the service. Run is about anticipating and resolving issues. Ops can help with these tasks by using an event-driven architecture. We will discuss this in the next section. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-79"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>Understanding ops in an event-driven architecture</h1>
			<p>Let's review the most important task of ops once more: keeping services up and running. To enable this, we have defined a number of processes that help manage systems. Incident <a id="_idIndexMarker426"/>and problem management are key processes; that is, in IT4IT terms, detect to correct. The issue is that incident management is almost by default reactive: an issue is detected and actions are triggered to find and fix the issue. In the next phase, typically in problem management, a deeper analysis is done, where solutions are designed to prevent the issue from happening again. </p>
			<p>Event management is a component of operations. The challenge in a digital operating model is to orchestrate and automate these events across different IT systems and even platforms. The event-driven architecture addresses this and is actually the starting point of AIOps. We will discuss this in more detail in <a href="B17492_08_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor095"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Architecting AIOps</em>.</p>
			<p>The event-driven architecture was originally meant to help design applications so that they react to events. An event is defined as a change of state that triggers a reaction. The following diagram provides an example of a build in Archimate:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer050" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_06_005.jpg" alt="Figure 6.5 – Simple Archimate model for processing payments&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.5 – Simple Archimate model for processing payments</p>
			<p>Here, we have a business event: <strong class="bold">Order placed</strong>. This triggers a business function, which in this example is called <strong class="bold">Order fulfillment</strong>. Part of this function is <strong class="bold">Payment</strong>, which triggers an external system at the bank that delivers the payment service. As soon as the payment is accepted, the order leaves the function to the next business event, which is the <strong class="bold">Order delivery</strong>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">Archimate is a <a id="_idIndexMarker427"/>recommended methodology for designing functions and mapping these to processes that need to be fulfilled by IT components. Archimate uses viewpoints to model business processes to applications and technology. A common viewpoint is the product viewpoint, which shows the value that a product delivers to customers. The architect can use Archimate models to define the composition of the product, including the different services and interfaces between the services. Archi is a free tool that can be used to design Archimate models. Archi can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.archimatetool.com/download/">https://www.archimatetool.com/download/</a>.</p>
			<p>In this – very simple – example, the customer pays their placed order. The order status now changes to paid and triggers a process that pushes the order to delivery. In fact, the payment process itself will also trigger other new events, such as a connection that needs to be <a id="_idIndexMarker428"/>established with a bank or payment service. Within the bank, there will be a trigger that checks the back account of the buyer and sends a message to the order system with a status of OK or not OK. </p>
			<p>In short, a change of state will trigger a lot of new events. These events do not have to occur in the same system, as we have seen in this example. Events can drive decisions in other systems that are connected through APIs. This is the foundation of microservices and the <strong class="bold">service-oriented architecture</strong> (<strong class="bold">SOA</strong>). Microservices are contained, independent operating services that communicate with each other using APIs. These services are <a id="_idIndexMarker429"/>managed by self-contained teams that develop, build, and run these services. So, it's fair to say that the event-driven architecture using microservices is well supported by DevOps with teams that are end-to-end responsible for delivering that particular service. </p>
			<p>To enable this type of architecture, we need services to be defined as separate functions that are reusable, scalable, and interoperable. These are the corner stones of SOA and in fact, a lot of cloud technologies are derived from SOA principles. PaaS and SaaS solutions are defined as SOA, which means that they can be reused and shared in different environments, are scalable, and are interoperable between different platforms.</p>
			<p>How does this all impact operations? To put it very simply: they have to keep services – microservices, to be precise – up and running across a lot of different applications, systems, and platforms. Ops must deal with decentralized continuous delivery by using interfaces that connect independent deployed services. The traditional way of monitoring will not be sufficient anymore: ops needs a single pane of glass view – a holistic view of all the services and their interconnections. </p>
			<p>Now, let's go back to our example where we have an order that needs to be paid. The order status will change from not paid to paid and trigger the delivery. The status will only change if the bank has approved the payment, so the trigger to change the status comes from <a id="_idIndexMarker430"/>a service that's outside the service that actually holds the order. If the API between the bank and the order queue fails, the operators will need to know about this. So, monitoring should also include monitoring the API to the bank and checking if the bank service is <em class="italic">online</em>. Here, event monitoring across the full chain becomes key, as shown in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer051" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_06_006.jpg" alt="Figure 6.6 – Full chain event management and monitoring&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.6 – Full chain event management and monitoring</p>
			<p>This will certainly lead to more complexity in ops, and that's why we need to look for ways to automate this as much as possible. Microservices, SOA, and the event-driven architecture create more reliable systems: independent services simply wait for the trigger before the action is executed and the next service is started. Independent services allow for a fire and forget model: a system fires a trigger and then forgets about it; then, the system moves on to the next event and the next trigger. But we want to ensure that the trigger is actually received and maybe even check if the trigger is processed correctly. </p>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker431"/>next few chapters, we will learn how to monitor these processes and how we can automate event management in event-driven systems using microservices. This is exactly what AIOps does: making operations easier by means of AI and ML. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>Planning operations with a maturity model</h1>
			<p>In this section, we will look at a maturity model for IT operations. Then, we will learn how to <a id="_idIndexMarker432"/>apply this to the enterprise and get it to continuous operations. Finally, we'll learn how to get it ready so that it can be implemented by AIOps. </p>
			<p>The basic operations maturity model looks as follows:</p>

			<p>The first level is sometimes referred to as chaotic. Processes are not documented here; operations are merely just firefighting. At this level, it's the tools that define how operations work, instead of having an architecture in place that also defines the toolset. Most enterprises have passed this level. </p>
			<p>However, a lot of enterprises are stuck at the second level. This is the committed level, where processes are defined. Incident, problem change, and project management is in place, but the processes are only integrated in a very limited way. There's no overarching event management or <em class="italic">single pane glass view</em>. In other words, events will still trigger unexpected system behavior and might cause severe disruptions to the business.</p>
			<p>Most enterprises will be somewhere between levels 3 and 4, depending on where they are in their digital transformation. The third, proactive level is already quite challenging to achieve. At this level, enterprises can analyze trends, have end-to-end event monitoring in place, have larger parts of their IT automated, and, most importantly, can predict events and taking proactive measures. This is the level where AIOps can play a significant role. We will learn more about this in <a href="B17492_07_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor086"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Understanding the Impact of AI on DevOps</em>.</p>
			<p>At level 4, IT delivery is fully defined as services to the business. This is the level where the event-driven architecture becomes relevant. Business functions are mapped to IT services. In fact, IT services can support business decisions. There's a well-defined service catalogue and all the processes are integrated, including cost management. The final stage in the maturity model in IT is real-time responsiveness to business events and innovations that are part of operations, thus adding value to the business. This is continuous operations stage, where we loop feedback to the development processes but in real time and in a fully automated fashion. Most enterprises will get there for some applications and some business functions, but hardly ever for the entire enterprise and all business processes.</p>
			<p>The operations <a id="_idIndexMarker433"/>maturity model aligns with the <strong class="bold">Capability Maturity Model</strong> (<strong class="bold">CMM</strong>), which also has five levels. Level 1 is the initial level, where processes are poorly controlled and unpredictable. At level 3, which is where most <a id="_idIndexMarker434"/>companies are at, the processes are clearly defined and well understood, allowing for proactive event management. Level 5 is the optimization level, where processes and delivery are continuously improved. As we mentioned previously, most enterprises will reach this level for certain processes and products, but rarely for the whole enterprise. The CMM model looks as follows:</p>

			<p>Level 3 is the focus level: becoming proactive. In the next few chapters, we will learn how AI and ML can help us with that.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-81"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we discussed operations management and how this is changing due to digital transformations and the implementation of DevOps. First, we looked at the roles and responsibilities of operations and the different operational service management processes. We also discussed some trends that will impact operations in the near future. The overall conclusion we attained is that the role of ops will change, mainly because of digital transformation and the implementation of agile and DevOps. To become agile, we need operators to be able to focus on their distinctive tasks. We then discussed a demarcation model with product ops and platform ops.</p>
			<p>Next, we learned how the architecture will change to become a more event-driven architecture and what the position of ops will be here. Ops will need to have a single pane of glass view, overseeing and even predicting events in the full chain so that proactive measures can be taken. This is what level 3 describes in the operations maturity model: proactive and predictable. AI and ML will help in this. </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will discuss the impact of AI in the enterprise and IT operations.</p>
