			<h1 id="_idParaDest-93"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor095"/>Chapter 8</em>: Architecting AIOps</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we will learn how <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence for IT operations</strong> (<strong class="bold">AIOps</strong>) platforms are designed and what sets them apart from any other monitoring tool. You will get a better understanding of why these platforms will become a necessity in the future of IT. The chapter starts by explaining the logical architecture model and then drills down to the key components in AIOps using data lakes and analysis through machine learning. We will define the reference architecture for an AIOps platform and learn how this will drive operations as we integrate the technical services architecture in AIOps. The chapter will provide insights into algorithms, anomaly detection, and auto-remediation. </p>
			<p>After completing this chapter, you will be able to recognize the various key components of AIOps and define the reference architecture. You will learn some important lessons in implementing AIOps in enterprises, avoiding some major pitfalls. </p>
			<p> In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding the logical architecture</li>
				<li>Defining the key components of AIOps architecture</li>
				<li>Integrating AIOps with service architecture</li>
				<li>Defining the reference architecture for AIOps</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-94"><a id="_idTextAnchor096"/>Understanding the logical architecture</h1>
			<p>Before we<a id="_idIndexMarker477"/> dig into the architecture of AIOps, we need to understand the structure of logical architecture. In the previous chapter (<a href="B17492_07_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor086"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Understanding the Impact of AI to DevOps</em>), we learned that one of the first steps to get started with the implementation of AIOPs is to get full visibility of all our IT assets and processes. This is a requirement to <em class="italic">feed</em> the AIOps model with the basic information of how the IT environment looks. Most AIOps tooling will scan the environment using agents, but that is not sufficient. It also needs to understand the relationship between assets and what process flows are implemented. That is covered in the logical architecture. </p>
			<p>The logical architecture is not about technology. It doesn't care what type of machines are used or what software. Logical architecture describes systems without the definition of the underlying technology. It describes the relationship between logical components in a system. The choice<a id="_idIndexMarker478"/> of a particular technology—infrastructure, software, code—is added later to this architecture. A logical architecture is meant to provide a comprehensible overview of the system as input for the technical design. Again, a logical architecture typically consists of layers, as shown in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer060" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_08_001.jpg" alt="Figure 8.1 – Components of a logical architecture&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.1 – Components of a logical architecture</p>
			<p>We will discuss these layers and the components in more detail later in this section.</p>
			<p>The logical architecture should be the starting point for any architecture. It holds every component that a system needs to fulfill its function. So, from the desired functionality, the architect must work out the different components that a system needs to be able to meet this functionality, without being bothered by constraints that inevitably will come with the choice of technology. The architect will need to think about the various system layers, the components in these layers, and the interaction between the layers. Next, they will also need to consider the interactions with other systems. </p>
			<p>Only when this logical model is completely worked out in every detail, the physical architecture can be defined, translating the logical components into technical components such as infrastructure with network devices and servers, operating systems, and finally, the technical application components, including the interfaces and APIs.   </p>
			<p>To help the architect in defining the logical architecture, it's recommended to work in tiers as shown in the previous figure. Tiers include client, access, presentation, application, worker (in some literature referred to as business), and data. It follows a common pattern that systems use to perform a transaction. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">A transaction doesn't have to be a financial transaction. In system architecture, a transaction refers to an action that a system performs, triggered by input and leading to a certain output, or a request leading to a response. Of course, this can be a real transaction, such as an ordering process. But a transaction could also be a message that is transferred to another system. </p>
			<p>How would the request-response<a id="_idIndexMarker479"/> cycle look when we break it down into separate steps?</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The user raises a request through the presentation tier.</li>
				<li>The user is authenticated through the access tier.</li>
				<li>After authentication, the request is transferred to the application tier.</li>
				<li>From the application tier, the request is processed through the worker tier.</li>
				<li>The required data is collected from the data tier.</li>
				<li>Data is processed through the worker tier.</li>
				<li>A response to the request is prepared in the worker tier and sent to the application tier.</li>
				<li>The response is transferred from the application tier to the presentation tier. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>The request-response flow is shown in the following figure:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer061" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_08_002.jpg" alt="Figure 8.2 – The request-response flow in a logical architecture&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.2 – The request-response flow in a logical architecture</p>
			<p>The circles represent<a id="_idIndexMarker480"/> the request and the triangles show the response flow. Now, let's look at the different components in more detail:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Client</strong>: This is the entry<a id="_idIndexMarker481"/> point for the user to start using an application. Typically, this is a browser or an applet on a device that allows the user to connect to applications. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Access</strong>: We don't want<a id="_idIndexMarker482"/> just anyone using systems, so users need to be authorized and authenticated. The access tier sits between the client and the presentation tier: users use the client to get to the presentation tier and are then authorized and authenticated in the access tier. After access is granted, the request is processed. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Presentation</strong>: The presentation<a id="_idIndexMarker483"/> tier has two main functions. First, it helps the user to put in the request in a comprehensible way. Once the request has been processed, the response is presented in this tier. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Application</strong>: This is the tier where the application<a id="_idIndexMarker484"/> technology is stored.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Worker</strong>: Sometimes this tier is referred to as the<a id="_idIndexMarker485"/> business tier, but that might be a bit<a id="_idIndexMarker486"/> confusing. This is the tier where the request is processed. Basically, this is the tier where the application functionality is stored. It holds all the components that enable an application to prepare a response to the user's request, including the APIs that, for instance, collect the required data and process that data. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data</strong>: This tier should only be used to store<a id="_idIndexMarker487"/> the data. The worker tier sits between this data tier and the presentation tier so that clients can never access data directly. They will always need to go through the worker tier. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is straightforward if it concerns one system, but enterprises have more systems. These systems connect to each other and might very well depend on other systems. If an enterprise has<a id="_idIndexMarker488"/> implemented <strong class="bold">single sign-on</strong> (<strong class="bold">SSO</strong>), a user might only have to go through an access tier once. But it's very likely that the request will follow a workflow through different worker tiers belonging to different systems. There might be data required that comes from various data sources. It's certainly not a given that the user gets the responses presented in just one presentation tier, although that might be very much desired from a user's perspective. If we think about that, the logical architecture becomes already quite complicated, let alone if the architect tries to get in all the technical details at this stage. </p>
			<p>AIOps works with this logical architecture. From this, it understands how systems are designed and what relationship they have to other systems. This is the basis for the reference architecture of AIOps. Before we get to that reference architecture, we will look at the different components of the AIOps architecture. This is the topic of the next section.   </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>Defining the key components of AIOps architecture</h1>
			<p>In this section, we will discuss the key components of AIOps. Then, we will look at the operating services that provide input for AIOps, and finally, in the last section, we will draft the reference architecture.</p>
			<p>First, let's recap<a id="_idIndexMarker489"/> why we should have AIOps in IT and specifically DevOps. IT has become more complicated. Systems are hosted on various platforms, connecting to other systems, using a lot of different data sources, with an equal amount of variety in data formats. We have come to the point where it has almost become impossible for a human to maintain an overview of these complex landscapes. Yet, the market is demanding new features at a rapidly increasing pace. Developers are under a lot of pressure to deliver code that fulfills new functionality, while operators need to make sure that systems are running stably. AIOps can help you do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Process and evaluate data</strong>: AIOps can rapidly, in almost real time, process data coming from different systems and validate this data. By doing this, AIOps <a id="_idIndexMarker490"/>can generate alerts and suggest mitigating actions to maintain the desired performance of systems. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Rapid root cause detection and analysis</strong>: Because AIOps has access to all that data and it understands how systems are interconnected, it will be able to get to the root cause of an issue much faster than operators. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enable automation</strong>: By processing and evaluating data, AIOps will recognize patterns. These patterns are translated into automation sequences, eliminating manual tasks. Also, AIOps will learn from these patterns by analyzing the outcomes of certain processes. If a pattern constantly leads to an undesired outcome, it will come up with suggested actions to change the pattern. Engineers will benefit from these suggestions. They will have to spend less time searching for issues in the systems and more time improving them.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Anomaly detection</strong>: Because AIOps learns patterns, it will also be able to recognize deviations in these patterns. These deviations might be anomalies: events<a id="_idIndexMarker491"/> that need attention. That could be a user trying to get access within minutes from two locations that are separated miles from one another to the unexpected trigger of an API from the CI/CD pipeline. AI therefore will also greatly benefit the security of systems, something that we will discuss further in the third part of this book, about DevSecOps.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Automated remediation</strong>: Sophisticated AIOps systems might be able to autonomously<a id="_idIndexMarker492"/> solve issues, since they have learned patterns and are able to detect anomalies. Since AIOps systems are highly automated, they can also learn how to execute remediating actions in the event of <em class="italic">known</em> issues, typically issues that have occurred in the past. AIOps will learn how these issues have been solved and in that case, the action can be automated. Be aware that the conditions of these issues need to be similar to the conditions when the issue first occurred.    </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Overall, AIOps will definitively increase the efficiency of IT and more particularly the DevOps cycle. Developers have started using AI to discover correlations and patterns in various systems, helping them to improve the code, including predictive analysis. It means asking the <em class="italic">what if</em> question repeatedly, only much faster and with a far better chance of getting more accurate answers.  </p>
			<p>To be able to do this, AIOps systems<a id="_idIndexMarker493"/> require several components:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Source repository and control</strong>: As with CI/CD in DevOps, all code has a source so that systems can always be restored from that source. All designs, patterns, configuration parameters, and application code, and all other IT artifacts, are kept in a source repository that is brought under version control.  This is the <em class="italic">baseline</em> for all systems. The<a id="_idIndexMarker494"/> <strong class="bold">Configuration Management Database</strong> (<strong class="bold">CMDB</strong>) that we discussed in <a href="B17492_07_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor086"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Understanding the Impact of AI on DevOps</em>, is part of this repository but will likely not hold application code. So, the full repository will contain various sources. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data Repository for Big Data</strong>: AIOps systems collect a lot of data from various sources that they analyze and use to train themselves, modeling the data into patterns to enable further automation. This data is collected in its original formats in distributed file structures, such as a data lake. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Monitoring</strong>: AIOps systems might use agents to track how systems perform and if connections between system and system components are available. Most systems, however, will aggregate data from other monitoring sources. In a public cloud, this could be Azure Monitor, AWS CloudWatch, or Google Cloud Monitoring, combined with other, specialized tools or vendor-specific tools to monitor specific components in the IT environment. AIOps will get the raw data from these tools and use this to train itself. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Automation</strong>: Automating<a id="_idIndexMarker495"/> repetitive tasks and for auto-remediation.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Machine Learning</strong>: This is the core of AIOps. From the source repository and the collected<a id="_idIndexMarker496"/> data, it will learn how systems behave and connect to other systems. AIOps will learn how applications and data in applications are used and how requests are processed. AIOps systems will use the big data, compare it to source repositories, and continuously learn from these analyses in order to automatically trace issues and come up with suggestions to mitigate or improve, providing feedback to developers and operators. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now we need to understand how these components work together. IT research and advisory company Gartner has defined a model for AIOps that consists of three domains:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Observe</strong>: This involves real-time tracking and tracing of all metrics across the systems. AIOps<a id="_idIndexMarker497"/> monitors performance, connections, and anomalies by correlating and analyzing data with historical data coming from source repositories.  </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Engage</strong>: This involves all data that is related to incidents and changes. The engage<a id="_idIndexMarker498"/> domain integrates <strong class="bold">IT service management</strong> (<strong class="bold">ITSM</strong>) processes<a id="_idIndexMarker499"/> with AIOps. This will be discussed in more detail in the next section.    </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Act</strong>: This involves the automation<a id="_idIndexMarker500"/> and any action that AIOps systems execute based on the monitoring data (observe) and the output of processes (engage). </li>
			</ul>
			<p>The model is presented as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer062" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_08_003.jpg" alt="Figure 8.3 – Three domains in AIOps (original by Gartner)&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.3 – Three domains in AIOps (original by Gartner)</p>
			<p>To be able to act, AIOps needs to understand and learn how IT services are delivered through the enterprise. We will discuss this in the next section, where we learn how technical service architecture is integrated with AIOps, driving operations in a more efficient way. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor098"/>Integrating AIOps with service architecture</h1>
			<p>So far, we have looked at the logical and different components of AIOps. One of the main reasons to bring AI into <a id="_idIndexMarker501"/>operations is to relieve operators of a lot of manual tasks by proactively monitoring<a id="_idIndexMarker502"/> systems and even mitigating possible risks before they actually materialize. In other words, AIOps is invented to reduce<a id="_idIndexMarker503"/> what <strong class="bold">Site Reliability Engineering</strong> (<strong class="bold">SRE</strong>) calls toil. That's the whole point of implementing DevOps and AIOps: to reduce toil and create time to continuously design and build better systems. </p>
			<p>But it's not only about the systems themselves. Enterprises also have processes to deliver services. That's the domain of the service architecture. Or, better and more precise: the technical service architecture. That includes the processes that are discussed in the following subsections.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor099"/>Monitoring</h2>
			<p>This is not something that simply comes out of the box. On the contrary, architects need to define a monitoring<a id="_idIndexMarker504"/> architecture including what business functions, applications, and underlying infrastructure must be monitored in order to get accurate and appropriate data about systems' conditions at the earliest stage possible. The next question is how monitoring can be automated: what thresholds must lead to actions, and can these actions be automated as well? What logs must be stored, where, and for how long? It's recommended to store logs automatically, as part of the big data that AIOps can use to train itself. Monitoring architecture next defines the routing of alerts: this is crucial input for AIOps platforms. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>Problem management</h2>
			<p>This starts<a id="_idIndexMarker505"/> with an incident, preferably detected through monitoring rather than a user reporting an issue to a service desk. Not every single incident will lead to a problem, though. A user who can't log in to a system because their credentials have expired might become an incident but rarely will lead to a root cause analysis and/or a problem. If incidents are severe, impacting parts of or even the whole business, then problem management needs to be executed. The same applies when similar incidents occur multiple times. Problem management is needed to analyze the cause and to determine whether there are correlating events<a id="_idIndexMarker506"/> and patterns. Problem management therefore requires a deep knowledge of systems and tools. With today's complexity of the enterprise IT landscape, the execution of problem management will inevitably lead to analyzing a vast amount of data coming from various systems. AIOps will help in analyzing this data, determine trends, and get to root causes faster. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor101"/>Configuration management</h2>
			<p>What is the desired state of a system? That is the main question<a id="_idIndexMarker507"/> in configuration<a id="_idIndexMarker508"/> management. <strong class="bold">Configuration items</strong> (<strong class="bold">CIs</strong>) are kept<a id="_idIndexMarker509"/> in a repository, including the status of their life cycle. CIs include every component that forms a system: network connections, servers, software, APIs, and policies. Each of these components must be configured as defined in the architecture to maintain consistency. </p>
			<p>Example: the architect decides that a Windows server always runs the version Windows Server 2019, but with specific settings that are captured in a server policy. They also decide that a database<a id="_idIndexMarker510"/> server always runs SQL or uses Azure SQL as a PaaS service. As part of the architecture, a database server is never allowed to communicate directly with the outside world, so the architecture will also have policies on how database servers will communicate with other servers, including firewall rules and connection strings. </p>
			<p>Configuration management<a id="_idIndexMarker511"/> needs to make sure that these configurations are kept during the entire life cycle of components, also when these components are migrated to different platforms or different stages in the promotion path (development, testing, acceptance, and production). For that reason, accurate configuration management is critical for ensuring system quality and good change management. Configuration management and desired state are the baseline input for AIOps. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor102"/>Change management</h2>
			<p>Whenever systems or components of systems are moved, updated, upgraded, altered, or decommissioned, change management<a id="_idIndexMarker512"/> is involved. In other words, change management does not only take care of the implementation of new systems. Any time a system is changed in whatever way, change management plays an important role. To enable change management, it needs a single source of truth<a id="_idIndexMarker513"/> in terms of CIs and the configuration of components – the desired state. It needs to rely on configuration management, accurate monitoring, and consistent reporting of events that have been logged from systems. In AIOps this is identified as historical data, to which it compares the changes and validates whether systems are still performing well in the desired state. Anomaly detection will help in identifying issues as changes are implemented. </p>
			<p>All these processes discussed so far result in data, stored in tickets that are raised by users or preferably events logged by systems. In the model that we discussed in the previous section about defining the key components for AIOps architecture, Gartner refers to this type of data as engagement data. </p>
			<p>Engagement data is used for the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Task automation</li>
				<li>Change risk analysis</li>
				<li>Performance analysis</li>
				<li>Knowledge management</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Engagement means<a id="_idIndexMarker514"/> that ITSM communicates<a id="_idIndexMarker515"/> with operational data that is derived from monitoring, events, and system metrics. All this data is aggregated in one repository, a big data platform so that the AIOps system has one data library with which it can analyze system health and performance. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/>Big data in AIOps</h2>
			<p>This big data<a id="_idIndexMarker516"/> platform is the heart of AIOps: it will<a id="_idIndexMarker517"/> capture data from different systems without the silos these systems are in. What do we mean by that? A system can have components in a privately owned data center and communicate with PaaS or SaaS services in a public cloud. To get an integrated view of the entire system, AIOps needs to have access to one, aggregated data source – the big data platform. That platform will hold historical data, data on iterations of the system, and real-time system data using interactive big data analytics. </p>
			<p>Recapping, AIOps platforms have operational data and process data: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Data originating from many different systems</li>
				<li>Capabilities to analyze streaming, real-time data, and historical data</li>
				<li>Process data from events, logs, alerts, and root cause analysis</li>
				<li>Capabilities to integrate process IT workflows and correlating them with operational system data</li>
				<li>Capabilities to visualize data in a comprehensible way</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following figure shows the AIOps stack:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer063" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.4 – High-level modeling of the AIOps stack</p>
			<p>We have <a id="_idIndexMarker518"/>extensively covered the domains observe and engage in the Gartner model. Based <a id="_idIndexMarker519"/>on the data and the services patterns AIOps can now start executing activities, the final stage in AIOps. It can automate tasks by using runbooks and scripts. The final step is to translate the components in an architecture for an AIOps platform. In the last section, we will define a reference architecture, putting it all together. Lastly, we will provide some tools that will get you started with AIOps.  </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-102"><a id="_idTextAnchor104"/>Defining the reference architecture for AIOps</h1>
			<p>In the previous sections, we studied the logical architecture of systems, the components of AIOps, and the technical service<a id="_idIndexMarker520"/> architecture. All these building<a id="_idIndexMarker521"/> blocks are used to define the architecture for AIOps. In this section, we will look at the reference architecture for AIOps. </p>
			<p>First, let's recap the goal of AIOps. In <a href="B17492_07_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor086"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Understanding the Impact of AI to DevOps</em>, we discussed<a id="_idIndexMarker522"/> the <strong class="bold">Key Performance Indicators</strong> (<strong class="bold">KPIs</strong>) for AIOps: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Mean Time to Detect</strong> (<strong class="bold">MTTD</strong>)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Mean Time to Acknowledge</strong> (<strong class="bold">MTTA</strong>)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Mean Time to Resolve</strong> (<strong class="bold">MTTR</strong>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>AIOps adds artificial<a id="_idIndexMarker523"/> intelligence<a id="_idIndexMarker524"/> to IT<a id="_idIndexMarker525"/> operations, using big data analytics and<a id="_idIndexMarker526"/> <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>). The AIOps system collects and aggregates data from various systems and tools, in order to detect issues and anomalies fast, comparing real-time data with historical data that reflect the original desired state of systems. Through ML it learns how to mitigate issues by automated actions. Eventually, it will learn how to predict events and avoid them from impacting systems. </p>
			<p>To enable this, AIOps works with predictive alerts based on algorithms and anomaly detection. It <em class="italic">knows</em> how systems should react and respond and how systems interact with other systems. Deviations are quickly discovered, analyzed, and validated: are these deviations in the range of normal behavior or are they outside that range? What could be the consequence if a system<a id="_idIndexMarker527"/> is showing anomalies? </p>
			<p>AIOps can only value these events<a id="_idIndexMarker528"/> if it's provided with data: system data and process data, such as requests and data on incidents and problems that have occurred. It needs that data to learn and adapt the algorithms, so it becomes more accurate over time.</p>
			<p>In the previous section, we learned about the three domains in AIOps: observe, engage, and act. Now we need to translate this into a reference architecture. We can do so by creating four layers to perform operational tasks. This is shown in the following figure:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer064" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_08_005.jpg" alt="Figure 8.5 – Logical reference architecture for AIOps&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.5 – Logical reference architecture for AIOps</p>
			<p>These four layers contain various components, just as we saw in the logical architecture of systems that we discussed in the <em class="italic">Defining the key components for AIOps architecture</em> section of this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Collect</li>
				<li>Organize</li>
				<li>Analyze</li>
				<li>Act</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The process<a id="_idIndexMarker529"/> starts with the different services as input: requests, incidents, problems, and changes. In the previous section, we learned that this is included in engagement<a id="_idIndexMarker530"/> data. AIOps systems will now perform several steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Collect is<a id="_idIndexMarker531"/> the first step <a id="_idIndexMarker532"/>that an AIOps system will perform: it will collect observations and the engagement data from as many sources as available: system metrics, events, logs, and even information from tickets that are raised by a service desk. All this data is sent to a data lake, the main repository of the AIOps system.  </li>
				<li>The data lake will hold raw data: the source data as it is retrieved from systems and monitoring tools. The original data formats will be kept intact. The next step, therefore, is to organize that data. Remember that accuracy increases as AIOps has access to as much data as possible. The outcomes of AI analyses are more reliable as more data sources are added to and integrated with the data lake. That comes with a challenge: raw data will contain noise. It's important that this imported data is cleaned.   <p>An important<a id="_idIndexMarker533"/> lesson in<a id="_idIndexMarker534"/> data science is garbage in, garbage out. To allow AI to come up with accurate advice and <em class="italic">learn</em> with the right data, we need to make sure that it only uses proper datasets. Data models need to be trained as well. This will take some time: the system needs to be told what good data is and what it can be used for. This way, algorithms become more accurate over time.  </p><p>An example will make things clear. Monitoring will collect data from the CPU in a server. That CPU might have peaks of 90 percent, but overall, the usage will be around 20 percent. AIOps will need to learn that a value between, for instance, 20 and 40 percent is normal. It will also need to learn that a peak of 90 percent is OK if it's for a very short time and that it doesn't have to create an alarm for that. Now, the model can filter event and log data based on these parameters and identify systems that are running above that threshold. That's indeed something that regular monitoring systems already do, but AIOps will be able to correlate anomalies in CPU performance with other events. And it will be able to initiate remediating actions automatically.   </p></li>
				<li>Raw and cleaned, structured data is used to train the AI models, using machine and deep learning. </li>
				<li>Real-time data is compared with historical data such as original configurations, executed changes, and passed events. By constantly comparing this data, the AIOps systems learn and will even be able to present a timeline of events. This allows operators in some cases to <em class="italic">time travel</em> through a series of events, investigating when and why a system state changed. </li>
				<li>The final <a id="_idIndexMarker535"/>step is act. Trained AI models will send predictive alerts and start mitigating actions, based on the learning of previous events and actions that have been <a id="_idIndexMarker536"/>taken when a specific event occurred. Obviously, all alerts and actions are looped back as data into the data lake. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>We are ready to start the implementation of an AIOps platform. In the next section, we will discuss the approach to a successful implementation and also identify some potential pitfalls. In the last section, we will give a short overview of some popular tools.  </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/>Successfully implementing AIOps</h2>
			<p>AIOps is still a rather new phenomenon in IT operations and implementing AIOps platforms can be very complicated. However, with the following steps in mind, it should be doable to perform<a id="_idIndexMarker537"/> a successful implementation. The first and probably the most important lesson is to start small, as with DevOps and SRE. </p>
			<p>Before you start, you need a plan. Identify which systems would suit a pilot. Pick a system with a basic architecture: an application with just a website as the frontend, the application itself, and a database. Validate whether all assets belonging to this application are documented well and are identified in the CMDB. Next, ensure that you have a good – documented – understanding of workflows and processes that are related to this application. </p>
			<p>Why is this important? The AIOps platform, but also engineers – operators – need to learn how to work with AI, ML, and analytics. What do operators want to get out of the platform? What type of alerts? And is it clear what they should do with the alerts or how they can use AIOps to analyze the alerts and help it in automating actions? Operators will need to learn what type of data the AIOps system needs, so they will need to learn about data requirements, data flows, storing data in data lakes, and modeling data analytics. This will definitely take time. </p>
			<p>Now the AIOps system can be further configured, and more components of the IT landscape can be added, making sure that the system learns from the different use cases. It is highly recommended to run the platform in test mode for the first weeks or even up to 2 months, allowing AIOps to learn. Once operators are satisfied with the functionality and the outcomes of analysis, it can be pushed to run in production. But you should always validate outcomes with the original system metrics and the goals that were set to implement<a id="_idIndexMarker538"/> AIOps. The simple question is: have these goals been met in the testing phase? If the goal was to speed up the time needed to define the root cause of an incident, then that goal should be measurable and compared to the original metric. To put it differently: any implementation of a system must have a valid business case. </p>
			<p>So, the first step is capturing operations data: logs and metrics from infrastructure components, applications, databases, and APIs. Next, we need data from workflows and also business processes. We might also need other relational data, for instance, data about sales and market sentiments, "predicting" when certain services are popular in specific periods and under what conditions. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Use case</p>
			<p class="callout">An international operating railway company implemented AIOps a few years ago. Their infrastructure was built on various platforms, including<a id="_idIndexMarker539"/> AWS and Google Cloud, using a lot of different tools for monitoring and development. The lack of real-time visibility of the systems on these platforms and their dependencies slowed down developments, but also caused heavy delays in root cause analysis. This caused some major outages, impacting travelers. By bringing data together from the various platforms and integrating monitoring tools such as AWS CloudWatch and Google Analytics, the company was able to have an integrated view of all the correlated systems. AIOps tooling was implemented to analyze incidents in real time using this data, resulting in significantly lower MTTD and MTTR. </p>
			<p>The use case shows that the more data we can get, the more accurate our AIOps platform will be. This data will tell how events correlate and eventually ensure that AIOps understands the root causes of these events. From this point onwards, you can train the platform on resolutions using real-time observations through monitoring and creating automated responses.  </p>
			<p>One crucial step in<a id="_idIndexMarker540"/> implementing AIOps platforms is to really involve operators. They are and will be very important to get real value out of the platform. In other words, AI is not about replacing operators – on the contrary. The system will enable them to get rid of tedious, repetitive, usually manual tasks – remember <em class="italic">toil</em> in SRE – and allow them to focus on other, more challenging tasks that are required to develop, test, and launch new systems.</p>
			<p>Not involving the operators is only one of the pitfalls. In the next section, we will briefly highlight some other potential pitfalls.     </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor106"/>Avoiding pitfalls in AIOps</h2>
			<p>Besides not involving operators during the implementation of an AIOps platform, there are three major pitfalls<a id="_idIndexMarker541"/> that must be avoided:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Not enough data</strong>: With only a limited dataset, the AIOps platform will not perform. The system can never be accurate without enough data. Findings, issues, events, and anomalies will not or will only occasionally be detected and that will make the system unreliable, generating false positives or even mitigating issues that it doesn't need to solve.  </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Wrong or irrelevant data</strong>: This might be even worse than not having enough data. Wrong data will definitively lead to false outcomes and unexpected or unwanted actions. In order to learn in the correct way, AI needs enough and valid data. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data silos</strong>: AIOps platforms get their data from multiple systems. AIOps, however, needs this data to be available from one source to enable data analytics. Operational data, application performance data, data on connectivity, and security data: it needs to be collected and aggregated to one source to make the system fast and efficient at creating valuable datasets. In other words, the data silos need to be broken down.  </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Summarizing, AIOps needs enough data, relevant data, and for it to be stored in one repository so it can create valuable datasets for operational analytics. By now, you should realize that AIOps systems are complex, but there is a growing number of tools that can help you to get started. We will list some of these tools in the final section of this chapter. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor107"/>Popular tools in AIOps</h2>
			<p>Lastly, we will provide<a id="_idIndexMarker542"/> some tools that will get you started with AIOps. The AIOps landscape has grown tremendously in recent years. Take a look at the Periodic Table of DevOps tools in the following figure: the category of AIOps was only added very recently, already listing a significant number of tools, such as Splunk, Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic, and the Elastic ELK Stack:</p>

			<p>It's not easy<a id="_idIndexMarker543"/> to select the right tools. The reason for that is that these tools differ very much from each other. It depends on the angle that the enterprise takes to evaluate the proper tools and toolsets. Things to consider are the following:  </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Tools that focus more on application and application performance management, rather than infrastructure components </li>
				<li>SaaS or on-premises tools</li>
				<li>Native AI and ML or tools that require extensions</li>
				<li>Data-driven<a id="_idIndexMarker544"/> AI or AI that is also context-aware<p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">Gartner publishes a magic quadrant<a id="_idIndexMarker545"/> every year to identify the leaders and promising newcomers in this emerging market. The report can be downloaded from Gartner's website at <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/4000217/market-guide-for-aiops-platforms">https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/4000217/market-guide-for-aiops-platforms</a>. Be aware that you or your employer will need to become a client to be able to download content from the Gartner site.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Obviously, more sophisticated tools will come at a price. The most important question an enterprise must ask itself is what it wants to get out of AIOps. That will drive the business case and possibly justify the investment. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-106"><a id="_idTextAnchor108"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This chapter was a deep dive into AIOps. This is a rather new domain, but very promising. We've learned how AIOps platforms are built and learn as they are implemented in enterprises. It's important to understand that you need a logical architecture to have a complete overview of how systems fulfill functionality and how they are related to other systems, without already knowing the full technical details of these systems. </p>
			<p>Next, we defined the key components of AIOps, being big data and machine or deep learning. AI only performs if it has access to enough relevant data on which it can execute analytic models. These models will teach the platform how to detect issues, anomalies, and other events, predict the impact on the IT landscape, find root causes faster, and eventually trigger actions. These actions can be automated. AIOps platforms will avoid a lot of tedious, repetitive work for operators, something that is called toil in SRE.</p>
			<p>We've learned what the reference architecture of AIOps looks like and how an enterprise can successfully implement the system. In the last paragraph, we looked briefly at some popular tools in the field. </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will learn how to integrate AIOps into DevOps. </p>
