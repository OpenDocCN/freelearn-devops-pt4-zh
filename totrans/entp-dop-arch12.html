			<h1 id="_idParaDest-120"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>Chapter 10</em>: Making the Final Step to NoOps</h1>
			<p>Is it possible to execute IT operations without hands-on operations? Research and advisory companies, such as Gartner and Forrester, foresee an IT future based on NoOps. The big idea behind NoOps is that literally everything can be automated. It means an even bigger role for AI, and something called <strong class="bold">heuristic automation</strong>. How can an enterprise move to NoOps, and what is the role of an architect in this field? We will discuss this in this chapter.</p>
			<p>After completing this chapter, you will be able to explain NoOps as a concept and why enterprises should adopt the principles of NoOps. You will learn what heuristic automation is and how it's driving the architecture of NoOps. The most important lesson that you will learn is that NoOps is not simply about having no need for any operations at all.  </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding the paradigm shift to NoOps</li>
				<li>Understanding the role of AI in NoOps</li>
				<li>Creating an architecture for heuristic automation</li>
				<li>Defining the roadmap to NoOps</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>Understanding the paradigm shift to NoOps</h1>
			<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker574"/> previous chapters, we discussed <a id="_idIndexMarker575"/>the <a id="_idIndexMarker576"/>introduction of <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>) and <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) into operations and development. In <a href="B17492_09_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor111"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Integrating AIOps in DevOps</em>, we learned how an enterprise can leverage AI and ML in DevOps pipelines. The reason to do this is to make a lot of manual tasks obsolete through intelligent automation. NoOps takes all of this one step further: automate IT systems completely so there's no need for operators to manually intervene in the systems. How far away are we from that paradigm shift? In addition, <em class="italic">is it realistic?</em> We will discuss that in this section. </p>
			<p>To answer the last question: NoOps seems to be more of an ideal than a real practice. The discussion around NoOps was initiated through the idea that teams could actually automate a lot of processes in development, especially regarding the deployment of applications. This started with<a id="_idIndexMarker577"/> services being provided as <strong class="bold">Software as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>) propositions, meaning an enterprise didn't need to worry about maintaining the services anymore. Updates and upgrades in SaaS and <strong class="bold">Platform as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">PaaS</strong>) were<a id="_idIndexMarker578"/> taken care of by the provider. Getting software and maintaining applications became as easy as working with a smartphone: at night you put your phone away, the manufacturer of the phone updates your phone, and when the phone is started again in the morning, all of the applications still work. In reality, for this to happen, a lot of actions must be executed in the background. In other words, NoOps might be superficial. </p>
			<p>However, the idea of NoOps does deserve some credit. It's in line with the principles of DevOps and automating as much as possible in the development, deployment, and operation of code. According to Deloitte, NoOps was a logical evolution in automating IT tasks and shifting activities from operations to development, focusing on business outcomes. That's <a id="_idIndexMarker579"/>nothing new. DevOps and especially <strong class="bold">Site Reliability Engineering</strong> (<strong class="bold">SRE</strong>) have <a id="_idIndexMarker580"/>these as basic principles. </p>
			<p>To be clear, NoOps is not the same as automated infrastructure provisioning. NoOps is about automated management of the full stack – applications, middleware, databases, and infrastructure. In terms of infrastructure, the concept of NoOps relies on infrastructure components that can be coded and controlled by code. Virtual machines might be an option, but these are still not very flexible in terms of automation of operations. Containers, and especially serverless solutions, are more logical. </p>
			<p>We can automate coding, provisioning of infrastructure, deployment of APIs, and configurations. We can add technology that will detect issues and anomalies fast, and maybe even have systems automatically remediate these based on predefined policies. We might be able to automate one application completely, but the reality is that today's enterprise IT consists of complex ecosystems, within and outside the enterprise. This will make it hard, if not impossible, to really have NoOps in practice. On the contrary, operations are getting more complex. But then again, NoOps is not about getting rid of operations completely. </p>
			<p>NoOps should be perceived as a concept and guidance in leveraging automation, saving costs, and speeding up developments, while also keeping systems stable, resilient, and unhindered by manual operational actions. NoOps will help architects with shift-left principles, injecting AI into operations, and also help in automating IT. We will explore shift-left and<a id="_idIndexMarker581"/> AI-enabled operations further in the next sections.    </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>Understanding the role of AI in NoOps</h1>
			<p>In the previous<a id="_idIndexMarker582"/> section, we discussed whether NoOps provides a realistic way of operating for future enterprises. We've concluded that NoOps should be seen as both a concept and a way of thinking to leverage automation for operations. It's not about getting rid of operations as a whole – IT environments in enterprises have become too complex for that. Still, they have the challenge of using their IT talents in the most optimized way. </p>
			<p>IT talent is becoming scarce, since the market demand for skilled and trained engineers is increasing at high speed. Because of this scarcity, the costs of staff are also increasing. To keep costs down and still be able to work as agile as possible, enterprise architects will have to search for other ways to operate IT. IT talent can then fully focus on developments. </p>
			<p>However, operations will be needed. We need people to look after systems, and make sure that these systems are running stably. You can't leave it all to machines. For that reason, it's good to narrow the definition of NoOps down a little bit. We can define NoOps as the stage where dedicated operators are no longer required to manage IT. It would then be a logical step in the evolution of enterprise DevOps, where teams operate as one in development, deployment, and operations. </p>
			<p>There are two things that will play an important role to get this stage:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Adopting shift-left</strong>: In <a href="B17492_07_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor086"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Understanding the Impact of AI on DevOps</em>, we concluded that shift-left is also applicable to both deployment and operations in DevOps. With automated templates, pre-approved patterns, and processes, we can start testing in an early stage of development and deploy consistent, stable code to the next stages (including production). It will certainly lead to less work for operations. <p>Operators will typically define how production is monitored, whereas developers control this themselves in <em class="italic">sandboxes</em>, development, and testing environments. In NoOps, this is shifted to the very beginning of the whole cycle – the DevOps teams decide how code is tested and monitored. The team is end-to-end responsible. The distinction between operators and developers becomes obsolete.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Artificial intelligence and machine learning</strong>: As we've seen with AIOps, AI and ML will help in detecting issues quickly, and can even be trained to give recommendations or initiate actions such as these: <p>- <strong class="bold">Automated software life cycle management</strong>: AI will help in recognizing when software needs to be updated and will take care of the update process, keeping<a id="_idIndexMarker583"/> the services that run on the software operational and stable. Think of the smartphone analogy in the first section. The phone is updated, and when the user switches it back on, all functionality will normally be there again. This is enabled by the fact that the phone <em class="italic">knows</em> the dependencies in different apps, along with the underlying protocols and code. It uses AI for this.</p><p>- <strong class="bold">Automated remediation</strong>: AI can trigger automated actions to fix issues even before the issue materializes. Predictive maintenance is enabled.  </p><p>- <strong class="bold">Auto-healing</strong>: When an unexpected issue occurs, AI will detect it, know how to solve it from history or by learning, and eventually apply the fix. The process of solving the problem is referred to as auto-healing. Be aware that all these actions – life cycle management, remediation, and healing – need to be logged so every change is traceable. </p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, we have discussed automation in DevOps, introduced AI in DevOps, and also discussed leveraging automation even further in NoOps. The foundation under this level of automation is heuristic automation. In the next section, we will study architecture for heuristic automation. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>Creating an architecture for heuristic automation</h1>
			<p>First, let's get a <a id="_idIndexMarker584"/>definition of heuristic: in the literature, it is referred to as applying a solution to an issue without the aim of being the optimal solution, but sufficient to fix the immediate problem that was discovered. <em class="italic">Trial and error</em> would certainly match this definition. The Hungarian mathematician George Pólya used the term in his book, <em class="italic">How to Solve It</em>, first published in 1945. He provided some practical ways of solving problems. </p>
			<p>One of his principles is commonly used in architecture applying ML: if you don't have a solution, assume that you have a solution and see what it does. Keep the good stuff and analyze the bits that didn't work well. Try the iterated solution again and learn from it. This is the base of heuristic automation. It uses heuristic learning that can be leveraged through AI that is able to recognize and learn from patterns. AI will use algorithms and automation – it constantly learns and adapts the analytics, up until the point where the solution is optimized.</p>
			<p>First, we will need to understand the principle of learning. AI and ML in automation typically use deduction. This is shown in the following figure. There are more learning principles, such as induction and abduction, but these do not really add value to the goal of automation:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer074" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_10_001.jpg" alt="Figure 10.1 – Principle of deduction in ML&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.1 – Principle of deduction in ML</p>
			<p>With deduction, the system will analyze an event by observing and comparing it with previous experiences, examples, and common theories. Based on that analysis, it will reach a conclusion. A rule base will tell the system what to do next. Obviously, this rule base is dynamic, since the system will add things it has learned to the rule base. </p>
			<p>With that in mind, we can define <a id="_idIndexMarker585"/>the components for heuristic automation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Event sources</strong>: Aggregating data from events throughout systems and system components.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data on patterns and correlations</strong>: Repository with known patterns and correlations between systems.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Analytics engine</strong>: Algorithms and rules enabling analytics and the prediction of outcomes.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Analytics processes</strong>: The processes that tell the system what to do if anomalies are detected, and what solutions should be applied from the rule base.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Dynamic rule base</strong>: Possible solutions based on induction patterns. This is a dynamic process, since solutions will continuously be improved. Based on the findings, the solutions are updated. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>The logical <a id="_idIndexMarker586"/>architecture for heuristic automation is shown in the following figure: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer075" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_10_002.jpg" alt="Figure 10.2 – Logical architecture for heuristic automation&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.2 – Logical architecture for heuristic automation</p>
			<p>Heuristic<a id="_idIndexMarker587"/> automation will enable the enterprise to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify and solve issues without human intervention through the automated analysis of complex systems.</li>
				<li>Recognize, identify, and understand relationships between systems and predict the impact of issues.</li>
				<li>Solve issues through ML using various data sources and real-time analytics.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We stress once more that NoOps and heuristic automation by no means intends to replace operators. It will help them in solving issues faster, as well as helping businesses with more stable and resilient systems. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-124"><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>Defining the roadmap to NoOps</h1>
			<p>NoOps is not a leap<a id="_idIndexMarker588"/> of faith. As with DevOps and AIOps, any next step requires a plan and a roadmap. Using the principles of heuristic automation and AIOps, we can leverage automation for intelligent automation, collaborating with cloud-native automation, and automated application deployment in CI/CD pipelines. </p>
			<p>The following figure shows how NoOps consists of three major components. These three components are the roadmap to get to a level of automation where dedicated operations are no longer required. DevOps teams are end-to-end responsible for the development, deployment, running, and maintenance of the code, supported by fully automated<a id="_idIndexMarker589"/> processes and AI:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer076" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_10_003.jpg" alt="Figure 10.3 – Components of NoOps&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.3 – Components of NoOps</p>
			<p>The end state is predictive automation using predictive analytics that analyzes current data to eventually make predictions for the future. It includes the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Scaling for future needs, for instance by analyzing usage of software, predicting future use, and actioning this in scaling the systems</li>
				<li>Foreseeing business trends and preparing systems for this, including preparing code by collecting and analyzing requirements</li>
				<li>Code suggestions for improving code, fulfilling predicted future needs</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A very simplified roadmap to NoOps could look like the following figure:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer077" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_10_004.jpg" alt="Figure 10.4 – Simplified representation of NoOps roadmap&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.4 – Simplified representation of NoOps roadmap</p>
			<p>Adopting NoOps requires both the right mindset and full support from the enterprise's management. Management <a id="_idIndexMarker590"/>will need to learn to trust automation. Only when this trust is established will they be willing to invest in the right tools. This will take time, and that timeline needs to be realistic, as reflected in the roadmap. Lastly, be prepared for pushback and setbacks. NoOps and full automation are more about adoption than technology, and adoption is a process. </p>
			<p>Is NoOps a leap of faith? Could there be automation without human intervention? Think of this: already in 2018, the Open Road project has been defined, studying the possibilities for computers to design their own new generation of chips. In June 2021, the science magazine Nature published an article stating that computers no longer need humans to design new chips. Using AI, computers can design chips in a matter of hours, whereas humans would need months for the same outcome. The foundation technology that was used for this was ML, and the use of cloud-native analytics tools in Google Cloud to run parallel sessions and achieve predictability in the outcomes of the design.   </p>
			<p>In this part of the book, we extensively discussed the approach for DevOps, SRE, and AIOps. All of these methodologies leverage automation in development and operations, to the point that human intervention might become obsolete. The subsequent question, then – is this safe? Can we really leave IT to automation and AI? How secure will our systems then be? We need to map our DevOps strategy to security standards, including industry security frameworks and enterprise proprietary security policies. These need to<a id="_idIndexMarker591"/> be embedded in DevOps. This is the domain of DevSecOps. In the third part of this book, we will discuss this further. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we discussed the concept of NoOps – no operations. We discovered that the term might be misleading, since NoOps doesn't mean that the enterprise will no longer need operations at all. NoOps is a concept that leverages automation to its maximum potential. By automating development, deployment, and operations, scarce IT talent can focus on new features, since NoOps will help them by identifying and solving issues in IT systems fast. We've learned that NoOps (like AIOps) uses AI and ML. But NoOps also means that enterprises will need to embrace the shift-left mentality.</p>
			<p>We've also learned that NoOps requires a specific type of architecture for heuristic automation: applying iterative solutions, learning from these solutions, and continuously improving them. We also discussed the different components of heuristic automation. In the final section, we explored a possible roadmap from DevOps to NoOps. We concluded that we already have the technology available, but that enterprises will need to adopt it to really leverage full automation and, with that, the concept of NoOps.  </p>
			<p>In the next part of this book, we will examine an important topic related to enterprise DevOps – security. We will learn how to integrate security with DevOps in DevSecOps. </p>
