			<h1 id="_idParaDest-157"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor159"/>Chapter 13</em>: Working with DevSecOps Using Industry Security Frameworks</h1>
			<p>An important artifact in security – and DevSecOps – is security frameworks. There are generic frameworks, such as <strong class="bold">Center for Internet Security</strong> (<strong class="bold">CIS</strong>), but typically, industries must comply with<a id="_idIndexMarker737"/> and report about compliancy according to specific industry security standards. These have an impact on the way security is handled within enterprises and therefore in the implementation of DevSecOps. </p>
			<p>This chapter will explain the functionality and impact of frameworks and how to incorporate them into DevSecOps. This chapter includes a separate paragraph on the use and value of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework since it is becoming more well-known and more widely accepted as a base framework. </p>
			<p>After completing this chapter, you will have a good understanding of the most used security frameworks and how the controls of these frameworks can be applied to DevOps. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding industry security frameworks</li>
				<li>Working with the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework</li>
				<li>Applying frameworks to DevSecOps</li>
				<li>Creating compliance reports and guiding audits</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-158"><a id="_idTextAnchor160"/>Understanding industry security frameworks</h1>
			<p>IT has become more<a id="_idIndexMarker738"/> complex over the years. The same applies to IT security. There's a correlation between the two. Enterprise IT environments are no longer monolithic systems that sit in the basement of a company that's functioning as the enterprise's data center. Today, IT environments share different components and have connections to the outside world through internet connections. With that notion, systems are, <em class="italic">by default</em>, accessible through the internet. Yet, only authorized users should be able to access these systems. Hence, we need some strong defenses to protect systems from security breaches. </p>
			<p>The level of <a id="_idIndexMarker739"/>required security will differ per industry. First of all, financial institutions will want to make sure that bank accounts can't be compromised and that money is not being illegally transferred. Healthcare institutions need to protect their patients' personal and health data. Manufacturers want to protect their intellectual property and patents. Above all, there are several overarching principles in terms of security, protecting data, identities, and hardening systems from outside attacks. It's almost impossible to keep track of all this, and that's where security frameworks come in: they provide guidance for implementing the right set of security policies in an enterprise. </p>
			<p>Before we learn how security frameworks impact CI/CD and DevOps, we will need to understand what these frameworks are. In short, a framework is a set of policies and documented guidelines on implementing and managing these policies. The policies themselves are focusing on identifying risks, mitigating risks, and reducing the attack surface of systems and procedures in case vulnerabilities are detected. This is a generic approach, but industry frameworks tune this approach to specific needs in an industry. </p>
			<p>Generic IT security frameworks include ISO IEC 27001/ISO 2700212, the <strong class="bold">National Institute of Standards and Technology</strong> (<strong class="bold">NIST</strong>) Cybersecurity Framework, <strong class="bold">Center for Internet Security </strong>(<strong class="bold">CIS</strong>), and <strong class="bold">Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies</strong> (<strong class="bold">COBIT</strong>). Let's explore these in a bit more detail first:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">ISO IEC 27001/ISO 2700212/27017</strong>: ISO 27001 <a id="_idIndexMarker740"/>is setting international<a id="_idIndexMarker741"/> standards for system security controls. The emphasis is on controls that detect threats that will have a severe impact on the availability and integrity of systems. ISO 27002 sets additional standards to manage the controls themselves, such as user access management and maintaining asset inventories. ISO 27017 specifically targets the cloud. It deals with shared responsibilities<a id="_idIndexMarker742"/> in <strong class="bold">Platform-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">PaaS</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Software-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>) environments, secures deployments <a id="_idIndexMarker743"/>and removes cloud systems, and monitors cloud services, as a few examples. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">NIST</strong>: The NIST <a id="_idIndexMarker744"/>Cybersecurity Framework doesn't specify controls, but it does provide five functions to enhance security: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. These<a id="_idIndexMarker745"/> functions allow organizations to set<a id="_idIndexMarker746"/> controls to manage data breach risks. Controls must include access control, measures to protect data, and also the awareness of staff. Respond calls for controls must describe how organizations should react to threats and attacks, including mitigation and communication guidelines. Recovery is the last resort: organizations need to have a clear strategy regarding how to recover from attacks, such as system and data recovery. The five NIST domains are shown in the following diagram:</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer091" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_13_001.jpg" alt="Figure 13.1 – The NIST cybersecurity framework&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.1 – The NIST cybersecurity framework</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">CIS</strong>: CIS <a id="_idIndexMarker747"/>offers extensive frameworks with specific<a id="_idIndexMarker748"/> controls for platforms, operating systems, databases, and containers. Some of the CIS frameworks are embedded in platforms such as CIS for Azure and AWS. In these scenarios, the CIS benchmarks can be accessed from Azure Security Center and AWS Security Hub. The CIS benchmarks make sure that used components are <em class="italic">hardened</em>. The big difference compared to NIST is that NIST focuses on guidelines to assess risks, whereas CIS provides long lists of security controls and best practices.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">COBIT</strong>: COBIT was <a id="_idIndexMarker749"/>launched by <strong class="bold">Information Systems Audit and Control Association</strong> (<strong class="bold">ISACA</strong>), the international organization of IT security and audits. Originally, COBIT was <a id="_idIndexMarker750"/>about identifying and mitigating technical risks in IT systems, but with the recent release of the framework – COBIT 5 – it also covers business risks that are related <a id="_idIndexMarker751"/>to IT. COBIT is complicated to implement and manage since it covers the entire enterprise, including all IT management processes such as incident, problem, configuration, and change management.  </li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are control frameworks. All of these frameworks may have <em class="italic">editions</em> that cover specific industry requirements, but typically, industries have to adhere to their <em class="italic">own</em> standards, as well as be fully compliant. This is important when industries are audited. In the last section of this chapter, we will discuss auditing in more detail.  </p>
			<p>The major industry <a id="_idIndexMarker752"/>frameworks – actually, these are regulatory attestations – are <strong class="bold">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">HIPAA</strong>) for healthcare, <strong class="bold">Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program</strong> (<strong class="bold">FedRAMP</strong>) for governmental organizations<a id="_idIndexMarker753"/> in the US, <strong class="bold">General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong class="bold">GDPR</strong>) in <a id="_idIndexMarker754"/>the European Union, and <strong class="bold">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard</strong> (<strong class="bold">PCI-DSS</strong>) for <a id="_idIndexMarker755"/>financial institutions. </p>
			<p>All of these are global or at least regionally implemented, but there may also be specific national security regulations a company needs to apply. An example is the <strong class="bold">New York Department of Financial Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">NYDFS</strong>) Cybersecurity <a id="_idIndexMarker756"/>Regulation. This framework was released in 2017, placing security regulations on all financial institutions in the US. However, the rules in this framework are aligned with NIST and apply ISO 27001 standards. Yet, NYDSF does have some rules that supersede these generic frameworks. Under NYDSF, data encryption and enhanced multi-factor authentication are mandatory security controls for all inbound connections.  </p>
			<p>There's one framework that we haven't discuss yet and that's MITRE ATT&amp;CK. MITRE ATT&amp;CK is not a real framework, such as the ones that we discussed in this section. It's a knowledge base that covers tactics on how systems might be attacked and breached. It can, however, be used as input to define risk strategies and threat models to protect systems. In the next section, we will learn how to use MITRE ATT&amp;CK.  </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-159"><a id="_idTextAnchor161"/>Working with the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework</h1>
			<p>Maybe it's not<a id="_idIndexMarker757"/> a completely fair statement, but we will post it here regardless: MITRE ATT&amp;CK lets you think from the attacker's perspective when it comes to security. The strength of this framework is that anyone can contribute to it. It doesn't really describe the actual vulnerabilities in systems, but more the techniques attackers could use to exploit these vulnerabilities. MITRE ATT&amp;CK uses a matrix with 14 attack tactics. Next, it divides these tactics across major platforms or technologies, including cloud and containers. In the cloud, there's a subdivision for Azure, AWS, and GCP.  </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">The full <a id="_idIndexMarker758"/>MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework can be found at <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">https://attack.mitre.org/</a>. However, it is recommended to follow MITRE on Twitter as well at <strong class="source-inline">@MITREattack</strong>. The matrix is open source, so a lively community is contributing to the tactics and techniques that are collected in the framework. MITRE invites people to join the community and actively contribute to their findings.</p>
			<p>In this section, we will briefly go over the 14 tactics and then specifically address the ones for containers, since these are widely used in <strong class="bold">Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>):</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reconnaissance</strong>: These<a id="_idIndexMarker759"/> techniques gather as much information as possible to prepare attacks. This includes scanning systems, but also social engineering, wherein the staff of organizations are used to get information.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Resource development</strong>: These<a id="_idIndexMarker760"/> techniques involve creating, purchasing, or stealing resources that hackers can use to execute an attack.   </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Initial access</strong>: This is <a id="_idIndexMarker761"/>the first attempt at gaining access to systems. This includes abusing valid (service) accounts and phishing. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Execution</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker762"/>technique is about running malicious code.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Persistence</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker763"/>technique gains access using backdoors. It uses containers to inject malicious code, boot, and log into initialization scripts. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Privilege escalation</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker764"/> technique involves using exploits to leverage privileges on systems to eventually gain more control. When it comes to using containers, this is a commonly used tactic. Containers should always be hardened to prevent them from gaining extra privileges. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Defense evasion</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker765"/> involves tactics wherein code is used to go around intrusion detection, logging, and other prevention measures. In cloud environments, this tactic is used to manipulate cloud (coded) firewalls by, for example, entering through an unused environment in a different region or unprotected sandbox environments. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Credential access</strong>: Typically, this<a id="_idIndexMarker766"/> involves brute-force attacks to get usernames and passwords.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Discovery</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker767"/>tactic is used to find user data, devices, applications, data, and services to gain as much information about the available systems as possible. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lateral movement</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker768"/>tactic is used to move systems and data from one host to another, sometimes in a different environment that's not under the control of the enterprise. Pass the hash and remote admin access are commonly used techniques.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Collection</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker769"/>tactic is used to collect data from keyboard strokes or screen captures, for instance. In the cloud, collecting API keys to access storage and key vaults are popular techniques.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Command and control</strong>: When <a id="_idIndexMarker770"/>using this technique, hackers try to communicate with systems in an attempt to gain control of them.  </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Exfiltration</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker771"/> tactic involves gaining control of data and data streams by, for instance, sending data to different storage environments and encrypting the data.  </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Impact</strong>: This is a <a id="_idIndexMarker772"/>broad category and includes denial of service techniques and resource hijacking. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>MITRE ATT&amp;CK is not a <a id="_idIndexMarker773"/>magic wand: it doesn't solve all security problems. It should be considered another source you can use to start protecting IT environments in a better way by providing different insights. It shows potential attack patterns and paths that security engineers can include in their security policies. MITRE ATT&amp;CK provides insights from specific platforms and technologies, which makes it rather unique. Common attack tactics may have different paths and patterns in various platforms, and that's where MITRE ATT&amp;CK is a good guardrail. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">In DevOps, scanning code is crucial. Static and dynamic scanning must be the default in CI/CD. Scanning is typically done against baselines. One baseline that is commonly used in DevOps is <strong class="bold">OWASP</strong>, the <strong class="bold">Open Web Application Security Project</strong>. OWASP is open source and yearly lists the<a id="_idIndexMarker774"/> top 10 vulnerabilities in applications. We will discuss OWASP in more detail in <a href="B17492_14_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor168"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, <em class="italic">Integrating DevSecOps with DevOps</em>. </p>
			<p>In the next section, we will show you how the matrix can be used to better protect containers. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-160"><a id="_idTextAnchor162"/>Using MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics for containers</h2>
			<p>So, how<a id="_idIndexMarker775"/> does MITRE ATT&amp;CK work in practice? Let's use the matrix for<a id="_idIndexMarker776"/> containers, since they are frequently used in CI/CD pipelines, as an example. First, we must go to the specific matrix on <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/containers/">https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/containers/</a>. You will recognize some of the 14 tactics that we discussed in the previous section. Not all of them are applicable; for containers, eight tactics have proven to be relevant:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Initial access</li>
				<li>Execution</li>
				<li>Persistence</li>
				<li>Privilege escalation</li>
				<li>Defense evasion</li>
				<li>Credential access</li>
				<li>Discovery</li>
				<li>Impact</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Next, we can look at one of these tactics. We will use <strong class="bold">Execution</strong> as an example, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer092" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_13_002.jpg" alt="Figure 13.2 – Tab in MITRE ATT&amp;CK for containers&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.2 – Tab in MITRE ATT&amp;CK for containers</p>
			<p>The top two in Execution are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Container Administration Command</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Deploy Container</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>If we click on the first one, <strong class="bold">Container Administration Command</strong>, the matrix provides us with information on how a specific vulnerability in container administration has been exploited. The vulnerability itself may occur while managing the containers using, for instance, a Docker daemon or the Kubernetes API. These may allow remote access and <a id="_idIndexMarker777"/>management to be used while the containers are <a id="_idIndexMarker778"/>launched. MITRE gives two examples of techniques that have been used for this. The first technique is Hildegard, which makes it possible to execute commands on running containers using the kubelet API run command. Kinsing, the second technique that MITRE mentions, exploits an Ubuntu entry point to run shell scripts to take over container administration processes.  </p>
			<p>Next, the matrix provides mitigations. In the given examples, the mitigating actions are using read-only containers and limiting communications with the container service, daemon, or Kubernetes using remote access via SSH. </p>
			<p>You will find that Kinsing also appears under the <strong class="bold">Deploy Container</strong> tab, next to the Doki exploit, which is a piece of malware that was discovered in the spring of 2020 and targets Docker containers. </p>
			<p>The matrix will guide you through various exploits and help you mitigate them. </p>
			<p>With that, we've discussed the contents of the various frameworks. In the next section, we will learn how to use them in DevSecOps and how compliance reports are created to show that frameworks have been applied. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-161"><a id="_idTextAnchor163"/>Applying frameworks to DevSecOps</h1>
			<p>In this section, we<a id="_idIndexMarker779"/> will learn how to include the controls of <a id="_idIndexMarker780"/>frameworks in DevOps and embed them as DevSecOps. Good news: it's not as hard as it may sound. The following diagram shows this process:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer093" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_13_003.jpg" alt="Figure 13.3 – Process of applying controls from security frameworks to DevOps&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.3 – Process of applying controls from security frameworks to DevOps</p>
			<p>In general, we start by assessing the framework that the enterprise needs to apply to their IT environments. From that assessment, the different controls are derived and set to the development and deployment cycles of applications and infrastructure. As soon as code is pulled from the repositories, scanning starts against these controls. </p>
			<p>We are using the CIS benchmark as an example here since CIS is the most used framework for setting security controls. Applying controls starts with the realization that in DevOps, the IT environments are highly dynamic by default. Everything, including the infrastructure, is turned into code, so applications will run in containers or in serverless mode. This calls for some specific controls. </p>
			<p>Some generic controls must be applied. These include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Vulnerability management</strong>: This must be implemented as a control before code is pushed to production, but with the principles of shift-left in mind, vulnerability scanning should already start from the moment that code is pulled from repositories. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Access</strong>: With this control, you can limit and manage the privileges of all resources, including containers.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Logging</strong>: This includes the logs while building and testing code. Sometimes, only logs are collected in production environments, but that is not sufficient if you want to be in control of the DevOps cycle. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are generic. CIS has<a id="_idIndexMarker781"/> developed a specific framework for securing containers, as shown in the following figure:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer094" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_13_004.jpg" alt="Figure 13.4 – The CIS Docker Benchmark&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.4 – The CIS Docker Benchmark</p>
			<p>This benchmark, as CIS calls it, contains controls for the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Linux host configuration; for example, ensuring a separate partition for containers and ensuring that only trusted users can control the Docker daemon.</li>
				<li>Docker daemon configuration; for example, running the daemon as a non-root user if possible and ensuring that containers are restricted in gaining new privileges.</li>
				<li>Container images and build file configuration; for example, ensuring that a container only uses trusted base images.</li>
				<li>Container runtime configuration; for example, Linux kernel capabilities are restricted in containers and ensuring that privileged ports are not mapped in containers.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>CIS has some generic recommendations too, such as making sure that containers are hardened and that the Docker version is up to date. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">All CIS benchmarks<a id="_idIndexMarker782"/> can be downloaded for free at <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/">https://www.cisecurity.org/</a>.</p>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker783"/> benchmark not only tells you <em class="italic">what</em> controls should be in place but also gives recommendations on <em class="italic">how</em> to implement these, together with the rationale of <em class="italic">why</em> the controls should be there. Well, look at the example where CIS recommends having a separate partition for containers – control 1.1.1 in CIS v1.3.1 (2021) for Docker.</p>
			<p>This starts with <em class="italic">profile applicability</em>. In control 1.1.1, this is set to Level 1-Linux host. This means that the settings are only applicable to the Linux host, providing a clear security benefit without hampering the intended functionality of a component – in this case, the Linux host. </p>
			<p>Next, the control itself is described, as well as the rationale behind it. In this example, it describes how Docker uses <strong class="source-inline">/var/lib/docker</strong> as the default to store all its components. The directory is shared with the Linux host, which means it can easily be filled up completely, making both Docker and the host unusable. Hence, a separate partition is recommended. Lastly, CIS provides a <em class="italic">manual</em> on how to do this by creating a separate partition for the <strong class="source-inline">/var/lib/docker</strong> mount point.<strong class="source-inline"> </strong></p>
			<p>Do you have to follow through on all these recommendations? No. CIS has made a clear distinction between critical and important controls. Obviously, the critical ones should be implemented in all cases, but you will need to assess every control, regardless of whether it makes sense to implement them in your DevOps practice. The golden rule here is that if you implement a control, you need to adhere to it consistently and report on it for compliance. Enterprises will be audited on rules and policies they have implemented. In the last section of this chapter, we will discuss reports and audits.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor164"/>Creating compliance reports and guiding audits</h1>
			<p>DevOps is taking a <a id="_idIndexMarker784"/>huge flight in enterprises. Embedding security in DevOps is a logical next step. But how can enterprises be sure that their DevOps and DevSecOps are <a id="_idIndexMarker785"/>compliant with the frameworks that we've discussed throughout this chapter? The answer to that question is: by audit. IT systems are regularly audited, and so should DevOps practices. Having said that, auditing DevOps is still <em class="italic">unchartered territory</em>, although major accounting firms such as KPMG and Deloitte have issued white papers on the subject. </p>
			<p>DevOps audits should include at least the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Evaluating the DevSecOps strategy</strong>: Is the<a id="_idIndexMarker786"/> strategy clear? How is governance arranged? A DevOps strategy can be set per business unit or enterprise-wide. Both are fine, so long as the strategy is followed through consistently. The goals should be clear and adopted by every team. The same applies to the way of working across all disciplines in the team. Processes such as testing procedures and acceptance criteria must be transparent and adhered to without exceptions.  </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Assessing the level of DevSecOps training</strong>: Training is not just simply creating a presentation with a one-slider on <strong class="bold">Scaled Agile Framework</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAFe</strong>) and showing<a id="_idIndexMarker787"/> the DevOps cycles. DevOps is very much about culture, but sometimes, organizations simply get overwhelmed by a sudden new way of working. For example, implementing DevOps also means creating teams with the right skills. This needs to be organized and goes further than just releasing<a id="_idIndexMarker788"/> the <strong class="bold">Spotify model</strong> in an organization. Staff don't organize themselves in guilds and squads just by telling them they must. An enterprise will need to train its staff in DevOps and make sure the teams have the right skill sets. Training also includes managing organizations. <p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">The Spotify model has become immensely popular in organizations as an approach to scaling the agile way of working, which DevOps is part of. The Spotify model, named after the agile way of working that was implemented by the audio-streaming service, advocates autonomy in teams, organized into squads. Each squad is allowed to choose its own toolsets and agile framework, such as Scrum or Kanban.   </p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reviewing the DevSecOps toolchain</strong>: Is there an architecture that specifies the DevOps tools, and is it coherent? Does it serve the strategy and is it aligned with the IT strategy of the enterprise? For example, if the enterprise has an open source strategy, then<a id="_idIndexMarker789"/> the tools must adhere to that. Lastly, just like any tool used in the enterprise, it needs to be put under architecture change control. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reviewing the DevSecOps processes</strong>: DevOps doesn't mean that processes are not valid anymore. Enterprises will still need to have the basic IT processes in place, such as incident management, problem management, and change management. These processes must be documented, including their escalation levels. Also, clear descriptions of the roles in these processes must be provided and followed through when implementing DevSecOps. Security management takes a special position here in that it must describe how security policies are defined, how they are implemented and managed in the enterprise, and how they are embedded in the DevOps process. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>With that, we've studied the basic principles of security in DevOps and the industry frameworks for security. Now, we need to merge – or rather integrate – security into our DevOps practice. That's the topic of <a href="B17492_14_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor168"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, <em class="italic">Integrating DevSecOps with DevOps</em>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-163"><a id="_idTextAnchor165"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we discussed various security frameworks. These frameworks are guidelines for setting security controls for the IT environments of the enterprise. These controls apply to systems and applications, and also to the DevOps practice. From the moment developers pull code from a repository and start the build, up until deployment and production, IT environments, including CI/CD pipelines, need to adhere to security controls. There are a lot of different frameworks. Some of them are generically and broadly accepted by enterprises, such as NIST, CIS, and COBIT. </p>
			<p>We also discussed the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, which takes a different angle by comparing itself to other security control frameworks. MITRE ATT&amp;CK lists tactics and techniques that hackers may use or have used to exploit vulnerabilities. Just like CIS, MITRE ATT&amp;CK lists specifics for various platforms and technologies, including containers that are commonly used in CI/CD. </p>
			<p>In the last section, we looked at auditing DevSecOps. It's recommended to review topics such as the consistent usage of tools, processes, and the skills of the DevOps teams. </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will integrate the security practice into DevOps and learn how enterprises can adopt a true DevSecOps strategy.</p>
