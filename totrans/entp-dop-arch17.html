			<h1 id="_idParaDest-166"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor168"/>Chapter 14</em>: Integrating DevSecOps with DevOps</h1>
			<p>The title of this chapter may sound a bit odd, but DevSecOps and DevOps aren't separate things. It should be one way of working: security should be integrated with the DevOps practice, instead of security principles being added on top of DevOps. This means that architects have to define one overarching governance model, integrate threat modeling into DevOps, and aim for an integrated toolset. Lastly, integrated monitoring needs to cover every aspect of the DevSecOps cycle. We will learn that integrated monitoring comes close to something that we discussed earlier in this book: AIOps. In this chapter, we will pull everything together.</p>
			<p>After completing this chapter, you will have learned how to implement governance, understand threat modeling, and understand the importance of it in the secure <strong class="bold">software development life cycle</strong> (<strong class="bold">SDLC</strong>). You will have also learned how security is embedded into continuous integration and how this is monitored, as well as about some of the major tools in this domain.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Defining governance in DevSecOps</li>
				<li>Understanding and working with threat modeling</li>
				<li>Integrating tools and automation </li>
				<li>Implementing monitoring</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-167"><a id="_idTextAnchor169"/>Defining governance in DevSecOps</h1>
			<p>So far, we have drafted a DevSecOps architecture, identified processes, and then aligned these with the business goals of the enterprise. The next step is to manage all this, and that's the subject of <a id="_idIndexMarker790"/>governance. DevSecOps is not just a PowerPoint <a id="_idIndexMarker791"/>presentation and a Visio diagram showing the CI/CD pipelines. An enterprise needs skilled staff to work with it and a governance model that describes the secured digital operating model. In this section, we will discuss this by using the IT4IT framework by The Open Group as a best practice.   </p>
			<p>In <a href="B17492_06_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor077"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Defining Operations in Architecture</em>, we introduced value streams for products and described how IT creates value. The model can be seen in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer096" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_14_001.jpg" alt="Figure 14.1 – IT4IT value streams&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.1 – IT4IT value streams</p>
			<p>In <a id="_idIndexMarker792"/>IT4IT, <strong class="bold">Governance, Risk, and Compliance</strong> (<strong class="bold">GRC</strong>) is a supporting activity for the four value streams. This means <a id="_idIndexMarker793"/>that GRC is fully embedded in every value stream. What does GRC do?</p>
			<p>Simply put, GRC is about achieving objectives while managing uncertainties by applying agreed and accepted industry business policies. Every business needs to adhere to certain policies. These can be international regulations for trading, national laws, and also industry-specific standards. This includes security and data privacy regulations. Implementing GRC is not a one time-effort: enterprises will need to adjust regularly. That's where the GRC capability model comes in. This model is shown in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer097" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_14_002.jpg" alt="Figure 14.2 – The model for Governance, Risk, and Compliance&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.2 – The model for Governance, Risk, and Compliance</p>
			<p>This model consists of four elements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Learn</strong>: The objectives of the enterprise must be clearly defined, but these are set in the context <a id="_idIndexMarker794"/>wherein the enterprise is operating. For example, the objective of a hospital is making people better; the context is much broader and includes, for instance, relationships with pharmaceutical companies and health care insurance companies. The objectives and the context define the strategy of a company.   </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Align</strong>: The objectives of the enterprise and potential threats that endanger the strategy <a id="_idIndexMarker795"/>of the enterprise are assessed. This leads to requirements and countermeasures so that the enterprise can achieve its objectives and grab new opportunities while mitigating the threats.    </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Perform</strong>: This is the stage <a id="_idIndexMarker796"/>where undesired events are detected and actioned. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Review</strong>: The enterprise needs to constantly review if threats have been identified in time, rated <a id="_idIndexMarker797"/>appropriately, and that mitigating actions have been successful. This feeds back into learning, since the context might change and the strategy will need to be adapted.  </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Implementing and managing these capabilities requires governance. An enterprise will have to assign people to control these capabilities and the level of adoption of these capabilities at different levels in the enterprise. This includes integrating GRC capabilities into DevSecOps. How can we arrange a best practice governance model? </p>
			<p>We will need to look <a id="_idIndexMarker798"/>at the different levels in the enterprise, and that's what IT4IT does. The following diagram shows the high-level principles of the model:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer098" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_14_003.jpg" alt="Figure 14.3 – Model for different security governance levels in the enterprise&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.3 – Model for different security governance levels in the enterprise</p>
			<p>Let's look at these levels in more detail:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enterprise level</strong>: The key role at enterprise level is the enterprise architect, who is responsible <a id="_idIndexMarker799"/>for the architecture in the enterprise. At this level, the enterprise architect will work together with the <strong class="bold">Chief Information Officer</strong> (<strong class="bold">CIO</strong>). In modern enterprises, we see the role of the CIO changing <a id="_idIndexMarker800"/>and other roles being added. The <strong class="bold">Chief Digital Officer</strong> (<strong class="bold">CDO</strong>) and the Chief Data or Chief Privacy Officer appear more <a id="_idIndexMarker801"/>and more on the organizational charts. The CDO <a id="_idIndexMarker802"/>is an important position for implementing the digital transformation strategy, including the adoption of DevSecOps. Be aware that DevSecOps is never a strategic goal in itself: it's a methodology that guides digital transformation. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Value streams</strong>: The enterprise level is the strategic level; the value streams are the tactical level. The critical <a id="_idIndexMarker803"/>roles at this level are the domain architect and the SecOps engineer. They need to oversee the implementation of overarching DevOps architectures and security in the various DevOps teams.  </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">DevOps teams</strong>: The golden rules in DevOps are you build it, you run it and you break it, you fix it. This doesn't mean that there are no other rules – or better, guidelines – in DevOps. An enterprise <a id="_idIndexMarker804"/>seeks consistency in DevOps, across all the different teams. These teams will function autonomously, but they still need to adhere to centralized guidelines that are set at the enterprise level and implemented and managed at the value stream level. Why is this important? An enterprise service or product may very well be built by building blocks that are the responsibility of different DevOps teams. If the way of working, guidelines, and security guardrails are not aligned, the end product or service will most likely not meet the quality standards of the enterprise. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enabling teams</strong>: These are the teams that take care of the foundation; for example, the hosting <a id="_idIndexMarker805"/>platforms and the repositories that are used to store artifacts. DevOps engineers and developers will not need to worry about the network settings on the platform – these are arranged by the enabling team. <p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">This is an introduction to the full model. Please refer to the work of enterprise architect Rob Akershoek (<strong class="source-inline">@robakershoek</strong>), who made extensive contributions to the IT4IT framework. One of his books is listed in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section. </p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This section was about governance and controlling the processes in DevSecOps. In the next section, we will discuss how security teams and specialists can identify events that might impact how code is developed and deployed. A good understanding of and knowing how to work with threat modeling is a requirement. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-168"><a id="_idTextAnchor170"/>Understanding and working with threat modeling</h1>
			<p>In the previous section, we discussed the governance of security in the enterprise and how it's integrated as DevSecOps. In this section, we will learn how security issues can impact the SDLC. When it comes to integrating security in DevOps, you need to have a good understanding of<a id="_idIndexMarker806"/> threat modeling, which provides us with information on how security threats may affect how software code is developed and deployed. We'll start by explaining what threat modeling is by looking at the definition of <strong class="bold">The Open Web Application Security Project</strong> (<strong class="bold">OWASP</strong>). OWASP is an online community that provides insights <a id="_idIndexMarker807"/>into security threats, tools, and technology. </p>
			<p>In essence, a threat model <a id="_idIndexMarker808"/>shows how security threats could impact the integrity of an application. The model assembles and analyzes security data and helps in making decisions on how to protect the application, thus improving the security of code and the hosting environment, by assessing the requirements, revisiting the design, and implementing improved security policies. </p>
			<p>What is a threat? This is<a id="_idIndexMarker809"/> anything that impacts the application negatively and causes a failure or unwanted events, such as <a id="_idIndexMarker810"/>data leaks. Threat modeling identifies the possible vulnerabilities and then defines the mitigating actions. For identification, it can use the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, which we discussed in the previous chapter. Threat modeling is more than just detecting security issues, or even preventing or fixing them. </p>
			<p>Modeling is a structured, planned, and repeated activity that's used to continuously assess the environments and possible vulnerabilities, and then helps implement a structured approach to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Hence, threat modeling is something that needs to be conducted throughout the entire SDL, in which the model and the subsequent actions that are triggered by the model are continuously reviewed and refined. The reason for <a id="_idIndexMarker811"/>this is that during development, new features are added and maybe even new technologies. With that, there's a chance that new vulnerabilities – threats – will be introduced, so the model needs to be constantly revised. </p>
			<p>Threat modeling typically involves the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scope analysis</strong>: What is the scope of our threat model and analysis? Think of application code, programming <a id="_idIndexMarker812"/>language (for example C#, Python, or Java), APIs, virtual machines, platforms (think of cloud platforms such as AWS or Azure), database engines (for example SQL, Postgres, or Cassandra), and databases. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Identify threat agents</strong>: In MITRE ATT&amp;CK, we focus on the vulnerabilities and techniques in which these have been exploited. In threat modeling, we also identify who might be interested in an attack. OWASP calls these threat agents: these can be both internal and external. The reason for making this clear distinction is to identify if environments are <em class="italic">fault-tolerant</em> for insiders or easy to breach from the outside.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Assess mitigations</strong>: OWASP refers to this as countermeasures. Known mitigations – for instance, the possibility to enroll patches – must be included in the model. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Assess vulnerabilities</strong>: If you know the scope, the possible attackers, and have identified possible countermeasures, then we can start analyzing vulnerabilities. Are these in the scope, who can they be exploited by, and what specific mitigating actions can be taken to prevent or minimize the impact?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Prioritize risks</strong>: Analyze the likelihood that vulnerabilities are being exploited and what the actual damage would be. This defines the priority of the threat. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Execute mitigation</strong>: Based on the priority, mitigating actions must be set in action to reduce the risks that have been identified.  <p class="callout-heading">Tip</p><p class="callout">The OWASP community manages its <a id="_idIndexMarker813"/>own GitHub pages for threat modeling. These can be found at <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/www-community/blob/master/pages/Threat_Modeling.md">https://github.com/OWASP/www-community/blob/master/pages/Threat_Modeling.md</a>.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are more models that define threat modeling, but in essence, they all come down to the same principles: assess, identify the threats, rate the threats, and identify risk-reducing actions.  </p>
			<p>We have security under governance, and we know how to assess our environments in terms of possible threats. The next step is to have this automated and integrated into the DevOps tooling. If we have done that, then we can say that we've implemented DevSecOps. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-169"><a id="_idTextAnchor171"/>Integrating tools and automation </h1>
			<p>Throughout this book, we've discussed the importance of testing a couple of times. DevOps advocates testing at every single stage in the life cycle, from development to deployment. This includes security testing. But how can we achieve this continuous integration? The goal is to have tests running at developer check-in, while they pull code from repositories, during the builds, and during the actual deployments, including staging. </p>
			<p>Let's look at <strong class="bold">continuous integration</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI</strong>) first. Developers will frequently do check-ins on code; in some cases, this can be up to several builds per day. That's the aim of CI and the agile <a id="_idIndexMarker814"/>way of working in DevOps: developers don't work on huge programs anymore; instead, they apply small iterations of code builds, adding one feature at a time. This way, it's easier to track changes in the code and, importantly, roll back if the addition is causing failures. </p>
			<p>CI is about integrating these changes and additions into the code. The developer checks in, modifies the code, and releases it to the feature branch. From there, it's pushed to production and back into the repository, where the source code gets updated with that small new chunk of code, all in a very short timeframe. Since these are small iterations of the code, integrating that code and implementing it in production is easier than doing so for big releases. However, this only works well if the code is tested along the way. All tests must be applied to every new build and to every modification of the build. </p>
			<p>In DevOps pipelines, we run these tests in an automated way. This requires integrated tooling to package the code, running the scripts to launch the appropriate infrastructure, applying the security policies, launching monitoring, and executing the tests. </p>
			<p>In conclusion, testing is done throughout the entire development and deployment cycle. The following diagram shows what we mean by this, while also applying the principle of shift left:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer099" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17492_14_004.jpg" alt="Figure 14.4 – Applying shift left in security testing&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.4 – Applying shift left in security testing</p>
			<p>This includes security testing. After all, the goal <a id="_idIndexMarker815"/>is to integrate this <a id="_idIndexMarker816"/>with the DevOps tools and automate the CI/CD pipelines. We run security tests at the following instances:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Code Repository</strong>: Checking in and pulling source code</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Build</strong>: Writing, modifying, and compiling the code</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Pre-release or staging</strong>: Production-like testing before the actual deployment to production and the master branch</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In <a href="B17492_12_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Architecting for DevSecOps</em>, we discussed the various types of scanning that we <a id="_idIndexMarker817"/>can apply to pipelines, such as <strong class="bold">Static Application Security Testing</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAST</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Dynamic Application Security Testing</strong> (<strong class="bold">DAST</strong>). </p>
			<p>All of these tests can and <a id="_idIndexMarker818"/>should be automated. For a lot of enterprises, this is a true paradigm shift. Many security engineers and managers will persist in manual testing, rather than automating security testing. The problem is that security testing will become a bottleneck in DevOps: deployment is halted or, at best, slowed down by security testing. That's the reason why we want to integrate and automate security testing into our pipelines and at every stage of the SDLC. </p>
			<p>Next, with automated and fully integrated security testing, we ensure that developers receive immediate feedback on vulnerabilities in the code. This will definitively improve the code.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-170"><a id="_idTextAnchor172"/>Integrating Static Application Security Testing</h2>
			<p>SAST is crucial. We briefly discussed this in <a href="B17492_12_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Architecting for DevSecOps</em>, so now, we will <a id="_idIndexMarker819"/>dive in a bit deeper.</p>
			<p>First, we need to understand that there are two types of SAST:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>SAST tools <a id="_idIndexMarker820"/>that scan raw source code.</li>
				<li>SAST tools <a id="_idIndexMarker821"/>that scan decompiled source code from <a id="_idIndexMarker822"/>libraries, such as <strong class="bold">Dynamic-Link Library</strong> (<strong class="bold">DLL</strong>) or <strong class="bold">Java Archive</strong> (<strong class="bold">JAR</strong>).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>SAST tools scan the code line by line. They report where a potential vulnerability has been found in the code so that the developer knows exactly where to look. Most tools also rate the vulnerability and even provide suggestions for fixing the issue. Be aware that SAST tools need to be language-aware. They scan the source code, so they need to understand the <a id="_idIndexMarker823"/>language that the code is written in. Multiple SAST tools might be required if multiple languages are being used. </p>
			<p>SAST tools are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to enable scanning throughout the development process. Most tools identify security issues that are commonly reported and listed, such as those by OWASP. Every year, OWASP releases the top 10 web application security risks. Currently, the top 10 lists, among others, code injection, sensitive data exposure, and insufficient monitoring. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">The OWASP top 10 can be found at <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/</a>.</p>
			<p>We will go back to monitoring in the last section of this chapter. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-171"><a id="_idTextAnchor173"/>Integrating Dynamic Application Security Testing</h2>
			<p>DAST doesn't scan code. Simply put, DAST tooling simulates attacks. In <a href="B17492_13_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor159"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working with DevSecOps Using Industry Security Frameworks</em>, we discussed the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, which lists techniques that help exploit vulnerabilities. DAST tools run these techniques <a id="_idIndexMarker824"/>by injecting malicious code strings or by brute force. By doing this, DAST tries to identify vulnerabilities in the functionality of the application, rather than in the source code. </p>
			<p>DAST is sophisticated, which means it's costly. It runs transactions through the application and <a id="_idIndexMarker825"/>with that, it's also depending on components that interact with the application. For example, you could think of the frontend application and the database in the backend. DAST tooling needs to be configured well to be effective. </p>
			<p>On that last note, DAST comes close to penetration testing. Most security officers and engineers will rely on manual penetration testing to detect vulnerabilities in integrations between different application <a id="_idIndexMarker826"/>stacks and services, especially when these stacks and services are used by different platforms and providers. In modern IT, where systems consist of <strong class="bold">Infrastructure-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">IaaS</strong>), <strong class="bold">Platform-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">PaaS</strong>), and <strong class="bold">Software-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>) hosted on various <a id="_idIndexMarker827"/>platforms such as AWS, Azure, or in private data centers, integrating <a id="_idIndexMarker828"/>and testing integration points becomes more and more relevant.</p>
			<p>Please be aware that public cloud platforms have strict policies for penetration testing. As an example, AWS only supports this for a very limited number of services, such as their compute platform EC2. Violating these policies might inflict penalties or, in the worst case, a ban on the usage of services. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-172"><a id="_idTextAnchor174"/>Integrating using CircleCI orbs </h2>
			<p>A rather new phenomenon in the world of DevSecOps integration, but worth mentioning here, is orbs – reusable snippets of YAML code that take care of repeatable actions, such as <a id="_idIndexMarker829"/>security scanning. Orbs allow for direct integration with popular security scanning tools. It's a concept of CircleCI, a San Francisco-based company that delivers tooling to automate CI.  </p>
			<p>It claims out-of-the-box integrations for <a id="_idIndexMarker830"/>these tools into CI/CD pipelines. As an example, orbs for Probely (a web vulnerability scanner) and SonarCloud (code analysis) are available, but developers can also create their own orbs and push these to the open source Orb Registry.  </p>
			<p>Now that we've covered the integrated security frameworks and tooling, we have to make sure that we keep track of the outcomes. In the last section, we will discuss monitoring in more detail.  </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-173"><a id="_idTextAnchor175"/>Implementing monitoring</h1>
			<p>A crucial element of security is ensuring that the necessary security policies are in place and that the environments are indeed protected. This may sound simple, but it requires proper configuration of monitoring. Developers need information to help them fix bugs in the first place but also to improve the code and with that, the application. This applies to customer experience and performance, but also to ensuring that the application remains protected. Hackers don't sit on their hands: they constantly find out new ways of attacking systems. Hence, we need to constantly monitor what happens to and inside an application. </p>
			<p>Security monitoring is not only about detecting unexpected behavior. It's about analyzing all behavior. This provides <a id="_idIndexMarker831"/>insights to developers to help them improve their code. For that, monitoring needs to facilitate three main services:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Collect</li>
				<li>Analyze</li>
				<li>Alert</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Sometimes, storage and visualization are added to these services. However, storing monitoring data is more about logging, while visualization is about comprehensively presenting monitoring data. These are important services, but they are not core to monitoring itself. Of course, you will need methodologies to receive and view alerts. As an example, Grafana is a popular tool that provides cross-platform dashboards that allow us to query and visualize stored monitoring data.</p>
			<p>Before we get to implementing <a id="_idIndexMarker832"/>monitoring, the architect needs to assess the following four W questions: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><em class="italic">What</em> are we monitoring?</li>
				<li><em class="italic">Why</em> are we monitoring <em class="italic">that</em> (and <em class="italic">why</em> not anything else)?</li>
				<li><em class="italic">When</em> are we monitoring <em class="italic">that</em>?</li>
				<li><em class="italic">Who</em>'s paying attention (who needs to be informed)?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The <em class="italic">what</em> is about collecting data, the <em class="italic">why</em> is triggering analyses, and the <em class="italic">who</em> is about sending alerts to the right people or entities within the enterprise. As we mentioned previously, monitoring properly is crucial to the feedback loop that we have in DevOps, including alerts regarding security events that may impact the systems. It's a big misunderstanding that systems that are code only and hosted on cloud platforms are monitored and secured by default. They are not. Platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud merely provided huge toolboxes that you can use to secure code that you run on the platforms. Engineers will need to configure the monitoring themselves. This includes monitoring the infrastructure, such as the health statuses of the <strong class="bold">virtual machines</strong> (<strong class="bold">VMs</strong>) that are used in the cloud. A certain increase in the usage of the VM – an unexplainable <a id="_idIndexMarker833"/>peak in the CPU or memory of the VM – might indicate that something wrong. </p>
			<p>Next, to be useful for DevOps, monitoring must collect metrics from the application itself. This way, monitoring provides information on the running state of the application. Applications must be enabled to provide this information to monitoring systems. This information is typically labeled in the code of the application. Examples include labels such as <strong class="bold">debug</strong> and <strong class="bold">warning</strong>. Monitoring will pick <a id="_idIndexMarker834"/>up this information and make sure that it gets <a id="_idIndexMarker835"/>to the engineers in a comprehensible format.    </p>
			<p>How do monitoring tools do that? There are a couple of ways it does this, but in most cases, tools use either agents that collect data on systems or they simulate – agentless – transactions. With transactions, tools will send a transaction to the application and analyze the response if and when the transaction is returned. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Transaction-based monitoring doesn't mean that these tools can't or won't use agents. There are agent and agentless systems. Some enterprises have policies that state that agents on their systems are prohibited because of overhead on systems, or because enterprises fear the intrusiveness of agents. </p>
			<p>In the case of <a id="_idIndexMarker836"/>monitoring agents, these can and should be part of the desired state configuration of the application when it's deployed to the platform. Remember shift-left: this should be integrated into the entire DevOps chain so that monitoring starts from the moment code is pushed to the development, test, and staging systems. In other words, monitoring is not just for production. </p>
			<p>Because of the capabilities that monitoring tools must have, these tools can become very vast and complicated. Agents might lead to some so-called overhead on systems, meaning that the agents will increase their use of resources in systems or trigger more network traffic. These aspects should be taken into architectural consideration. Again, start with the four W questions.</p>
			<p>Lastly, enterprises might not end up with just one monitoring tool, but with a chain of tools. They might use AWS CloudWatch or Azure Monitor to monitor the cloud resources, Prometheus to collect real-time data in highly dynamic systems such as container platforms, and Sysdig for cloud-native applications. Specifically for security monitoring, enterprises can use Splunk Security Essentials or the cloud-native Azure Sentinel. Be aware that a lot of security tooling focuses on network and identity and access to systems, and not so much on the applications or application code. That's why enterprises end up with monitoring toolchains: it's for a good reason. Architects have a big say in what tools fulfill the needs of the enterprise. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">We will only mention a couple of tools here. This is by no means meant to be exhaustive or to promote specific tools over other tools. The tools that are mentioned here are widely used in enterprises, but there are many other, great tools available.  </p>
			<p>Engineers probably don't want to use several consoles to watch the output of these different tools. Overarching enterprise suites such as ServiceNow and BMC Helix provide broker platforms that enable the single pane of glass view: various monitoring tools and data collection processes can be aggregated in this one suite. These are complex systems that require highly skilled professionals to implement and configure, but in a world where IT is becoming more complicated by the day, the investment is worthwhile. Regarding DevOps <a id="_idIndexMarker837"/>teams, remember that they are fully responsible for developing, deploying, and operating their code. You might not want to rely on these "monolith" types of overall management systems, but in enterprises with a wide variety of products and services, it's essential to have a complete overview of all the assets, developments, and the state of these deployments. </p>
			<p>So, we have adhered to security frameworks, defined the policies, and integrated the tools in our DevOps and CI/CD cycle, but are we really good to go? IT is changing rapidly and becoming more challenging every day. Attacks and breaches are in the news every day. This has a big impact on how we secure our systems. We can't trust anyone in our enterprise networks anymore. On the other hand, we want to give developers as much freedom as possible so that we get the best results in terms of coding. After all, the first statement in DevOps is about trust: you build, you run it – because you can. But how do we deal with trust? That's the final topic of this book: zero trust architectures and how they impact DevOps.  </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-174"><a id="_idTextAnchor176"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>DevOps and DevSecOps are not separate things: security must be fully integrated with DevOps. In this chapter, we discussed how we integrate security in DevOps, not only focusing on scanning tools but mainly on governance, applying threat modeling, and monitoring our DevOps environments. For governance, we looked at the principles of GRC that allow enterprises to manage uncertainties – such as security risks – while defining strategies to achieve their business goals. This is the foundational step to integrating security into all the layers of the enterprise and with that, the development of products and services.</p>
			<p>To detect, recognize, and counterfeit attacks, we need to work with threat modeling. In this chapter, we discussed OWASP, which provides insights into how security events can impact businesses. Next, we look at security scanning in a more detailed way. SAST and DAST are necessities in DevSecOps.</p>
			<p>In the last section, we learned about the various steps that an architect needs to take to implement monitoring. They need to ask themselves four basic questions: what are we monitoring?, why are we monitoring that?, when do we monitor that?, and who needs to be informed? We also looked at the characteristics of monitoring tools.</p>
			<p>Security is about trust and in modern IT, with an increasing number and variety of attacks, the basic rule is that enterprises can't trust anyone or anything anymore. This leads to a specific area in architectures: zero trust. This is the topic of the final chapter of this book.  </p>
