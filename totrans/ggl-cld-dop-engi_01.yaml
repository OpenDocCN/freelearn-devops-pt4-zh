- en: The core focus of this section is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). The section
    starts with the evolution of DevOps and its life cycle and introduces SRE as a
    prescriptive way to implement DevOps. The emphasis is on defining the reliability
    of a service and ways to measure it. In this section, SRE technical practices
    such as Service-Level Agreement (SLA), Service-Level Objective (SLO), Service-Level
    Indicator (SLI), error budget, and eliminating toil are introduced and are further
    elaborated. Fundamentals and critical concepts around monitoring, alerting, and
    time series are also explored to track SRE technical practices. However, SRE technical
    practices cannot be implemented within an organization without bringing cultural
    change. Google prescribes a set of SRE cultural practices such as incident management,
    being on call, psychological safety, and the need to foster collaboration. This
    section also explores the aspects critical to building SRE teams and provides
    insights into the SRE engagement model. It's important to note that the start
    of the section introduces services in Google Cloud to implement DevOps through
    the principles of SRE; however, the details of those services are explored in
    the next section.
