			<h1 id="_idParaDest-88"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>Chapter 4</em>: Building SRE Teams and Applying Cultural Practices</h1>
			<p>The last three chapters introduced the fundamentals of <strong class="bold">Site Reliability Engineering</strong> (<strong class="bold">SRE</strong>), traced its origins, laid out how SRE is different than DevOps, introduced SRE jargon along with its key technical practices such as <strong class="bold">Service Level Agreements</strong> (<strong class="bold">SLAs</strong>), <strong class="bold">Service Level Objectives</strong> (<strong class="bold">SLOs</strong>), <strong class="bold">Service Level Indicators</strong> (<strong class="bold">SLIs</strong>), and <strong class="bold">Error Budgets</strong>, and focused on monitoring and alerting concepts to target reliability.</p>
			<p>This chapter will focus on the fundamentals required to build SRE teams and apply cultural practices such as handling facets of incident management, being on call, achieving psychological safety, promoting communication, collaboration and knowledge sharing. These fundamentals and cultural practices can be used as a blueprint for teams or organizations that want to start their SRE journey.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Building SRE teams</strong> – Staffing, creating SRE teams, and engaging the team</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Incident management</strong> – Incident life cycle and constructs to handle the incident</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Being on call</strong> – Challenges to tackle, operational overload, and effective troubleshooting</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Psychological safety and fostering collaboration</strong> – Factors to achieve psychological safety, unified vision, communication, and collaboration and knowledge sharing</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>Building SRE teams</h1>
			<p>Google defined <a id="_idIndexMarker411"/>the principles of SRE by applying the concepts of software engineering to system operations. Google was implementing these principles even before the term <em class="italic">DevOps</em> was coined. They developed best practices over a period of time and essentially considered SRE as their secret sauce for efficient running of their products. With the advent of <strong class="bold">Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</strong>, Google became more vocal about the SRE principles and their relevance for the success of their customers that deal with maintaining, running, and operating distributed systems on GCP.</p>
			<p>Given SRE is a prescriptive way of doing DevOps, more and more organizations (and this also includes non-GCP customers) are currently tending toward implementing the principles of SRE in a <a id="_idIndexMarker412"/>quest to find a balance between service reliability and development velocity. Such organizations will face the following challenges:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How do you staff an SRE team?</li>
				<li>How do you implement or run an SRE team?</li>
				<li>When and how often are SRE teams engaged during the life cycle of a service?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following sub-sections answer these questions based on the best recommendations from Google.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>Staffing SRE engineers (SREs)</h2>
			<p>An SRE team consists of SRE engineers or SREs. At the outset, SREs also run operations. It is hard to <a id="_idIndexMarker413"/>find seasoned SREs. However, one way to build an SRE team is to hire system administrators who have worked on operations along with having experience in scripting/coding. These personnel can be further trained with software engineering skills.</p>
			<p>The following is a list of recommended skills that personnel hired as SRE engineers or SREs should possess <a id="_idIndexMarker414"/>or ultimately be trained on:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Operations and software engineering</strong>: SREs should have experience of running a production system and have an understanding of the software or application that needs to be supported.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Monitoring systems</strong>: SLOs are key to maintaining the reliability of a service and SREs need to understand the functioning of monitoring systems in order to track SLOs and their connected constructs such as SLIs and Error Budgets.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Production automation</strong>: SREs can effectively scale operations by ensuring that the same task is not performed manually and instead automation is put in place. This requires an understanding of how to automate the process.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">System architecture</strong>: SREs can effectively scale an application or service, and this requires a deep understanding of the system architecture.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Troubleshooting</strong>: SREs are regularly required to be on call to solve problems of different <a id="_idIndexMarker415"/>types and complexities. This requires an inquisitive and analytical approach to solving the problems in hand.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Culture of trust</strong>: SREs and developers share the ownership of a service through the concept of Error Budgets. This requires SREs to build a trust with the development team through effective communication.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Incident management</strong>: Failures or issues are inevitable and one of the key functions of SREs is to handle an incident. This requires the ability to technically troubleshoot and establish a communication framework specific for managing incidents.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition to the recommended skills, SRE engineers or SREs should also possess certain character <a id="_idIndexMarker416"/>traits such as resilience, assertiveness, and flexibility. These characteristics will help them to deal with difficult situations and use reasoning in case of ambiguous situations, and strike a balance between development velocity and reliability. The next topic will deep-dive into the types of SRE team implementations.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-91"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>SRE team implementations – procedure and strategy</h2>
			<p>There are <a id="_idIndexMarker417"/>six recommended SRE team implementations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Kitchen sink/everything SRE team</li>
				<li>Infrastructure SRE team</li>
				<li>Tools SRE team</li>
				<li>Product/application SRE team</li>
				<li>Embedded SRE team</li>
				<li>Consulting SRE team</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each implementation type suits a specific organization based upon the complexity of services that the organization provides, the size of the organization, the number of kinds of development <a id="_idIndexMarker418"/>teams in terms of varying scopes, and the organization's level of adoption with respect to applying SRE principles. Some organizations can also implement more than one type based on their needs. Let's look at the different team implementations in detail.</p>
			<h3>Kitchen sink/everything SRE team</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">kitchen sink/everything SRE team</strong> is best suited for organizations that want to start <a id="_idIndexMarker419"/>their SRE journey. In most cases, organizations prefer to start with a single SRE team. The scope of such a team is unbounded. The kitchen sink/everything SRE team is recommended for organizations that <a id="_idIndexMarker420"/>currently have a limited scope because there are fewer applications, resulting in fewer user journeys.</p>
			<p>Given that there is only a single SRE team, this type of team can act as a binding factor between development teams and can also spot patterns across projects to provide effective solutions in case of incidents. At the same time, identifying engineers for SRE teams with the required skill sets can be quite challenging. In addition, with the possibility of constantly changing scope, the kitchen sink team implementation can suffer from lack of clarity in terms of well-defined team goals and can eventually lead to operational overload. </p>
			<h3>Infrastructure SRE team</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">infrastructure SRE team</strong> is best suited for organizations that have multiple development <a id="_idIndexMarker421"/>teams with varying scopes, complexities, and <a id="_idIndexMarker422"/>infrastructure requirements. The core focus of an infrastructure team is on behind-the-scenes tasks that help the development teams to get their job done easier and faster. An infrastructure SRE team is less focused on customer-facing code and more on maintaining the shared services and components related to stabilizing the infrastructure.</p>
			<p>The main advantage of an infrastructure SRE team is to provide the same highly reliable infrastructure to the development teams to simulate the behavior that could potentially happen in a production environment. In addition, the infrastructure team also establishes the structure to access such environments using the principles of least privilege and adhering to the required compliance standards.</p>
			<p>On the flip side, given that the infrastructure SRE team doesn't directly work with customers <a id="_idIndexMarker423"/>and instead works with internal teams, there is always a tendency to over-engineer while defining standards <a id="_idIndexMarker424"/>for the development teams. Additionally, their usage behavior might also differ in comparison to the real world.</p>
			<p>At times, there might be multiple infrastructure teams based on the size of the company or its product lines. This could result in duplicate effort with respect to the manner in which infrastructure will be provisioned. This is something that needs to be closely monitored and can be potentially avoided through cross-infrastructure team meet-ups and regular updates.</p>
			<h3>Tools SRE team</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">tools SRE team</strong> is best suited for organizations with multiple development teams, where the <a id="_idIndexMarker425"/>development teams need a standard way to build or implement software that can measure, maintain, and improve the system reliability of a service, for example implementing a common framework that could allow the development <a id="_idIndexMarker426"/>team to implement custom metric instrumentation in their services, which could eventually help to measure reliability of a service.</p>
			<p>The tools SRE team aims to build highly specialized reliability-related tooling and ultimately define production standards. One of the major disadvantages is to clearly draw the line between a tools SRE team and an infrastructure SRE team, as they can be perceived as being very similar because they are aimed at providing focused help to development teams but at their core, their focus areas are different. The tools SRE team focuses more on improving the reliability of the individual service whereas the infrastructure SRE team focuses more on improving the reliability of the supporting infrastructure that runs the service.</p>
			<h3>Product/application SRE team</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">product/application SRE team</strong> is best suited for organizations that already have a kitchen sink, infrastructure, or tools SRE team and in addition have a critical user-facing <a id="_idIndexMarker427"/>application with multiple key <a id="_idIndexMarker428"/>services and high reliability needs for each service. The need for multiple reliable services requires a dedicated set of SRE teams focused on the product. This approach helps in setting out a clear charter for the team and also directly relates to business priorities.</p>
			<p>On the flip side, as the services or products grow, there will be a constant need to add more SRE teams. This also increases the chance that there might be duplication of effort among product/application SRE teams.</p>
			<h3>Embedded SRE team</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">embedded SRE team</strong> is best suited for organizations where a dedicated SRE team is required only for a specific time period or for an implementation focused on specific <a id="_idIndexMarker429"/>functions. In this SRE setup, the SRE engineers are actually embedded with the development team and this engagement is either scope bound, or time bound.</p>
			<p>SRE engineers <a id="_idIndexMarker430"/>are hands-on on a day-to-day basis with respect to handling code and the required configuration. An embedded SRE team can also effectively be used to drive adoption with respect to the proposals or changes put forward by the infrastructure or tools SRE team. The major advantage is to build SRE expertise for specific focus areas. However, on the flip side, given each SRE team will work with a different development team, there might be a lack of standard practices.</p>
			<h3>Consulting SRE team</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">consulting SRE team</strong> is best suited for organizations where the complexity is significant <a id="_idIndexMarker431"/>and the existing SRE teams cannot <a id="_idIndexMarker432"/>support the ever-increasing demands of their customers. Consulting SRE teams are similar to embedded SRE teams but are focused on the end customers and typically move away from changing any of the customer code or configuration. They could, however, write code to build internal tools for themselves or for their developer counterparts, similar to a tools SRE team. </p>
			<p>Consulting SRE teams are a good fit if additional support is required on a temporary basis for existing SRE teams but, on the flip side, the SREs might not have the required context to make a balanced decision.</p>
			<p>This completes the section on the various types of SRE team implementations. Essentially, there is no specific SRE team implementation that is recommended. It's common for an organization to implement a combination of these teams and the decision depends on multiple factors such as the size of the organization, the maturity level of adopting SRE, and their current focus.</p>
			<p>To summarize, if the intent of an organization is to get started with SRE, then kitchen sink implementation is probably the best place to start. If the size of the development organization is small but they have a critical user-facing application, it is possible to move from a kitchen sink implementation to a product/application SRE team implementation. </p>
			<p>However, if there <a id="_idIndexMarker433"/>are many development teams with different <a id="_idIndexMarker434"/>infrastructure needs, then it is possible to implement an infrastructure SRE team from a kitchen sink one. A tools SRE team is best suited for organizations that try to include common frameworks to bring in standardization in their software development process. A tools SRE team can complement an infrastructure SRE team.</p>
			<p>Embedded SRE teams are more laser-focused for a specific initiative where the development and SRE team work together to reliably implement a service. This can be seen in both small-sized and large-sized teams, based on the criticality of the initiative. Finally, a consulting team is best suited for complex organizations that already have implemented other possible SRE teams but still require a consulting team to support the increasing needs of a rapidly expanding customer base.</p>
			<p>The next topic will elaborate on how SRE engineers are engaged throughout the life cycle of a service or an application.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-92"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>SRE engagement model</h2>
			<p>The core principles <a id="_idIndexMarker435"/>of SRE are focused on maximizing development velocity while maintaining reliability. As the service goes through its life cycle phases, SRE team(s) can continuously contribute for the betterment of the service and these teams can be engaged at different stages (described as follows) with varying capacities.</p>
			<h3>Architecture and design</h3>
			<p>Let's explore <a id="_idIndexMarker436"/>what this phase entails for SREs (SRE engineers):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>SREs' engagement level is very deep (and high) during this phase as SRE teams can bring in their production expertise, offer various insights, and effectively can co-design the service.</li>
				<li>SREs validate the design and architecture by probing the design choices and validating any assumptions that were taken. This avoids any potential re-design.</li>
				<li>SREs put forward best practices during the design phase, such as resilience, by identifying the single points of failure.</li>
				<li>SREs recommend the best infrastructure systems based on prior experience and potential resource footprint in comparison with predicted load.</li>
				<li>SREs identify effective user journeys as part of the design process.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The next phase is active development.</p>
			<h3>Active development</h3>
			<p>Let's explore <a id="_idIndexMarker437"/>what this phase entails for SREs (SRE engineers):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Once the design is in place, SREs (SRE engineers) can help development teams ensure that the service is developed with production in mind. This includes capacity planning, identifying load requirements, and adding resources for redundancy.</li>
				<li>SREs help to plan for spikes and overloads. One way to handle the same is to use load balancers and also evaluate the capacity that they need to be configured. Setting up load balancers early in the development environments is a good start where the behavior can be initially assessed and hardened more during performance testing that simulates a production setup.</li>
				<li>SREs think through the identified user journeys and work with development teams (along with other stakeholders) to come up with approaches to meet their SLI and SLO requirements.</li>
				<li>SREs engage to add observability that includes configuring monitoring, alerting, and performance tuning. This helps in setting up the required infrastructure to track SLIs and SLOs.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>After development <a id="_idIndexMarker438"/>is complete, the service is made available to a limited number of users in the following phase.</p>
			<h3>Limited availability</h3>
			<p>Let's explore <a id="_idIndexMarker439"/>what the limited availability phase entails for SREs (SRE engineers):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Limited availability refers to the alpha (a release that is partially complete or still in development) and beta (a release where service is available to limited users for the first time post development) releases prior to general availability. During limited availability, the number of users, potential use cases, complexity, and performance requirements change significantly when compared to the development phase.</li>
				<li>SREs focus on measuring the performance based on the changing demands and essentially evaluate reliability by defining SLOs.</li>
				<li>SREs involve development teams in establishing operational practices similar to a real-time production environment. This helps to simulate the experience for internal teams in terms of what to expect when in production.</li>
				<li>SREs establish incident response teams by assigning specialized roles, conducting mock incident drills, and getting ready for a real-world scenario.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The next phase is general availability. This is the phase where the service has reached a stable state and is available for use by a wider audience or by other services.</p>
			<h3>General availability</h3>
			<p>Let's explore <a id="_idIndexMarker440"/>what the general availability phase entails for SREs (SRE engineers):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A service <a id="_idIndexMarker441"/>moves to general availability phase only if it passes the <strong class="bold">Production Readiness Review</strong> (<strong class="bold">PRR</strong>). This is potentially the longest phase that SREs are involved with and also own.</li>
				<li>SREs perform the majority of the operational work and own the incident response, with some help from the development team.</li>
				<li>It is possible that development team members work with SREs on a rotational basis so that the development team will have insights on operational load.</li>
				<li>SREs will focus on tracking the operational load and accompanying SLOs for the service. This ensures that Error Budgets are not exhausted, and new features can be rolled out.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When the current version of the service is going to be replaced, it enters the next phase, called depreciation.</p>
			<h4>Depreciation</h4>
			<p>Let's <a id="_idIndexMarker442"/>explore what the depreciation phase entails for SREs (SRE engineers):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>This refers to the phase when a new version of the system will soon come into play and replace the current version. So, new users or improved features are not added anymore. The focus shifts to transitioning users from existing to new systems through engineering means.</li>
				<li>SREs continue to support the existing system till end of life and work in parallel with development team(s) on new services by circling back to the architecture and design phase.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The last phase is the abandoned phase. This phase explains what happens to the service once the depreciation phase has passed.</p>
			<h4>Abandoned</h4>
			<p>Let's explore <a id="_idIndexMarker443"/>what the abandoned phase entails for SREs (SRE engineers):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Once the service end of life has been reached, the service is abandoned and SREs' engagement with respect to the service ends. A service reaches end of life either if the service is no longer supported by the development team or the service is not required by customers anymore.</li>
				<li>Development teams resume operational support and SREs support service incidents on a best-effort basis.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This completes the section on the SRE engagement model with the emphasis on how SRE engineers have a significant impact across the life cycle of the service right from its conceptualization to its end of life. The next section details a key SRE cultural practice called incident management.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-93"><a id="_idTextAnchor092"/>Incident management</h1>
			<p>Incident management is one of the key roles of an SRE engineer. An incident is defined as an event that indicates the possibility of an issue with respect to a service or an application. The nature <a id="_idIndexMarker444"/>of the issue can be minor in nature in the best case or, in contrast, can be an outage in the worst case. An incident can be triggered by an alert that was set up as part of monitoring the service or application.</p>
			<p>An alert is an indication that SLO objectives with respect to the service are being violated or are on track to be violated. Sometimes, and specifically for an external-facing application, an incident can be triggered by an end user complaining via social media platforms. Such incidents include an additional layer of retrospection on how or why the current alerting system put in place failed to identify the incident.</p>
			<p>Effective incident management is a critical SRE cultural practice that is key to limiting the disruption caused by an incident and is critical to resuming normal business operations as early as possible. There are two main parts to incident management:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The technical troubleshooting aspect (where the emphasis is on either mitigating the issue or resolving the issue)</li>
				<li>The effective communication aspect (where the emphasis is on ensuring the right folks are involved in the right roles, and stakeholders with respect to the service consumers are informed in a timely manner)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Organizations approach incident management in different ways but, if not approached in the right <a id="_idIndexMarker445"/>manner, it will result in an unmanaged incident. The following are two main characteristics of an unmanaged incident:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Emphasis on the technical problem</strong>: An operational issue typically has a cascading effect, especially in a complex system. So, it is common to miss the big picture while attempting to solve the technical issue at hand from a single viewpoint.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Poor communication</strong>: In an attempt to solve the incident at hand, it is possible that not enough attention is given to the communication aspect. This will have both internal and external implications. Internally, lack of communication will lead to an inefficient use of resources. Sometimes it can also lead to ad hoc involvement, where multiple people can work on the same problem that could also result in multiple people making changes to the system at the same time (which is not ideal). Externally, lack of communication will lead to frustrated customers, which will result in a loss of trust toward the service or application provider.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The next set <a id="_idIndexMarker446"/>of topics in this section detail the concepts required to effectively implement incident management, starting with the topic on the incident life cycle.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-94"><a id="_idTextAnchor093"/>Incident life cycle</h2>
			<p>Prior to coming <a id="_idIndexMarker447"/>up with an effective incident management strategy, it is important to understand the life cycle of an incident. The following is a state diagram that provides insights into the various states of an incident:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer036" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B15587_04_01.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1 – Life cycle of an incident&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.1 – Life cycle of an incident</p>
			<p>To summarize, based on configured alerts or complaints from social media, an incident is identified. The identified <a id="_idIndexMarker448"/>incident is validated to check whether it qualifies. If it qualifies, incident mitigation is initiated. After incident mitigation, a root cause analysis is initiated for the incident. The details of the incident are documented, a ticket is created, and after that the incident will move to resolved status. The next topic goes into the important concepts related to effective incident management.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor094"/>Elements of effective incident management</h2>
			<p>A structured incident response comprising of multiple elements is critical for effective incident <a id="_idIndexMarker449"/>management. These elements allow us to focus on core SRE cultural practices such as communication, collaboration, learning, knowledge sharing, organized flow of information, and effective customer notifications. This helps the team to deal with different situations and respond as quickly as possible. A structured incident response helps in reducing duplication of effort and creates visibility of any individual's activity within the team.</p>
			<p>The following are some of the critical elements for effective incident management.</p>
			<h3>Declaring an incident</h3>
			<p>In the case of an event leading to an incident, SREs or operators are often in a dilemma when <a id="_idIndexMarker450"/>deciding when to declare that incident. If they wait for a longer duration to declare an incident, then it might be too difficult to mitigate the negative impact that the incident can cause to the end users. However, if they declare it too early, then there is a chance that the incident can result in a false positive.</p>
			<p>The following are some guidelines that play a critical role in deciding when to declare an incident, starting with <em class="italic">defining thresholds</em>.</p>
			<h4>Defining thresholds</h4>
			<p>Every organization should define a clear set of thresholds in order to declare an event as an incident. These thresholds can be defined by setting up alerts. A specific event can be triggered <a id="_idIndexMarker451"/>by a single alert or a combination of alerts. An incident can also be triggered based on the total number of active alerts or the duration of an active alert.</p>
			<p>The next guideline to evaluate is <em class="italic">assessing impact</em>.</p>
			<h4>Assessing impact</h4>
			<p>Once guidelines <a id="_idIndexMarker452"/>are set, thresholds are defined and, as the alerts are fired, it is important to assess the impact of an event. There are multiple aspects involved in assessing the impact, such as the nature of the event, the impact to the end user, the eventual impact to the business, any dependent stakeholders at risk, or any financial loss to the business.</p>
			<p>The following is a reference template on how an incident can be classified based on possible impact:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Negligible</strong>: Little or no impact on product but might require follow-up action items</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Minor</strong>: Impact to internal users but external users might not notice</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Major</strong>: Impact to external users with noticeable revenue loss but services are still functioning</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Huge/disaster/detrimental</strong>: Outage severely impacting users and business with a significant revenue loss</li>
			</ul>
			<p>At a high <a id="_idIndexMarker453"/>level, the following questions can help to determine whether an event is an incident. If the answer is <em class="italic">yes</em> to any of the following, an incident can be declared:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Is the outage visible to users?</li>
				<li>Do SREs require the expertise of another team in order to evaluate the incident?</li>
				<li>Does the issue exist after an hour?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once an event is identified as an incident and its severity level has been identified, SREs or operators should formally declare the incident by issuing a statement that includes the severity level, a list of services impacted, and a possible estimated time of recovery. The summarizes the topic related to <em class="italic">declaring an incident</em> along with a few essential guidelines. The next critical element to discuss related to effective incident management is <em class="italic">separation of responsibilities</em>.</p>
			<h3>Separation of responsibilities</h3>
			<p>Once <a id="_idIndexMarker454"/>an incident has <a id="_idIndexMarker455"/>been declared, an incident response team should be formed whose main task is to mitigate or to resolve the incident. The members of the incident response team should have well-defined responsibilities. SRE prescribes a specific set of roles that should be designated within the team. The prescribed roles are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Incident Commander</strong> (<strong class="bold">IC</strong>)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Communications Lead</strong> (<strong class="bold">CL</strong>)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Operations Lead</strong> (<strong class="bold">OL</strong>)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Primary/Secondary Responder</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Planning Lead</strong> (<strong class="bold">PL</strong>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each of the <a id="_idIndexMarker456"/>preceding roles should have a clear <a id="_idIndexMarker457"/>charter and autonomy and the same is elaborated in the upcoming sub-sections, starting with the IC.</p>
			<h4>Incident Commander (IC)</h4>
			<p>The responsibilities <a id="_idIndexMarker458"/>of the IC are <a id="_idIndexMarker459"/>as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The IC leads <a id="_idIndexMarker460"/>the chain of command and designates specific roles to specific members of the team. Every member of the incident response team reports to the IC.</li>
				<li>The IC is and should be aware of significant events during an incident response, actively co-ordinate the response during an incident, decide priorities, and delegate activities.</li>
				<li>The IC's core goal is to ensure the problem is mitigated and ultimately fixed. However, the IC does not personally or individually fix the problem.</li>
				<li>The IC initiates the postmortem report after an incident is mitigated or resolved.</li>
				<li>Based on the size of the team, the IC can also assume the role of the CL.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The next topic details the responsibilities of the CL.</p>
			<h4>Communications Lead (CL)</h4>
			<p>The responsibilities <a id="_idIndexMarker461"/>of the CL are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The CL is <a id="_idIndexMarker462"/>the public face of the incident response and leads the communication with the outside world, provides timely updates, and also takes questions related to the incident.</li>
				<li>The CL acts as a shield and avoids direct communication between the customer/client and other members of the incident response team.</li>
				<li>The CL maintains the live incident state document, which is used later for postmortem.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The next topic details the responsibilities of the OL.</p>
			<h4>Operations Lead (OL)</h4>
			<p>The responsibilities <a id="_idIndexMarker463"/>of an OL are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The OL <a id="_idIndexMarker464"/>develops and executes the incident response plan, thereby being responsible for the technical and tactical work.</li>
				<li>The OL is responsible for the operations team, which comprises Primary and (optionally) Secondary Responders.</li>
				<li>The OL is always in contact with the IC and the CL. If required, the OL requests additional resources either for the operations teams or subject matter experts based on the specific nature of the incident.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The next topic details the responsibilities of the Primary/Secondary Responder.</p>
			<h4>Primary/Secondary Responder</h4>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker465"/>responsibilities of a <a id="_idIndexMarker466"/>Primary/Secondary Responder are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Primary and (optionally) Secondary Responders are members of the operations team and report to the OL. Their main goal is to execute the OL's technical response plan for the incident.</li>
				<li>The Secondary Responder is there to help the Primary Responder or can be designated a particular task or function based on the OL.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The next topic details the responsibilities of the PL.</p>
			<h4>Planning Lead (PL)</h4>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker467"/>responsibilities of the PL are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The PL works with the operations team and tracks system changes and arranges hand-offs as necessary.</li>
				<li>The PL arranges hand-offs between teams and also reports bugs to keep track of long-term changes.</li>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.2 - Illustrating Incident Management Roles</p>
			<p>Having well-defined <a id="_idIndexMarker468"/>roles allows SRE engineers to have a specific area of focus and also prevents outside ad hoc intervention. It is critical to establish a communication post, which could be a physical location such as a meeting room or a communication channel such as Slack. In addition, implementing a clear real-time hand-off either at the end of a shift or the day is highly recommended to ensure the incident is handed off explicitly to another incident commander.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Summarizing the principles of incident response</p>
			<p class="callout">The core principles include the need to maintain a clear chain of command, designate well-defined roles, maintain a live incident state document, ensure timely communication to the impacted parties about the incident state, perform a live hand-off to avoid operational overload, prepare a postmortem report to determine the root cause, update playbooks as needed, and plan to perform <strong class="bold">Disaster Recovery</strong> (<strong class="bold">DR</strong>) exercises as often as possible.</p>
			<p>The next <a id="_idIndexMarker469"/>critical element to discuss related to effective incident management is <em class="italic">recommended best practices</em>.</p>
			<h3>Recommended best practices</h3>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker470"/>is a summary of best practices that are recommended during the incident management process:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Develop and document procedures.</li>
				<li>Prioritize damage and restore service.</li>
				<li>Trust team members in specified roles.</li>
				<li>If overwhelmed, ask for help.</li>
				<li>Consider response alternatives.</li>
				<li>Practice procedure routinely.</li>
				<li>Rotate roles among team members.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the next topic, we will see how we can restore the service after an incident occurs and prevent such incidents from happening in the future.</p>
			<h3>Restoring service and avoiding recurrence</h3>
			<p>Once an incident has been declared, the focus of the incident response team should be to troubleshoot <a id="_idIndexMarker471"/>the incident. This could be initiated by thinking through the various steps involved in the functioning <a id="_idIndexMarker472"/>of the service and stepping through the inner details. The incident can be caused either by internal or external factors. Both kinds of factors should be examined.</p>
			<p>While examining internal factors, the focus should be on analyzing any recent code or configuration changes in the area of impact. In most scenarios, a code or configuration change can be reverted, which would eventually restore the service. But there will be situations where multiple code or configuration changes cannot be reverted from a deployment standpoint and the only way to move forward is to provide a code-level fix in order to revert the changes. In contrast to internal factors, examining or dealing with external factors is more complicated, as in most cases there is little control over them. </p>
			<p>Irrespective of the nature of the issue, the primary goal is to find ways to resolve or mitigate the issue. Once the issue is mitigated or resolved, a postmortem should be conducted, with the intention to identify the root cause. The process should happen in a blameless fashion with the sole intention to find ways that could prevent the incident from re-occurrence in the future.</p>
			<p>The postmortem process should result in a postmortem report that essentially outlines the events of the incident and consists of details with respect to the nature of the impact, the possible root cause, the triggering event, the metrics that help in identifying the event, and a list of action items. In addition, the postmortem report should provide clarity that can help in future mitigation and can be used as use case scenarios (after the incident). This further helps to promote learning among teams.</p>
			<p>This completes <a id="_idIndexMarker473"/>an in-depth section on incident management. We started the section by trying to outline the life cycle <a id="_idIndexMarker474"/>of an incident (<em class="italic">Figure 4.1</em>) and then elaborated on key constructs of effective incident management, charted the life cycle of an incident, detailed the possible roles and their respective responsibilities and recommended a set of best practices.</p>
			<p>Essentially, it is important to differentiate when to call out an incident, identify the impacted parties (internal or external users), assess the level of impact, have predefined roles if an incident is called, and attempt to stick to the charter. This avoids ambiguity in communication and collaboration. This also allows you to focus on the key goal, which is to mitigate the issue and restore the service at the earliest. It is also critical to investigate, identify, and address the root cause to avoid re-occurrence.</p>
			<p>The next section focuses on the process of being on call (another SRE cultural practice) and the critical factors that need to be considered.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor095"/>Being on call</h1>
			<p>On call duty <a id="_idIndexMarker475"/>refers to specific operational activities performed to support the reliable running of a service or application both during working and non-working hours. On call duty is one of the critical responsibilities for an SRE and is also important from a service standpoint to keep the service available and reliable. SRE teams (as previously defined) are different from regular operational teams as the goal is to emphasize the use of engineering techniques to solve operational problems and to prevent their occurrence at scale. It is typically common to engage the product/application SRE team during on call. In the case of specialized services, embedded SRE teams are engaged for on call duty. </p>
			<p>When an incident occurs, the response time from initiating the incident management process to <a id="_idIndexMarker476"/>resolving or mitigating the issue is key to meeting the desired SLO, which in turn will meet the promised SLA. There are multiple factors that need to be considered while implementing the on call process. The following are three such considerations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Paging versus non-paging events</li>
				<li>Primary versus secondary on call rotation</li>
				<li>Single-site versus multi-site production teams</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The next topic discusses <em class="italic">paging versus non-paging events</em>, one of the key factors in implementing the <em class="italic">on call</em> process.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor096"/>Paging versus non-paging events</h2>
			<p>Paging events refers to higher-priority alerts that require immediate attention or remediation, especially in the case of a user-facing application. Examples of paging events <a id="_idIndexMarker477"/>could be scenarios where the <a id="_idIndexMarker478"/>service health check fails, or a database <a id="_idIndexMarker479"/>tied to the service is unable to accept any more connections.</p>
			<p>Non-paging events refer to lower-priority alerts that might not point to a service failure but point to issues that need to be addressed before they snowball into a bigger incident. Example of non-paging events include a sudden spike in traffic due to a new feature release in a specific region or a lower-priority ticket raised by a self-healing process when disk usage went up to 80% but then was mitigated automatically by an automated process that increased the disk space by an extra 10%. This allows enough time for the on call engineer to investigate the root cause on the disk usage spike in the first place.</p>
			<p>Paging events are always the top priority for the SRE team. The first step in such a scenario is to validate whether the event is an incident and take appropriate steps to initiate the incident management process. In addition, SRE teams also vet non-production <a id="_idIndexMarker480"/>paging events and handle <a id="_idIndexMarker481"/>those events during their business <a id="_idIndexMarker482"/>hours based on operational load. It is important to differentiate between paging and non-paging events. This differentiation needs to be factored while configuring alerting rules, or else it will lead to alert fatigue. Alert fatigue creates a tendency among team members to ignore important alerts.</p>
			<p>The next topic discusses <em class="italic">primary versus secondary on call rotation</em>, one of the key factors in implementing the <em class="italic">on call</em> process.</p>
			<h3>Primary versus secondary on call rotation</h3>
			<p>There could be multiple SRE teams that are on call at a given time. Given that the key responsibility <a id="_idIndexMarker483"/>of the on call SRE team is to reliably run the service by tackling both paging and non-paging events <a id="_idIndexMarker484"/>that include handling alerts, tickets, and operational duties, it is often common to divide the SRE teams into primary and secondary teams. </p>
			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker485"/>division into primary and secondary teams essentially helps to distribute duties and organize priorities. The distribution of duties between the teams can differ from the way an organization implements SRE. One implementation is to deploy the secondary team as a fall-through for the pages that the primary on call teams cannot get to, potentially because the primary on call team is actively engaged. Essentially, the secondary team is used as a contingency to the primary team in situations where there are more paging events than the primary team can handle at that moment. Another implementation is to assign the primary on call team to always work on paging events while the secondary on call team can work on non-paging production activities.</p>
			<p>The next topic discusses <em class="italic">single-site versus multi-site production teams</em>, one of the key factors in implementing the <em class="italic">on call</em> process.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>Single-site versus multi-site production teams</h2>
			<p>A single-site production team refers to one or more SRE teams supporting operations from <a id="_idIndexMarker486"/>a single location. Though it's easy for the teams to communicate and exchange information, the challenge is that specific teams have to be engaged during night shifts, which <a id="_idIndexMarker487"/>could be detrimental in the long term from a health standpoint.</p>
			<p>A multi-site <a id="_idIndexMarker488"/>production team refers to one or more SRE teams supporting operations from multiple locations. The typical approach is to ensure the locations are in geographically different regions with a <em class="italic">follow-the sun</em> rotation model that allows the teams to completely avoid night shifts.</p>
			<p>The <em class="italic">follow-the-sun</em> rotational model is a common term used to represent a service and support methodology where a user-facing application is supported by multiple teams that are spread across the world to provide 24/7 support rather than forcing a single support team at a specific location to work overtime till the issue is resolved. In the case of this model, if an outstanding issue is not resolved beyond the shift time of a specific team, then the issue will be transitioned to the team that will handle the next shift, along with the detailed analysis and steps taken by the prior team. The downsides of a multi-site production team include communication challenges and co-ordination overhead.</p>
			<p>The next topic discusses the recommended practices while being on call.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor098"/>Recommended practices while being on call</h2>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker489"/>are some SRE recommended practices while being on call:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Dealing while being on call is all about the approach. While the thinking needs to be rational and focused, there is a risk that the actions can be intuitive and heuristic. Such a risk should be avoided.</li>
				<li>Intuitive actions can often be wrong and are less supported by data. Intuition can lead the on call SREs (SRE engineers) to pursue a line of reasoning that is incorrect from the start and could potentially waste time.</li>
				<li>A heuristic approach creates a tendency where on call SREs can take an approach based on assumptions and previous occurrences, but the approach might not be optimal or rational in nature.</li>
				<li>The most important facets while being on call are to have a clear escalation path, a well-defined incident management procedure, and a blameless postmortem culture, and to strike a balance between <em class="italic">operational overload</em> and <em class="italic">operational underload</em>.         </li>
				<li>Develop a culture of effective troubleshooting by trying to fundamentally understand how a system is built, designed, and supposed to work. Such expertise can be gained by investigating when a system doesn't work. In addition, there should be a constant focus on asking questions, with constructs such as <em class="italic">what</em>, <em class="italic">where</em>, <em class="italic">why</em>, and <em class="italic">how</em> that could potentially lead to the next set of connected questions or answers and eventually help to troubleshoot an issue.</li>
				<li>Avoid <a id="_idIndexMarker490"/>common pitfalls such as focusing on symptoms that aren't relevant, a lack of understanding about the impact of a misconfiguration, and attempting to map a problem to other problems in the past by drawing correlations or using assumptions that are inaccurate.<p class="callout-heading">Operational overload versus operational underload</p><p class="callout">Operational overload is <a id="_idIndexMarker491"/>a state that <a id="_idIndexMarker492"/>is caused by a misconfigured <a id="_idIndexMarker493"/>monitoring system or incorrect choice of alerting rules, leading to fatigue and stress. This typically leads to an increase in ticket count, pages, and ongoing operational support. Handling high-priority tickets and pages leads to tense situations, causing stress, and could also restrict a Site Reliability Engineer's ability to continue working on their engineering engagements. Such situations can be eased by temporarily loaning an experienced SRE to an overloaded team as dedicated help, providing breathing space to teams to allow them to address issues or allow the team member to focus on engineering projects.</p><p class="callout">Operational underload is a state where a Site Reliability Engineer is not involved with a production <a id="_idIndexMarker494"/>system for a long period of time. This could create significant knowledge gaps and a lack of confidence while suddenly dealing with a production issue. This can be avoided if SRE teams are sized such that every engineer is on call at least once or twice in a quarter.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This completes <a id="_idIndexMarker495"/>the section on the process related to being on call, factors that could have an impact while implementing the process, and recommended best practices. The next section focuses on the cultural SRE practices of psychological safety and factors to achieve the same.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor099"/>Psychological safety</h1>
			<p>One of the key pillars of SRE is to accept failure as normal. This implies that failures are imminent, but the <a id="_idIndexMarker496"/>key is to learn from the failures and ensure that the same mistake is not repeated the next time. As a result, SRE promotes open communication within teams and between members of the team and its leaders to ensure that a failure is evaluated objectively from a process standpoint and not from an individual standpoint. The core idea is to provide a sense of psychological safety, which is extremely important to implement the practice of <strong class="bold">Blameless Postmortems</strong>.</p>
			<p>SRE defines psychological safety as the belief that a manager or an individual contributor will not be singled out, humiliated, ridiculed or punished for the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Committing a mistake that could result in a potential incident or a problem</li>
				<li>Bringing up a concern related to a decision with respect to design, implementation, or process that could later have adverse impacts</li>
				<li>Asking questions for further clarifications that could help the individual or multiple members of the team to effectively implement or collaborate</li>
				<li>Coming up with newer ideas that could foster innovation for further improvement of a process or service<p class="callout-heading">Disadvantages of low psychological safety</p><p class="callout">A workplace or a team with low psychological safety will eventually suppress learning and innovation. Team members will be apprehensive about clarifying or speaking out or initiating a conversation. It creates a sense of self-doubt and impacts the exchanging of ideas that could lead to innovation.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Psychological safety <a id="_idIndexMarker497"/>is also important in incident management. In the following topic, we will discuss some factors to ensure psychological safety.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>Factors to overcome in order to foster psychological safety</h2>
			<p>A thought <a id="_idIndexMarker498"/>process of blamelessness promotes psychological safety, and the following two factors should be overcome to avoid blame in the first place: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Hindsight bias</strong>: Refers to a know-it-all attitude that something will eventually fail even though it was not obvious at that point of time. As a result, there is a tendency to blame the person leading the effort that the required actions were not taken to foresee the issue and avoid the failure.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Discomfort discharge</strong>: Refers to a tendency where people blame to discharge discomfort. This leads to a tendency where team members tend to conceal information, facts, or not communicate because of a fear of punishment or consequences that could negatively impact the individual or the team.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To conclude, psychological safety is critical to allow team members to have the freedom to take or make decisions based on the best possible information available at that point in time. In addition, and more often than not, innovation always includes a need to take risks, which also means there is a chance of failure. In either case, if something goes wrong, the focus needs to be on the process leading to the failure but not on the people involved during the incident. This allows for an objective analysis and provides freedom for the team to express their thoughts without hesitation, leading to open communication and continuous improvement.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Head, heart, and feet model</p>
			<p class="callout">The head, heart, and feet model is a way to promote psychological safety from the fear of adopting a change. The head represents the rational, where the emphasis must be on why the change is happening and should include the strategic mission and vision. The heart represents the emotional, where the emphasis should be on how change can bring in a positive impact. The feet represent the behavioral, where the emphasis should be on the knowledge, skills, and resources that should be provided to implement change successfully.</p>
			<p>The next <a id="_idIndexMarker499"/>section deep-dives into another set of SRE cultural practices that promotes sharing vision and knowledge and fostering collaboration.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-102"><a id="_idTextAnchor101"/>Sharing vision and knowledge and fostering collaboration</h1>
			<p>One of the key <a id="_idIndexMarker500"/>pillars of SRE is to reduce organizational <a id="_idIndexMarker501"/>silos, and this can be achieved by creating <a id="_idIndexMarker502"/>a unified vision, sharing knowledge, and fostering collaboration.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor102"/>Unified vision</h2>
			<p>Organizations <a id="_idIndexMarker503"/>have a vision statement that serves as a guide for the work they do or represent. A team's vision should be in line with the organization's vision and typically this vision will have the following constructs:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Core values</strong>: Helps teams to build trust and psychological safety, creates a willingness to take risks and be open to learn.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Purpose</strong>: Refers to the specific intent for the existence of the team.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Mission</strong>: Points to a clear and compelling goal that the team strives to achieve.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Strategy</strong>: Refers to the path to realize or achieve team's mission; this includes the process to identify relevant resources, capabilities, threats, and opportunities.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Goals</strong>: Refers to a defined set of team's objectives. SRE recommends the use of OKRs to set ambitious goals with a drive to accomplish more than possible; <strong class="bold">OKRs</strong> refer to <strong class="bold">objective and key results</strong>, a collaborative goal-setting framework that is used by individuals and teams to aim for ambitious goals and measure results during the process.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>OKRs can enable teams to focus on big bets and accomplish more than the team thought was possible, even if they don't fully attain their intended goal. This is accomplished by clearly defining an objective and also classifying key results quantitatively to ensure that the objective is achieved. The objective of setting OKRs is to set a minimum of those defined key results (if not all). OKRs can encourage people to try new things, prioritize work, and learn from both successes and failures. While the team may not reach every OKR, it gives them something to strive for together, driving toward a unified vision.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/>Communication and collaboration</h2>
			<p>Communication and collaboration between teams is critical to implementing SRE. This could include <a id="_idIndexMarker504"/>the communication between multiple SRE teams within the organization or communication between SRE teams and their respective product/development team. This leads to identifying common approaches to solve problems that might have common elements, remove ambiguity, and provides the possibility to solve more complex challenges. The following are some options proposed by the SRE team.</p>
			<h3>Service-oriented meetings</h3>
			<p>Let's <a id="_idIndexMarker505"/>understand what these meetings are for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>These are mandatory meetings that are meant to review the state of service and increase awareness among all possible stakeholders.</li>
				<li>The recommended duration is about 30-60 minutes and should be driven by a designated lead with a clearly defined agenda.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Next, we will discuss team composition.</p>
			<h3>Effective team composition</h3>
			<p>Let's see <a id="_idIndexMarker506"/>how effective team composition is achieved:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>SRE recommends that every SRE team should have an effective team composition – specifically on certain roles such as Technical Lead, Manager, and Project Manager.</li>
				<li>A Technical Lead sets the technical direction of the team. A manager runs the team's performance management and is the first point of contact for the team. A Project Manager comments on design documentation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Another approach for communication and collaboration is knowledge sharing.</p>
			<h3>Knowledge sharing</h3>
			<p>Here's <a id="_idIndexMarker507"/>what this approach entails:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Cross-training, an employee-to-employee network, and job shadowing are the most recommended options.</li>
				<li>Cross-training allows you to increase competencies of a team member by training in other competencies, thus encouraging employees to constantly learn and grow.</li>
				<li>An employee-to-employee network encourages employees to share their knowledge and learning by driving information sessions internally.</li>
				<li>Job shadowing refers to on-the-job training by observing and potentially helping personnel in their area of expertise.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This completes the final section on a key SRE cultural practice that focuses on sharing a unified vision and knowledge, and fostering communication and collaboration. This also brings us to the end of this chapter.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor104"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we discussed the key elements that are required to build an SRE team. In addition, we discussed key cultural practices that help to implement the technical practices. This concludes the first section of the book focussed on SRE (<em class="italic">Chapters 1-4</em>). The next set of chapters (<em class="italic">Chapters 5-10</em>) will focus on the core Google Cloud services required to implement DevOps, starting with <a href="B15587_05_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Source Code using Cloud Source Repositories.</em></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-106"><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/>Points to remember</h1>
			<p>The following are some important points to remember:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>IC: In charge of the incident response, designates responsibilities and optionally takes on roles that were not designated, such as CL.</li>
				<li>OL: Deals with resolving or handling the incident – technical and tactical; executes the action plan by working with a Primary and Secondary Responder.</li>
				<li>CL: The public face of incident response; responsible for communicating to all the stakeholders.</li>
				<li>PL: Tracks system changes, identifies long-term changes by filing bugs, and arranges hand-offs. </li>
				<li>Command post: Refers to a meeting room or Slack channel where communication happens.</li>
				<li>Live incident state document: Maintained by the CL about the incident and updates, and is later used for the postmortem.</li>
				<li>An incident or outage should be called if specific expertise is needed, if the outage is visible, or if the issue is not resolved after an hour or so of effort.</li>
				<li>Factors to overcome in order to foster psychological safety: hindsight bias and discomfort discharge.</li>
				<li>A team's vision is everything about what drives its work and includes the core values, purpose, mission, strategy, and goals.</li>
				<li>A team's mission is a clear and compelling goal that it wants to achieve.</li>
