- en: The core focus of this section is to deep dive into Google Cloud services that
    are critical to manage source code using Cloud Source Repositories, build code
    and create build artifacts, push artifacts to a registry, deploy the artifacts
    as containerized applications, orchestrate these applications in a cluster through
    managed compute services, secure the clusters, and finally, implement observability
    on the deployed applications through a suite of services focused on operations.

- en: The section introduces key features around each of the core services along with
    hands-on labs as needed. All the labs throughout the section are connected, to
    provide a holistic understanding. The section concludes with SLO monitoring, a
    feature in Cloud Operations that allows tracking SRE technical practices for an
    application deployed to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
