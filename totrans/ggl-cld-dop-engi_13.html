			<p>This book is a practical guide to learning about and understanding <strong class="bold">site reliability engineering</strong> or <strong class="bold">SRE</strong>, which is a prescriptive way of implementing DevOps. The book also provides deep insights into the Google Cloud services that are critical to implementing DevOps on Google Cloud Platform.</p>
			<p>Additionally, the book also helps in preparing for the Professional Cloud DevOps Engineer Certification exam. A professional Cloud DevOps engineer is responsible for efficient development operations and balancing service reliability and delivery speed. They are skilled at using Google Cloud Platform to build software delivery pipelines, deploy and monitor services, and manage and learn from incidents. The official exam guide can be found at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/cloud-devops-engineer">https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/cloud-devops-engineer</a>. To register for the certification exam, go to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/certification/register">https://cloud.google.com/certification/register</a>.</p>
			<p>At a high level, the certification is centered around SRE, <strong class="bold">Google Kubernetes Engine</strong> (<strong class="bold">GKE</strong>), and Google Cloud's operations suite. These topics probably make up more than 80% of the certification exam. The chapters on SRE, GKE, and Google Cloud's operations suite extensively cover key concepts assessed in the Professional Cloud DevOps Engineer Certification exam. The <em class="italic">Points to remember</em> section and the practice test toward the end of this chapter should help you revise the critical concepts from this chapter. </p>
			<p>In addition, three additional topics that might come up on the certification exam will be covered at a high level. Some of these topics overlap with other certification exams from Google, such as Professional Cloud Architect Certification or Professional Cloud Developer Certification.</p>
			<p>The following are the topics that will be summarized. Please note that these topics are not completely elaborated on here but rather only introduced. It is recommended to refer to the specific documentation on these topics for in-depth information:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Cloud Deployment Manager</li>
				<li>Cloud Tasks</li>
				<li>Spinnaker</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-254"><a id="_idTextAnchor254"/>Cloud Deployment Manager</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Infrastructure as Code</strong> (<strong class="bold">IaC</strong>) is the process of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code instead of manually creating the required resources. <strong class="bold">Cloud Deployment Manager</strong> is a Google Cloud service that provides IaC. Cloud Deployment Manager can create a set of Google Cloud resources and facilitates managing these resources as a unit otherwise called a deployment. For example, it is possible to create a <strong class="bold">Virtual Private Cloud</strong> (<strong class="bold">VPC</strong>) using declarative code through a configuration file rather than manually creating it through the console. The following are some critical properties of Cloud Deployment Manager:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Can create multiple resources in parallel, such as multiple VMs</li>
				<li>Can provide input variables to create a resource with specific user-defined values as required</li>
				<li>Can get the return value of a newly created resource, such as the instance ID of a newly created Google Compute Engine instance</li>
				<li>Can create dependencies where one resource definition can reference another resource and one resource can be created after creating another resource (using <strong class="source-inline">dependsOn</strong>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Cloud Deployment Manager allows specifying all the resources required for an application through a configuration file. This is the first step for implementing Cloud Deployment Manager. This configuration file is written in a declarative format using YAML.</p>
			<p>Each configuration file can be used to define one or more resources. Each resource section consists of three main components: the name of the resource, the resource type, and the resource properties. The resource properties that need to be used are in most cases specific to the resource type. The resources specified in the configuration file are created by making API calls (which could introduce a slight risk as certain APIs could be deprecated in the future). The configuration file can either be completely spelled out or Cloud Deployment Manager allows the usage of templates (which are preferred for creating similar types of resources).</p>
			<p>A configuration can contain templates that refer to parts of the configuration file that is abstracted to individual building blocks. A template file is written in either Python or Jinja2. Python templates are more powerful and provide the option to programmatically create or manage templates. Jinja2 is a simpler but less powerful templating language that uses the same syntax as YAML. A preview mode (using the <strong class="source-inline">--preview</strong> flag) can be used to verify the potential operations on the resources before they are applied.

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-255"><a id="_idTextAnchor255"/>Cloud Tasks</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Cloud Tasks</strong> is a fully managed service from Google Cloud that allows you to separate out pieces of work that could be performed independently and asynchronously outside of a user or a service-to-service request. An independent piece of work is referred to as a task. Cloud Tasks is essentially used when an application accepts inputs from users and needs to initiate background tasks accordingly to perform automated asynchronous execution.</p>
			<p>The following is a summary of the critical features of Cloud Tasks:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Cloud Tasks is aimed at explicit invocation, where the publisher retains full control of execution.</li>
				<li>Cloud Tasks is most appropriate where the task producer can have control over the execution.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The core difference between Cloud Tasks and Pub/Sub is the notion of explicit versus implicit invocation. As mentioned, Cloud Tasks is aimed at explicit invocation. In contrast, Pub/Sub supports implicit invocation, where a publisher implicitly causes the subscriber to execute by publishing an event. For more in-depth information on Cloud Tasks, refer to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tasks">https://cloud.google.com/tasks</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-256"><a id="_idTextAnchor256"/>Spinnaker</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Spinnaker</strong> is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform that was initially developed by Netflix and later extended by Google. Spinnaker is not an official Google Cloud service. Spinnaker is not a natively integrated service, and no such native service exists yet from Google Cloud Platform for continuous deployment. Spinnaker is extensively recommended by Google to implement CI/CD pipelines on Google Cloud Platform. Spinnaker helps to release software changes at high velocity and with confidence. Spinnaker is composed of several independent microservices. Spinnaker creates a Cloud Storage bucket and uses a Redis database to maintain its assets. Spinnaker also creates a Pub/Sub topic.</p>
			<p>Spinnaker can be considered an application management tool where it is possible to view and manage GKE components, including workload resources, services, and load balancers. Spinnaker can support multiple deployment models, including rolling update, blue/green, or canary.</p>
			<p>Spinnaker puts everything in an auto-pilot mode where there is no need for manual intervention, or in other words, no need to manually execute <strong class="source-inline">kubectl</strong> commands. Spinnaker can create and manage YAML files and can perform automated deployments or even create/execute YAML files for load balancers as a service. The only manual step involved is to provide approval to complete deployment.</p>
			<p>The following figure shows a high-level summary in terms of interactions specifically when Spinnaker is used to deploy to a GKE cluster:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Illustration of interactions when Spinnaker is used to deploy to GKE</p>
			<p>The interactions in the preceding figure are as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The developer changes the code by creating a Git tag and pushes to the cloud source repository.</li>
				<li>The cloud source repository is configured to detect the new Git tag. This triggers Cloud Build to execute the build process as per the provided specification. This might include the running of unit tests. Once complete, a build artifact such as a Docker image is created.</li>
				<li>The created build artifact is stored either in Container Registry or Artifact Registry and once available, a message is sent to Cloud Pub/Sub if configured.</li>
				<li>Spinnaker, installed on GKE, will be listening to a Pub/Sub topic for the newly created image.</li>
				<li>Once the image is available, Spinnaker deploys the new container to a QA/staging environment, preferably through canary deployment so that only a small set of users are impacted.</li>
				<li>Functional tests are run on the canary environment if available to verify the quality of the deployment. If the deployment is as per the expected standards in terms of quality, then after manual approval, the image is then deployed to the production environment.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is important to note that either while performing a blue/green deployment or a canary deployment, Spinnaker can update the ReplicaSet in place. When deploying a ReplicaSet with a Deployment, and the Deployment doesn't exist, Spinnaker first creates the ReplicaSet with <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> replicas and then creates the Deployment, which will resize the ReplicaSet. When the Deployment does exist, it does the same but edits the Deployment in place rather than creating it.</p>

			<p>This concludes our summary of additional topics such as Cloud Deployment Manager, Cloud Tasks, and Spinnaker.</p>
