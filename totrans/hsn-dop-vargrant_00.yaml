- en: Vagrant is an open source tool that allows you to programatically create and
    manage virtual environments. Vagrant's main focus is on creating development environments
    that can be shared between teams all over the world. It removes the "works fine
    on my machine" problem and allows anyone with the Vagrantfile configuration to
    create an exact copy of the original machine.
