<p class="calibre2">VirtualBox is a very important piece of software, which we refer to as a <strong class="calibre4">provider</strong>. Its job is to do the heavy lifting in creating and maintaining virtual machines and environments. Vagrant is essentially a wrapper around a provider (in our case, VirtualBox) and exposes a powerful API that allows you to create and manage virtual machines through code and configuration, such as the Vagrantfile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once VirtualBox is installed, we will have very little to do with it. It will sit in the background and await commands from Vagrant to manage virtual machines.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this chapter, we will start to get our hands dirty with Vagrant. We will look at the following topics:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11">Finding the version of your OS</li>
<li class="calibre11">Finding your CPU architecture</li>
<li class="calibre11">Installing VirtualBox on Windows, Linux, and macOS</li>
<li class="calibre11">Installing Vagrant on Windows, Linux, and macOS</li>
<li class="calibre11">Running Vagrant via the command line/Terminal to see which version of Vagrant you have</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">By the end of this chapter, you will have a fully working Vagrant and VirtualBox, ready to start creating virtual environments.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Finding out which version of Windows you are running will help when choosing which package installer to download. Each version of Windows is different, but we will be covering how to do this using Windows 10.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are two ways you can do this; the first is a fairly quick and simple way using the Command Prompt in Windows:</p>
<ol class="calibre13">
<li value="1" class="calibre11">Press the Windows key + the <em class="calibre18">R</em> key (or click Start and search for <kbd class="calibre12">run</kbd>)</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre11">This will open a prompt in this prompt, type <kbd class="calibre12">winver</kbd></li>
<li value="3" class="calibre11">Press the <em class="calibre18">Enter</em> key and you should see a new <kbd class="calibre12">About Windows</kbd> screen pop up with all of your OS information</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre2">The second way requires a bit more effort, but can be achieved through the Windows graphical user interface:</p>
<ol class="calibre13">
<li value="1" class="calibre11"><span>Go into the Windows settings and click <span>About</span></span></li>
<li value="2" class="calibre11">You can access the system settings by clicking on the cog in the taskbar or by typing <kbd class="calibre12">settings</kbd> in the taskbar</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre11">In the <kbd class="calibre12">About</kbd> screen, you will see a section titled <span>Windows specifications</span></li>
<li value="4" class="calibre11">In this section, the part we need to focus on is the <span>Edit</span> value</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre11">The value is <kbd class="calibre12">Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation</kbd></li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre2"/>

<p class="calibre2">A system's CPU architecture is generally 32-bit or 64-bit. When you download the VirtualBox or Vagrant software package-installer, you will have to define which version you require. </p>
<p class="calibre2">To find out the CPU architecture for a Windows 10 system, follow these steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre13">
<li value="1" class="calibre11"><span>Go into the Windows settings and click <span>About</span></span></li>

<li value="4" class="calibre11">In this section, the part we need to focus on is the <span>System type</span> value</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre11">The value is <kbd class="calibre12">64-bit operating system, <span>x64-based </span><span>processor</span></kbd></li>

            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">Before diving into this section, it's worth mentioning that version 1.8 and later of Vagrant will automatically install VirtualBox onto your system to offer a smoother experience. You can skip this section and move onto the next section, titled <em class="calibre16">Installing Vagrant on Windows 10</em>. If you have any issues, please feel free to come back to this section and try to manually install VirtualBox.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before we install Vagrant, it's wise to install its provider, VirtualBox. To get started, you will need to visit the official VirtualBox website, <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" class="calibre9">https://www.virtualbox.org/</a>. The best way would be to use your system's internet browser, such as Internet Explorer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Follow the steps for installation:</p>
<ol class="calibre13">
<li value="1" class="calibre11">Click on the <span>Downloads</span> link found in the menu on the left side. We're going to focus on the latest version (at the time of writing, this was version 5.2.10). </li>
<li value="2" class="calibre11"><span>Underneath this section, you should see a list of four <span>platform packages</span> links.</span></li>
<li value="3" class="calibre11"><span>Click on the <span>Windows hosts</span> options. You will be prompted to select a version, such as x86 (32-bit CPU) or AMD64 (64-bit CPU). If this is the case, use the information from <span>About (CPU Architecture)</span> and download the appropriate package.</span></li>
<li value="4" class="calibre11">When you click on the package, your browser should start the download automatically. Choose <span>Run</span> to start the installation immediately after the download completes. You'll be presented with a welcome screen after the installer starts.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5" class="calibre13">
<li value="5" class="calibre11">Click on the <span>Next</span> button to continue.</li>
<li value="6" class="calibre11">To keep things simple, we will stay with the default configuration. This is an opportunity for you to make changes if you so require. This might be as simple as changing the installation location. When you are ready, click on the <span>Next</span> button to continue.</li>
<li value="7" class="calibre11">You should see another screen with customization options. For the sake of simplicity, we will leave all options checked.</li>
<li value="8" class="calibre11">Click <span>Next</span> to continue.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre2">At this stage, you will see a large red <kbd class="calibre12">Warning</kbd> message. Do not be alarmed, this is normal behavior for the installation. The installer simply needs to temporarily disable and restart the network services on your machine. This will affect anything you are currently doing that requires an internet connection, such as downloading or streaming:</p>
<ol class="calibre13">
<li value="1" class="calibre11">When you are ready, click <span>Yes</span> to continue to the next screen.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre11">This is your final opportunity to make any changes before the VirtualBox software is installed on your system. If you are happy to proceed, click on the <span>Install</span> button to continue.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre11">Depending on your <span>User Access Control</span> security settings, Windows may ask you to confirm the installation. Click <span>Yes</span> to allow the software installer to continue.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre11">The installation will begin. If you need to cancel for any reason, simply click on the <span>Cancel</span> button.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre11">The installation should be complete. I would recommend leaving the <span>Start Oracle VM VirtualBox 5.2.10 after installation</span> box checked as this will allow you to see the VirtualBox software start. Click on the <span>Finish</span> button to continue.</li>
<li value="6" class="calibre11">You should see an <span>Oracle VM VirtualBox</span> shortcut on your desktop (if you left that option ticked during the installation stage). You can open VirtualBox by clicking on that shortcut, or you can use the search bar by typing <kbd class="calibre12">virtualbox</kbd> and clicking on the result.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre2">After completion, you'll be presented with the screen pertaining to the default installation. Congratulations on completing this step. We will now finish off by installing Vagrant.</p>

<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre6">It's time to install Vagrant. The following steps are for the installation of Vagrant:<br class="calibre5"/></span></p>
<ol class="calibre13">
<li value="1" class="calibre11"><span>Visit the official Vagrant website, <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" class="calibre9">https://www.vagrantup.com/</a></span><span>. The best way would be to use your system's internet bro</span>wser, such as Firefox. We will stick with the most current, up-to-date version of Vagrant.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" class="calibre13">
<li value="2" class="calibre11">Click on the <span>Download 2.0.4</span> link or the <span>Download</span> link in the top navigation menu. You should see the downloads page.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre11">We can focus on the Windows section, but you will need to choose either the 32-bit or 64-bit option, depending on your system. My system is a 64-bit one, so I will be choosing that option. The download should start automatically. </li>
<li value="4" class="calibre11"><span>Choose <span>Run</span>, which will download the software and start the installer automatically.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre2">Once the download has finished, the installer should start. You'll be presented with the welcome screen of the installer:</p>
<ol class="calibre13">
<li value="1" class="calibre11">Click on the <span>Next</span> button to continue.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre11">Once you have read the terms and conditions, if you are happy and agree, then tick the option. Click the <span>Next</span> button to continue.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre11">You can change the installation destination if required. When you are happy, click the <span>Next</span> button to continue to the next screen.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre11">You have the option to make any changes before Vagrant is installed onto your system. If you don't want to make any more changes, click on the <span>Install</span> button.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre11">The Windows UAC will ask you whether you are happy to allow the installer to continue. Click on the <span>Yes</span> button.</li>
<li value="6" class="calibre11">Vagrant will start the installation. If you need to cancel for any reason, click on the <span>Cancel</span> button.</li>
<li value="7" class="calibre11">After the successful installation of Vagrant, click on the <span>Finish</span> button to close the installer.</li>
<li value="8" class="calibre11">You must restart your system for Vagrant to be fully installed on your system.</li>
<li value="9" class="calibre11">Click on the <span>Yes</span> button to restart. This will disturb any work you currently have on your system, so make sure you make any saves required.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="10" class="calibre13">
<li value="10" class="calibre11">To verify that Vagrant has been installed and that it is running, we will need to use the Command Prompt. To access this, search for <kbd class="calibre12">cmd</kbd> using the search facility on your system:</li>
</ol>
<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img class="alignnone1" src="../images/00005.gif"/></div>
<ol start="11" class="calibre13">
<li value="11" class="calibre11">Run the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant -v</kbd> command by typing it out and pressing <em class="calibre18">Enter</em>. You should see an output similar to the preceding screenshot. My Vagrant version is <kbd class="calibre12">2.0.4</kbd>. </li>

<p class="calibre2">In this section, you will learn how to install VirtualBox and Vagrant onto a macOS environment. You will learn how to find out what your CPU architecture is and what version of the Mac operating system you are running. In this section, we will be using macOS High Sierra 10.13.3 64-bit as our example operating system and computer setup.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Before we install VirtualBox and Vagrant, we need to learn some basic information about your system. This is information required to help you select which package to download.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Finding out what version of macOS you are running will help you choose which package installer to download. </p>
<p class="calibre2">One of the easiest and quickest ways to find out system information for Mac is to run the <kbd class="calibre12">sw_vers</kbd> command in the Terminal:</p>
<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img src="../images/00007.jpeg" class="calibre19"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">There are two key values here we can focus on:  <kbd class="calibre12">ProductName</kbd>, which is <kbd class="calibre12">Mac OS X</kbd>; and <kbd class="calibre12">ProductVersion</kbd>, which is <kbd class="calibre12">10.13.3</kbd>.</p>

<p class="calibre2">A system's CPU architecture is generally 32-bit or 64-bit. When you download the VirtualBox or Vagrant software package-installer, you will have to define which version you require. </p>
<p class="calibre2">We can run the <kbd class="calibre12">sysctl hw.cpu64bit_capable</kbd> command, which lets us know whether our system is capable of running 64-bit software. In this screenshot of my system, you can see the returned value is <kbd class="calibre12">1</kbd>:</p>
<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img src="../images/00008.jpeg" class="calibre20"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">This means that I have a 64-bit-capable Mac system. If your value returns as empty or <kbd class="calibre12">0</kbd>, then your system only supports 32-bit.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Before diving into this section, it's worth mentioning that version 1.8 and later of Vagrant will automatically install VirtualBox onto your system to offer a smoother experience. You can skip this section and move onto the next section, titled <em class="calibre16">Installing Vagrant on macOS</em>. If you have any issues, please feel free to come back to this section and try to manually install VirtualBox.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before we install Vagrant, it's wise to install its provider, which is VirtualBox:</p>
<ol class="calibre13">
<li value="1" class="calibre11">Visit the official VirtualBox website, <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" class="calibre9">https://www.virtualbox.org/</a>. The best way would be to use your system's Internet Browser, such as Firefox.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre11">Click on the <span>Downloads</span> link found in the navigation menu on the left-hand side.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" class="calibre13">
<li value="3" class="calibre11">This should load the downloads page of the website. For this book, we will be using VirtualBox version 5.2.10, so please navigate to that section of the page. When presented with the screen, click on the <span>OS X hosts</span> link and this should start the download automatically on your system.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre11">Once the download has finished, click on the <kbd class="calibre12">.dmg</kbd> file to run the VirtualBox installer package. Your Mac system will open and verify the installer. You will see a temporary screen with a few different options. Follow step 1 by clicking and opening the <kbd class="calibre12">VirtualBox.pkg</kbd> file.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre11">The VirtualBox installer will run. Click the <span>Continue</span> button.</li>
<li value="6" class="calibre11">The system has verified that you can install this VirtualBox software. Click on the <span>Continue</span> button to begin the installer process.</li>
<li value="7" class="calibre11">On this next screen, you have the option to change the install location. You may do this as you wish, but for the sake of simplicity and consistency, we will leave it as the default location. If you are happy to proceed, click on the <span>Install</span> button.</li>
<li value="8" class="calibre11">Your system may ask you to log in to allow the installer to continue. Please enter your username (this may already be filled out) and your system password. Then click the <span>Install Software</span> button to continue.</li>
<li value="9" class="calibre11">The installer will install the files and configurations that it requires. If there are no issues during installation, you should see a <kbd class="calibre12">The ivag</kbd></li>
<li value="10" class="calibre11">To verify and run VirtualBox, you can find it in your applications folder and possibly on your desktop. When you open the installer, you should see the VirtualBox default welcome screen.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre6">Congratulations! You have successfully installed VirtualBox on your macOS system.</span></p>

<li value="2" class="calibre11">Click on <span>Download 2.0.4</span> on the homepage or the <span>Download</span> link in the top-right navigation menu. This will load the Vagrant download page.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre11">The current version of Vagrant only supports the 64-bit version of macOS. We will be using that one. Click on the link to start the download.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre11">Once the download has finished, click on the <kbd class="calibre12">.dmg</kbd> file to open the Vagrant installer. The Mac system will open and verify the Vagrant installer.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5" class="calibre13">
<li value="5" class="calibre11">Once the verification has completed, you will see a temporary splash screen. Click on the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant.pkg</kbd> icon to run the installer.</li>
<li value="6" class="calibre11">You should see the <kbd class="calibre12">Introduction</kbd> screen of the installer. Click on the <span>Continue</span> button to start the process.</li>
<li value="7" class="calibre11">You have the option to change Vagrant's installation location.<span>You may do this as you wish, but for the sake of simplicity and consistency, we will leave it as the default location.

</ol>
<p class="calibre2">You may now click on the <span class="calibre6">Close</span> button to close the installer. Vagrant has no graphical user interface, so we can verify that is has been installed by running the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant -v</kbd> command, which should output which version of Vagrant that we are running:</p>
<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img src="../images/00009.jpeg" class="calibre20"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">As you can see from my Terminal output, the macOS system is running Vagrant version <kbd class="calibre12">2.0.4</kbd>. Congratulations! You have successfully installed Vagrant onto your macOS system.</p>
