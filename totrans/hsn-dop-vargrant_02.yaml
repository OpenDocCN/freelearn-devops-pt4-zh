- en: VirtualBox is a very important piece of software, which we refer to as a **provider**.
    Its job is to do the heavy lifting in creating and maintaining virtual machines
    and environments. Vagrant is essentially a wrapper around a provider (in our case,
    VirtualBox) and exposes a powerful API that allows you to create and manage virtual
    machines through code and configuration, such as the Vagrantfile.
