<p class="calibre2">A Vagrant box is a specific package format for containing Vagrant environments. A Vagrant box file uses the <kbd class="calibre12">.box</kbd> file extension. A Vagrant box can be used with any platform and system that Vagrant supports to create the same environment by following the steps in the box file.</p>

<p class="calibre2">A Vagrant box file is made up of three components: box file, box metadata, and box information. These components help package everything you need into one file. Various parts of these components are used by Vagrant when using and installing a new box to create the correct environment. Let's dive into the three components and see what each one does.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">The box contains different information depending on the provider. It is provider-specific and could be in several different formats, such as ZIP, <kbd class="calibre12">tar.gz</kbd>, or TAR. This information is not used by Vagrant but is instead passed on to the provider.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The box catalog metadata is generally used with the Vagrant cloud platform. It contains information such as the box name, different versions, descriptions and different supported providers, and any URLs to specific box files. This metadata is usually stored as a JSON document. The filename would be <kbd class="calibre12">metadata.json</kbd>.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The box information is the extra details that you can add. These extra details are displayed when a user runs the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant box list --box-info</kbd> command. You can set information for the author name/company and a URL. This file is a JSON document and the filename would be <kbd class="calibre12">info.json</kbd>.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">In this section, you will learn how to install a Vagrant box. There are a number of ways that Vagrant boxes can be installed:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11">A URL that points directly to the box file</li>
<li class="calibre11">A shorthand/alias for a public box name, such as <kbd class="calibre12">debian/jessie64</kbd></li>
<li class="calibre11">A file path or URL to a box in a specific catalog</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">Often, the simplest option is to use shorthand as it does not require you to know the full box URL or catalog URL.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When a Vagrant box supports multiple providers, you will be given the option to choose which one you wish to install:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00012.jpeg" class="calibre21"/></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre6">You can also use the</span> <kbd class="calibre12">--provider</kbd> <span class="calibre6">flag to specify which provider version of the box you wish to install. Vagrant offers an easy-to-use option, such as the preceding screenshot, or provides a much more comprehensive utility when using the command line.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">Using this option requires you to know the full URL to a box file and you must use the <kbd class="calibre12">--name</kbd> flag so Vagrant has some reference to the box. This reference helps with updating and versioning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Here is an example of the command: <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant box add --name "mybox" http://www.example.com/boxname.box</kbd>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This command would install the <kbd class="calibre12">boxname.box</kbd> box, giving it the name <kbd class="calibre12">mybox</kbd>, and downloading it from the <kbd class="calibre12">www.example.com</kbd> domain.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">This method is fairly simple and straightforward if you know theshorthand/alias name for the box.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Here is an example of the command: <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant box add debian/jessie64</kbd>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This command will install the 64-bit <em class="calibre16">Jessie</em> version of the Debian OS. You can often find the shorthand/alias box name by searching online via search engines or using the Vagrant Cloud platform.</p>

<p class="calibre2">This method is similar to the first method mentioned in the <em class="calibre16">Direct URL to box file</em> section, where you can use a URL or file path to download and install a box file directly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Here is an example of the command: <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant box add https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/trusty64</kbd>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This command will install the 64-bit <em class="calibre16">Trusty</em> version of Ubuntu. You do not need to use the <kbd class="calibre12">--name</kbd> flag for this method as Vagrant will get this information from the box metadata and box information files.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">At some point, you may need to delete a Vagrant box from your system. There may be a few reasons:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11">To free up system space</li>
<li class="calibre11">To remove a corrupt version</li>
<li class="calibre11">To remove an old version that is no longer required</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">Whatever your reason, in this section, you will learn how to delete Vagrant boxes. Before deleting a box, it's worth getting the correct name/format in case you accidentally delete the wrong box!</p>
<p class="calibre2">To list the available boxes on your system, run the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant box list -i</kbd> command, which will return the installed boxes on your system, their name, their provider, and the latest version. Using the <kbd class="calibre12">-i</kbd> flag will supply an additional description that may help you choose the correct box.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">It is possible to delete a specific version of a Vagrant box without deleting the box entirely from your system. You may do this to free up space from older box versions that you no longer use on your system.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You can run the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant box prune --dry-run</kbd> command to view a list of outdated box version on your system. The output of this command will show you boxes that will be kept (if you choose to run the <kbd class="calibre12">prune</kbd> command) and any boxes that will be removed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Here is the example output of the preceding command:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00013.jpeg" class="calibre22"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">If you wish to remove all outdated boxes from your system, run the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant box prune</kbd> command. </p>
<p class="calibre2">To delete a specific box version, you can run the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant box remove [BOXNAME] --box-version [BOXVERSION]</kbd> command, where the first parameter is the box name and the second is the specific version. Here is the example output:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00014.jpeg" class="calibre23"/></p>

<p class="calibre2">To remove all versions of a Vagrant box, you can run the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant box remove [BOXNAME]</kbd> command, where the first parameter is the box name. When running this command, your terminal will ask for confirmation before deleting the box.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Here is the example output:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00015.jpeg" class="calibre24"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">If, for any reason, you just want to delete the box without confirmation, you can run the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant box remove [BOXNAME] --force</kbd> command, which uses the <kbd class="calibre12">--force</kbd> flag.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">You can access the Vagrant Cloud website by visiting <a href="https://app.vagrantup.com" class="calibre9">https://app.vagrantup.com</a>, although it may redirect you to <a href="https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search" class="calibre9">https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search</a>. </p>
<p class="calibre2">There are currently three different pricing tiers, which offer different features depending on what you need. Here are the three tiers:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11"><strong class="calibre1">Free</strong>: This option provides unlimited public boxes</li>
<li class="calibre11"><strong class="calibre1">Personal</strong>: This option provides unlimited public boxes and an option of $5 per month per private box</li>
<li class="calibre11"><strong class="calibre1">Organization</strong>: This options provides unlimited public boxes, an option of $25 per month per private box, and the ability to share private boxes with teams</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">To choose the right tier, it really depends on your use case and what you wish to use the Vagrant Cloud for. You can start with the free tier and always upgrade if you need to.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">Let's use the search feature to find a box that we can install on our system. The search feature is fairly simple, but does offer a few filters. You can access the search box at <a href="https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search" class="calibre9">https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You should see a section similar to the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre25"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">There are three different options available for searching the Vagrant Cloud:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11">The main text input area in which you can type pretty much anything <span>–</span> the box name, operating system, architecture, and included software.</li>
<li class="calibre11">You can filter by <span>Provider</span>, such as <span>virtualbox</span>, <span>vmare</span>, and docker. If you have no preference, you can choose the <span>any</span> option.</li>
<li class="calibre11">You can also sort the results by <span>Downloads</span> (number of total downloads), <span>Recently Created</span>, and <span>Recently Updated</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">Let's search for a <kbd class="calibre12">Laravel</kbd> (this is a PHP framework) box that supports the VirtualBox provider and let's sort it by <span class="calibre6">Downloads</span>:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre26"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">Let's click on the first result to get more information about that box:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre27"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">There is a wealth of information found on this page, including the box version history. The latest box version is listed by most recent so you should always see the latest one at the top.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first section, titled <em class="calibre16">How to use this box with Vagrant</em>, gives a two basic examples about installing and using this box on your system. The default tab shown is the <span class="calibre6">Vagrantfile</span> one, which shows you three lines that can be added to your <span class="calibre6">Vagrantfile</span>. The second tab, titled <span class="calibre6">New</span>, shows you how to install and run the box using commands in your terminal, you can see that option here:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00019.jpeg" class="calibre28"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">Let's look at version 6.0.0, which is the <em class="calibre16">currently-released version</em>. You can see when this version was created (in our case, it was 20 days ago) and there is a GitHub URL available where you can view the release information for that specific version.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this section, you can also view which providers this version supports and the file size for this box. In our case, we can see that three providers are supported for the 6.0.0 version: <span class="calibre6">hyperv</span>, <span class="calibre6">vmware_desktop</span>, and <span class="calibre6">virtualbox</span>. We can see that the file size for <span class="calibre6">hyperv</span> is <span class="calibre6">1.26 GB</span>, and for <span class="calibre6">vmare_desktop</span> and <span class="calibre6">virtualbox</span> the file size is <span class="calibre6">1.38 GB</span>.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Now that we have found the Vagrant box we want, let's install it and use it on our system. We will use the <kbd class="calibre12">init</kbd> command to create a new <strong class="calibre4">Vagrantfile</strong> and install the box.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First create a new empty directory, move into that directory, and run the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant init laravel/homestead</kbd> command, as described on the Vagrant Cloud website:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00020.jpeg" class="calibre29"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">You should now see a new Vagrantfile in your current directory, run the <kbd class="calibre12">ls</kbd> command to see:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00021.jpeg" class="calibre30"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">Let's look inside the Vagrantfile. I've opened the Vagrantfile using the Atom text editor. Let's focus on the first few lines (not the comments):</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img class="alignnone5" src="../images/00022.jpeg"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">You can see on line number 15 that the <kbd class="calibre12">config.vm.box</kbd> key has been set a value of <kbd class="calibre12">laravel/homestead</kbd>. This is what the <kbd class="calibre12">init</kbd> command does, it creates/initializes a new Vagrantfile and sets a specified value depending on the parameter of the command.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We can now start up the Vagrant box, which will install the <kbd class="calibre12">laravel/homestead</kbd> box. Run the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant up</kbd> command:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00023.jpeg" class="calibre31"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">If you do not have the box installed on your system, it will first have to download the <kbd class="calibre12">.box</kbd> file. The file is approximately 1.38 GB (according to the Vagrant Cloud website for the current version we are trying to download, which is 6.0.0); it may take some time to download depending on your internet connection/speed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once installed, you should see a green success message and the box will start to be imported:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00024.jpeg" class="calibre32"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">Once imported, Vagrant will continue the box initialization, which will configure networking, SSH, and storage mounting. You can start experimenting with the box by connecting via SSH by running the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant ssh</kbd> command:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img class="alignnone6" src="../images/00025.jpeg"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">Let's run a simple command against the Vagrant box to make sure everything is working. Once you've run the <kbd class="calibre12">ssh</kbd> command, run the <kbd class="calibre12">php -v</kbd> command, which will output the PHP version installed on the system. PHP should be installed as that is one of the requirements of the Laravel framework. You should see an output similar to the following:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00026.jpeg" class="calibre33"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">We can see that PHP is installed and the version is <kbd class="calibre12">7.2.4-1</kbd>. If you wish to exit out of the Vagrant box, simply run the <kbd class="calibre12">exit</kbd> command. You can view <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant status</kbd> to view the status of the Vagrant box, the value should be <kbd class="calibre12">virtualbox (running)</kbd>. You can stop the command by running the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant halt</kbd> command:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00027.jpeg" class="calibre34"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">You can now check the status again by running the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant status</kbd> command again:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00028.jpeg" class="calibre35"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">You can see that the status has changed to <kbd class="calibre12">poweroff (virtualbox)</kbd>.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">Before we can upload anything to the Vagrant Cloud platform, we need to create a box. Our Vagrant box will be a repackaged version of the <kbd class="calibre12">ubuntu/xenial64</kbd> base box that can be found on the Vagrant Cloud platform. To keep it simple, we will simply be repackaging this box and uploading it using a different name.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First of all, you will need to make sure you have the <kbd class="calibre12">ubuntu/xenial64</kbd> box installed on your system. You can check this by running the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant box list</kbd> command. You can see that I have it installed on my system as it appears in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00029.jpeg" class="calibre36"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">If you do not have it installed, run the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant box add ubuntu/xenial64</kbd> command to install the box on your system.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let's run the box to make sure it's working correctly. Run the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant init ubuntu/xenial64</kbd> command to generate a basic Vagrantfile and then run the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant up</kbd> command to get the box up and running.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once up and running, you should be able to <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant ssh</kbd> into the machine. Everything should be working, let's now <kbd class="calibre12">exit</kbd> out of the box and run the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant halt</kbd> command to stop the machine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now it's time to set up the Vagrant box in the Vagrant Cloud dashboard. Log into your account and click on the <span class="calibre6">Dashboard</span> button, you should see another button titled <span class="calibre6">New Vagrant Box</span>. Click on that button and you should see the following screen:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00030.jpeg" class="calibre37"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">The name is split into two parts: your username and the box name separated by a slash. My box will be accessible via <kbd class="calibre12">abraunton/alextest</kbd>, but it would be better to use a more descriptive name. You cannot use private mode unless you have a paid account. I would recommend adding in a <span class="calibre6">Short description</span> when possible. Click on the <span class="calibre6">Create box</span> button to continue when you are ready.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We now need to add a version in for this box. Let's start with <kbd class="calibre12">0.0.1</kbd> as this is the very first iteration of our box. You can also add in a <span class="calibre6">Description</span> for this specific version:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img class="alignnone7" src="../images/00031.jpeg"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">Click on the <span class="calibre6">Create version</span> button when you are ready. We now need to add a provider to our Vagrant box. You can do this by clicking the <span class="calibre6">Add a provider</span> button, within your new version:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00032.jpeg" class="calibre38"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">You will now need to choose which provider this box file supports. We will be sticking with VirtualBox in this example and selecting the <span class="calibre6">Upload to Vagrant Cloud</span> option as we wish to directly upload the box file:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00033.jpeg" class="calibre39"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">Before we can continue, we must package the box into a file. You can do this by running the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant package --output alextest.box</kbd> command in the same directory as the box you wish to package:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00034.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">This may take a few minutes, depending on the size of your machine. Once completed, head back to the Vagrant Cloud page and click the <span class="calibre6">Continue to upload</span> button:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00035.jpeg" class="calibre41"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">Choose the file (it must be a <kbd class="calibre12">.box</kbd> file) and the upload should start automatically. This may take some time, depending on your internet speed. When complete, the status should change to <span class="calibre6">Upload Complete</span>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Congratulations! You have successfully created and uploaded a Vagrant box onto the Vagrant Cloud. You can see this by clicking on the <span class="calibre6">Dashboard</span> menu; this will now list any boxes you have added:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00036.jpeg" class="calibre42"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">You can see that under the <span class="calibre6">My Vagrant Boxes</span> section, my <kbd class="calibre12">abraunton/alextest</kbd> box has appeared. It has the description that we added in and it also states that there are <span class="calibre6">No released versions</span>. This means that the box is unavailable for download but we can change that. Click into the box and you should see the following message:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img class="alignnone8" src="../images/00037.jpeg"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">Scroll down and you should see the 0.0.1 version of the box that we have uploaded. Click on the <span class="calibre6">Release...</span> button to start the release process:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00038.jpeg" class="calibre43"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">You will now see a confirmation screen and will be required to click on the <span class="calibre6">Release version</span> button to complete the process:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00039.jpeg" class="calibre44"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">You should now see a green <span class="calibre6">Successfully released</span> message. Congratulations! You have publicly released your first Vagrant box onto the Vagrant Cloud:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img class="alignnone9" src="../images/00040.gif"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">Now for the real test; let's check to make sure our box is available and that we can install and run it on our system. Run the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant init abraunton/alextest --box-version 0.0.1</kbd> command:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00041.jpeg" class="calibre30"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">This will generate a Vagrantfile telling Vagrant to use the <span class="calibre6">abraunton/alextest</span> box and the specific version of 0.0.1. Next, run the <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant up</kbd> command. This will install our box from the Vagrant Cloud and create our environment:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00042.jpeg" class="calibre45"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">If your box is available and has a release, you should be able to successfully download it. If all goes well, you should see this green message in your terminal:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img src="../images/00043.jpeg" class="calibre46"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Vagrant box should now be up and running, let's <kbd class="calibre12">vagrant ssh</kbd> into the box and see what we get. Upon SSHing in, you should see the Ubuntu welcome message. That's correct, as we repackaged an Ubuntu box:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img class="alignnone10" src="../images/00044.jpeg"/></p>
<p class="calibre2">Congratulations! You have successfully installed and run your Vagrant box from the Vagrant cloud. You may now stop the machine, remove the box, or experiment with it. Have fun!</p>

<p class="calibre2">If you are looking for a more enterprise solution for hosting and managing your boxes, there are services available to you.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These services offer products and features such as the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11">Box-hosting</li>
<li class="calibre11">Box versioning</li>
<li class="calibre11">Private box access and security</li>
<li class="calibre11">Local repositories for offline box access</li>
<li class="calibre11">Advanced/smart search</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">An example of this type of service is <strong class="calibre4">Artifactory</strong>, which is developed by JFrog. Artifactory is a binary artifact-management tool. Artifactory allows you to host, manage, and version Vagrant boxes in a secure manner. Their focus on security often appeals to enterprise customers who may need to host sensitive data.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Artifactory offers a type of onsite hosting by using local repositories. It still allows you to share access between employees and teams within your organization. These repositories can be cloned to other Artifactory services if access needs to be shared outside local networks. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Depending on your requirements and company rules, a solution such as this may be worth looking into. The Vagrant Cloud is an excellent service to consider as well.</p>

<p class="calibre2">In this chapter, we covered many aspects of Vagrant boxes. We learned what a Vagrant box is, what forms a box, how to install a box, how to delete a box, box versioning, and we created our own (repackaged) box and uploaded it to the Vagrant Cloud. We then installed that box from the Vagrant Cloud and tested it on our system.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In <span class="calibre6"><a href="part0158.html#4MLOS0-d86fec2f29de42f086efd11bc5538d9c" class="calibre9">Chapter 5</a>,</span> <em class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Configuring Vagrant Using a Vagrantfile</span></em>, we will focus on the Vagrantfile. We have briefly mentioned this file but we have not used it to its full potential yet. The Vagrantfile is used to configure Vagrant and offers a very powerful but easy-to-use syntax. You will learn how to create a Vagrantfile, how to validate one, and the syntax it uses.</p>
