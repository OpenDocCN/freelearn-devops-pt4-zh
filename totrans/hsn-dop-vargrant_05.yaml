    simply run the `vagrant up` command to pull in any dependencies, such as boxes,
    and to set up any configuration to get the same Vagrant environment up and running
    as you.

    In most cases you will simply be setting a variable and a value, such as `config.vm.box
    = "ubuntu/trusty64"` , which sets the box to `ubuntu/trusty64`, the 64-bit version
