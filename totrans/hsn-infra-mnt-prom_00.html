<p class="mce-root">This book about Prometheus, the second project to graduate within the <strong>Cloud Native Computing Foundation</strong> (<strong>CNCF</strong>), will help you to crystallize the core fundamentals of monitoring and the approaches <span>available </span>to ensure the required <span>infrastructure </span>visibility. It relies on practical examples, using test environments and diagrams, to communicate knowledge in an easy-to-digest manner.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The content was designed to ensure that all the important Prometheus stack <span>concepts</span> are tackled. Our main goal during the writing process was to aim the book at our past selves and ensure that they would have everything they needed to know about this technology in this book.</p>
<p class="mce-root">From running one Prometheus server, to what scaling options are available, from creating and testing alerting rules, to templating slack notifications; and from useful dashboards, to automating target discovery; many other topics will be explained to ensure a full knowledge base on infrastructure monitoring using Prometheus as its cornerstone.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Basic knowledge of monitoring, networking, and containers is useful but is not mandatory.</p>
<p class="mce-root">All the test environments were validated using macOS and Linux, while enforcing specific software versions for added compatibility, so those are the best candidates to guarantee you won't run into issues. <a href="8f575e82-4713-45c7-8eb3-0af3e0e61ed3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Setting Up a Test Environment</em>, provides all the technical information on this subject.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Decent internet connectivity is required to download the software dependencies, as is a modern browser to ensure access to all the web interfaces presented in the book.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>Now, you can run </span><kbd>vagrant status</kbd><span>.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre> annotations:<br/>     description: "Node exporter {{ .Labels.instance }} is down."<br/>     link: "https://example.com"</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre> annotations:<br/>     description: "Node exporter {{ .Labels.instance }} is down."<br/>     link: "<strong>https://example.com</strong>"</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>vagrant up</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "You can find this page by going into <span class="packt_screen">Status | Rules</span> on the top bar.</span><span>"</span></p>
