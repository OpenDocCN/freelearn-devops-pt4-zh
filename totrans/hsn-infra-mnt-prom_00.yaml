- en: This book about Prometheus, the second project to graduate within the **Cloud
    Native Computing Foundation** (**CNCF**), will help you to crystallize the core
    fundamentals of monitoring and the approaches available to ensure the required
    infrastructure visibility. It relies on practical examples, using test environments
    and diagrams, to communicate knowledge in an easy-to-digest manner.

    are tackled. Our main goal during the writing process was to aim the book at our
    past selves and ensure that they would have everything they needed to know about
    this technology in this book.

    creating and testing alerting rules, to templating slack notifications; and from
    useful dashboards, to automating target discovery; many other topics will be explained
    to ensure a full knowledge base on infrastructure monitoring using Prometheus
    as its cornerstone.
