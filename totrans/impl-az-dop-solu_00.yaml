- en: As the speed at which IT products are being created and delivered is ever more
    important when it comes to companies succeeding, the demand for IT professionals
    with a thorough understanding of DevOps is increasing year on year. In this book, *Implementing
    Azure DevOps Solutions,* you will learn about the Microsoft tools that help to
    make this possible. Besides this, the knowledge that you acquire will help you
    to embrace DevOps and improve the way you continuously deliver value to your end
    users.

- en: This book targets software developers and operations' specialists interested
    in implementing DevOps practices on the Azure cloud. Application developers and
    IT professionals with some experience in software development and development
    practices will also find this book useful. Some familiarity with basic usage of
    Azure DevOps would be an added bonus.

- en: The book comprises four parts. The chapters are in the recommended reading order
    and each chapter builds upon the previous one. The order of the chapters is such
    that it matches the order in which you would implement the different aspects in
    the real world. However, it is possible to pick and choose, especially once you
    have gone through the first part in its entirety.

    provides you with an understanding of what DevOps is and what it is not. DevOps
    is defined and its relationship to the Agile way of working is described. The
    chapter ends with an introduction to DevOps practices and habits that are central
    to a DevOps culture.'

    with Source Control*, introduces different types of source control systems and
    how they compare. Pull requests and code reviews are introduced as the default
    way for ensuring that every change is reviewed before it becomes part of the source.
    The chapter concludes by going over a number of strategies for branching and merging
    that align well with a way of working that focuses on a constant flow of value.'

    Integration,* covers how to go from sources to build artifacts that are ready
    to be deployed later on. Azure Pipelines, as the most important way of doing so,
    is covered in depth. Alongside the classical, visual editor, YAML pipelines-as-code
    are also introduced.'

    about orchestrating deployments using Azure Pipelines. Once again, the classical,
    visual release editor is introduced. Multi-stage YAML pipelines are also introduced
    as a means of also describing your deployment process as code. The chapter concludes
    by introducing different deployment strategies that can be used to mitigate the
    risks that come with continuous deployment, to balance the need for change with
    stability.'

    introduces package management. Package management can be used as a means for splitting
    larger software solutions into multiple components that are built and tested independently and
    only then put together. Packages can also be used to distribute build artifacts
    between different continuous integration and deployment products.'

    Configuration as Code,* goes into how creating, managing and configuring infrastructure
    can be transformed from a manual, error-prone task into the automated deployment
    of configuration that is kept as code in source control. The chapter covers ARM
    templates, Azure Blueprints, Azure App Configuration services, and a number of
    related tools.'

    value if the quality of new versions is not high enough. This chapter introduces
    different types of tests and how they can be integrated within Azure DevOps Pipelines.'

    You will learn how security and dependency scanning can be integrated into pipelines.
    Azure Policy and Security Center are introduced for preventing non-compliant configurations
    and detecting new risks that come in over time.'

    You will learn how you can interact with users to drive your roadmap and maximize
    the value delivered to users. Hypothesis-driven development is introduced as an
    approach to minimize investments that do have minimal returns and find features
    that are in high demand and bring great value.'
