    it needs to, you also need to ensure it doesn't do things that it shouldn't. In
    the previous chapter, you learned about quality and testing in order to continuously
    measure whether your application is doing what it is supposed to do. In this chapter,
    you will learn how to prevent any unwanted behavior. This is the subject of security
    and compliance. While increasing the flow of value to your end users—by deploying
    faster and shortening delivery cycles—you will still want to make sure that you
    are delivering secure and compliant software. In this chapter, you will learn
    how to address these concerns in your DevOps processes.

    to accept a full DevOps mindset, in order to ship software often and quickly.
    In the past, they used to have fewer releases that were all handed off for a security
    or pen test before being deployed to production. This gave them the confidence
    that they were not shipping software that contained security vulnerabilities.

    the final release conflicts with a DevOps mindset, and this is where some companies
    struggle. They are looking for ways to ensure that they are shipping business
    value to their users but are not willing to compromise on security to do so. The
    question is whether this is a fair trade-off. Wouldn't it be possible to have
    both speed and security? Might it not actually be the case that releasing faster
    and more often, in combination with rigorous automation, can help to increase
    the level of security in software development? To answer this question, it is
    good to first explore how security is often practiced in non-DevOps environments
    and how this needs to be changed when adopting DevOps.

    the tests by developing only for known test cases. Both experience and research
    show that the opposite is true. Putting developers and testers together results
    in products of higher quality. It is for this reason that movements such as Agile

    security. They advocate that pen tests or vulnerability reviews of applications

    are two approaches for doing this.
  id: totrans-97

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在DevOps文化转型之前，通常定期进行的安全评估不能完全被忽视。这意味着，不能把它们省略，而是必须以其他方式进行。对此有两种方法。
- en: The first approach is to keep doing pen tests, security reviews, and other security
    inspections at regular intervals just as before. However, instead of waiting for
    an OK from the tests before moving to production, the code is deployed to production
    separate from the security assessment(s). This implies that there is an accepted
    risk that there might be vulnerabilities shipped to production that are found
    only during the next security scan and will be addressed in the next release.
    Using this approach, it is possible to achieve speed, but then it also needs to
    be accepted that some vulnerabilities might exist for a while.
  id: totrans-98
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 第一种方法是继续定期进行渗透测试、安全评审和其他安全检查，就像以前一样。然而，代码不是等到通过测试后才进入生产环境，而是与安全评估分开直接部署到生产环境。这意味着存在一个接受的风险，即可能会有漏洞被部署到生产环境，直到下一次安全扫描时才会发现，并将在下一个版本中解决。采用这种方法，可以提高速度，但也需要接受一些漏洞可能会存在一段时间。
- en: The second approach relies on making application security scanning part of the
    regular workflow for committing code to the source code repository. For example,
    security code reviews do not have to be done per increment or every two months.
    They can also be done per pull request—before the code gets merged. Now, all of
    a sudden, you are no longer detecting vulnerabilities but are instead preventing
    them. The same can be done with security vulnerability scans. They can become
    part of the delivery pipeline, or a full nightly QA build that reports back on
    the quality of development every morning.
  id: totrans-99
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 第二种方法是将应用程序安全扫描纳入提交代码到源代码仓库的常规工作流程中。例如，安全代码评审不需要每次增量更新时都做，也不需要每两个月做一次。它们也可以在每次拉取请求时进行——在代码合并之前。这样一来，你就不再是检测漏洞，而是在防止漏洞的产生。安全漏洞扫描也可以采用同样的方式，它们可以成为交付流水线的一部分，或者成为一个完整的夜间QA构建，每天早上报告开发质量。
- en: Of course, it is often not as black and white, and many companies use a combination
    of these approaches. They use automated feedback mechanisms to detect whatever
    they can, make security code reviews part of the pull request workflow, and then
    combine this with manual pen testing at regular intervals. In this way, the speed
    of delivery is increased, while there is no increase or even a decrease in security
    risks, the last being the consequence of the speed at which vulnerabilities can
    be mitigated.
  id: totrans-100

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 当然，这种方式往往不是非黑即白，许多公司会采用这些方法的组合。他们使用自动化反馈机制来检测能发现的漏洞，将安全代码评审纳入拉取请求工作流，然后结合定期的人工渗透测试。通过这种方式，交付速度得以提高，同时安全风险并没有增加，甚至因为能够快速缓解漏洞而有所减少。

    complete, deployed software solution, including all its support infrastructure
    is made out of so much more than just the code. On top of that, there are many
    interactions with a solution that may be unexpected or unplanned. Monitoring all
    of this continuously in production is necessary, not just to prevent security
    concerns but to also detect any security concerns coming up. In Azure, one of
    the tools available for doing just that is Azure Security Center. Azure Security
    Center is offered via the Azure portal and can be selected as any other service
