    DevOps. In this chapter, we will take a step back and look at how you can build
    a strong DevOps organization and what you need to think about when doing so. Next,
    you will learn what this can bring you with regard to security and traceability.
    From there on, you will learn how you can consolidate your toolchain, standardizing
    on Azure DevOps.

    which constructs are available to lay out your products and teams in the tool.
    You will also learn about licensing and the security implications of the different
    approaches. Next, you will learn about traceability and how that can be used to
    create a verifiable software development process. Next up is the consolidation
    of the tools used. As you progress on your DevOps journey, you may find that each
    team uses different tools that it is familiar with and enjoys working with. While
    DevOps is all about empowering people, some level of standardization might be
    desirable, and you will learn how to go about this. Finally, you will read that
    you might have to accept that you will never be completely done adopting DevOps.

    the previous chapters, an Azure DevOps organization might have been created specifically
    for this use, or maybe one was available already that could be used for this purpose.
    However, creating an organization for a company from scratch takes a little more
    consideration. Taking the time to properly plan the layout of the organization
    can save a lot of time later on.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The top-level construct in Azure DevOps is called an organization. For most
    companies, a total of one organization will suffice, but it is allowed to create
    more than one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each Azure DevOps organization is hosted in a specific region. Most of the data
    (source code and work items) for the organization is guaranteed to be located
    in the region for the organization, but some information is always stored in other
    data centers due to the global reach of the service. Having a distributed organization
    with teams and products in different geographies can be one reason for using more
    than one organization. For example, if some teams are located in Australia and
    some in West Europe, it makes sense to create two separate organizations and host
    all teams in the geography closest to them. This will locate the bulk of the services
    that are physically close to them, greatly reducing latencies when working with
    Azure DevOps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An organization can be linked to an **Azure Active Directory** (**AAD**). If
    this link is enabled, only users that are inside that particular AAD are allowed
    access to the organization. Using a company AAD is not mandatory; an organization
    can also be created using a Microsoft account.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In each organization, one or more projects can be created. A project is an isolated
    container of work items, source control repositories, pipeline definitions, and
    all other Azure DevOps artifacts. There are only limited sharing and linking possibilities
    between projects. At the time of writing, only work items can be related across
    projects and nothing else can. This way, projects can serve as a strong isolation
    boundary for enforcing rigid security between products or teams if needed. In
    general, it is recommended to have as few projects as possible, with the goal
    of having only one if possible.

    projects as possible. But in this example, the latency from Australia to West
    Europe is a good argument to split into two organizations to have Azure DevOps
    hosted close to the teams. The split into two projects in West Europe might be
    due to the need for a high level of isolation for team 4 that is working on product
    3.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Combining the teams 1 to 3 and products 1 and 2 into one project has been done
    on purpose. The reason for this is that within a single project, multiple product
    areas and multiple teams can be defined. Having all of these in a single project
    enables easy linking of work items to do portfolio management. This way, working
    items from one team can also be related to the commits or pull requests of another
    team on another product. This is helpful if features are spread over multiple
    products or applications (components).

    security groups. The security group is either a logical wrapper around an existing

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Organization-and project-level authorizations**: To allow a user to perform
    a specific action on every object of a certain type, an organization- or project-level
    authorization can be set. As an example, look at the built-in groups, `Project
    Collection Build Administrators`, respectively, `[ProjectName]\Build Administrators`,
    which, by default, have permission to view, manage, and edit build definitions
    and build resources. The permissions that can be set on the organization and project
    level are automatically applied to all individual resources in the organization
    or the project.'

  prefs: []

- en: For each group, for each action, it is possible to configure Allow, Deny, Not
    set, or inherited. When an action is configured with Deny, access is never allowed,
    not even if a user is part of a group that has the authorization specified as
    Allow**.** In other words, when there are two conflicting assignments (Allow and
    Deny), Deny will take precedence over Allow. Not set is to be interpreted as an
    implicit deny that does not take precedence. In other words, when there are two
    conflicting assignments (Not set and Allow), the user will be allowed access.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some artifacts in Azure DevOps are part of a hierarchy. For example, pipelines
    can be in a folder. Whenever inheritance is enabled, permissions from higher in
    the hierarchy will propagate to the artifact. This means that, when a user has
    access to a pipeline folder, all of their rights will propagate to all underlying
    folders and pipelines, if and only if, there are no more specific authorizations
    set.

    some traceability. For example, when working with Jira and GitHub, it is possible

    is that it is not about blame. Traceability is not about finding out who made
    which mistake, but about finding out what the state of things is and how objects
    relate. As soon as traceability becomes the basis for blame, engineers will soon
    find ways to hide their work. This will result in more errors and less visibility,

    Teams operate in different ecosystems, leading to different tool choices. Or maybe
    teams just have different preferences or started adopting DevOps practices at

- en: The second possible strategy is a big-bang migration. At some point, the old
    tool is switched off, all data is migrated to the new tool, and the new tool is
    made available. If there is anything that does not breathe DevOps, it is such
    a migration. It has a high potential for issues and often there is no turning
    back. Often, this is not a good migration strategy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, one situation where such an approach might make sense is the migration
    of source control. There are tools available for migrating from different sources
    to any type of hosted Git solution, including Azure DevOps. Source control also
    has the benefit that change history is built so deep into the system that migrating
    with history is often easier than for other types of data.

- en: Another strategy for migration is allowing for a period of time where both tools
    can be used at the same time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One way to do this is by using a tool that can be used to sync between the old
    and the new tool. This can be either in one direction, from old to new, or in
    both directions. This way, an in-between situation is created where both tools
    can be in use at the same time. Every team can choose its own time for its migration
    within a certain window. This avoids a forced migration window. Teams can also
    opt to use both tools next to each other for a while. This allows them to learn
    the new tool, while still being able to switch to the tool that they know if they
    are under pressure. After a period of transition, the old tool can be made read-only
    or decommissioned completely. This approach often works well for work tracking
    systems. Between these systems, the concepts are often very similar (epics, features,
    stories, and sprints), which makes a synchronization a feasible approach.

- en: A slightly different approach is that of asking teams to rebuild in the new
    tool. This approach also creates an in-parallel situation, but there is no automated
    migration or synchronization. Teams will have to redo their process or way of
    working in the new tool. Since this can take a while, the old tool will remain
    while teams are working on this. One situation where this is often a good approach
    is that of build and/or release pipelines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: No matter the strategy that has been chosen, in all cases, it helps to make
    sure that the new tool or tools are an improvement for the teams over the existing
    tools. This should improve performance, traceability, ease of use, or integration
    with other company tools. A positive vibe around any migration can improve the
    outcomes dramatically.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As an alternative to replacing no longer preferred tools, it is also possible
    to integrate them with the preferred tool. Especially when it has been decided
    to move to Azure DevOps, this can be a powerful strategy. In many of the chapters
    before, for each topic, different tools were listed that integrate with Azure
    DevOps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When pursuing end-to-end traceability, these integrations can be used as a means
    to bring tools closer together. Consider the following example.

    repositories, and executing build pipelines. Deployments are done using Octopus
    Deploy for historic reasons. Since a full migration is too costly, as an alternative,
    an integration strategy is chosen. Triggering the Octopus Deploy not manually
    but automatically from Azure DevOps meets several goals:'

- en: It is fair to expect that, at any point in time, there will be one or more improvements
    that teams want to make to their applications, toolchain, or way of working. To
    cope with this, it is recommended to not keep changing everything all of the time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead, try to implement changes in batches or a series of well-defined steps.
    Also, note there is a natural order in things. It is impossible to practice continuous
    deployment without having a proper continuous integration process first. Also,
    adopting infrastructure as code will deliver the most value when a continuous
    deployment process for application code is already in place. Next, automating
    governance and security measures works best when infrastructure and configuration
    code is common practice. And once all of these practices have been implemented,
    new things will come up on the radar—future improvements that may be necessary.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Besides this series of improvements, it is also important to realize that not
    every team is at the same place in this journey and not every team can move at
    the same pace and that development is not always this linear.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But this does not mean that it is impossible to track and plan future changes
    and have learnings from one team applied to other teams as well. One oversimplified
    approach to tracking this can be a table, as shown here.

    of them are practicing **continuous** **deployment** (**CD**), while team 3 is
    still working on that (**Work in Progress**, **WIP**) and the fifth team has not
    started yet. Finally, team 2 is already experimenting with **infrastructure as
    code** (**IaC**). Finally, as there is no end state, it is only a matter of time
    before the next practice or idea will pop up and a team will start experimenting:'

- en: If a table, similar to the one shown in the preceding, is updated, evaluated,
    and expanded upon frequently, this helps to foster continuous learning and improve
    the way software is created and delivered. Learning and improving will become
    the standard and this will help to improve the delivery of value to end users.
    It also shows that adopting DevOps is never done.

- en: It also provides the means to see which teams are at the forefront and which
    teams are following along. By giving teams who are in the lead more room for experimentation
    and knowledge sharing with other teams, organizations can encourage their leader
    teams to improve even more while, at the same time, accelerating other teams as
    well.

- en: In this chapter, you learned how to configure your Azure DevOps organization
    and how to create a layout for your products and teams. You learned what the implications
    are regarding the different configuration options and how to apply those. Next,
    you learned how you can use Azure DevOps to add traceability to your development
    process. You learned how to capture ideas and tasks in stories and tasks and how
    these can be traced all of the way to a deployment and the other way around. The
    next thing you learned about is how to approach the consolidation of tools used
    within your organization and when to stop trying to consolidate tools. Finally,
    you learned that it is important to continuously keep improving.
  prefs: []

- en: With the things you learned in this chapter, you are now capable of setting
    up and configuring Azure DevOps for your team, teams, or organization. You can
    create a structure that fits your organization and start using it with just one
    or multiple teams. You are also able to slowly standardize your way of working
    and consolidate the teams on the same set of tools.

    a basis for taking the AZ-400 exam, as most of the topics are along similar lines.
    However, in order to be well prepared for the exam, I recommend reading more about
    them in other sources as well and try to get as much hands-on experience as you
    can. As a practice tool, the concluding chapter contains a mock exam to help you
    prepare for the final exam.
