<li>You create a new feed and allow any user in your Azure Active Directory to use packages from this feed. You move the package to be shared to this feed.</li>
<li>You allow all users within your organization to use your existing feed.</li>
<li>You create a new feed and allow any user in your organization to use packages from this feed. You move the package to be shared to this view.</li>
<li>You create a new view in your existing feed and publish the package to be shared to this view. Next, you configure that all members of your organization can read packages from this view.</li>
<li>You add your existing feed as an upstream source to the feed that is used by any other team so they can pull your packages as well.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Which of the following are valid arguments for splitting your solution into multiple smaller solutions and using shared packages or libraries for assembling the complete application from these smaller solutions? [Choose two.]
<ol>
<li>You have over 25 C# projects in a single solution.</li>
<li>Your code base is becoming so large that compilation and/or running unit tests is starting to take too long.</li>
<li>Your team is becoming too big and is split into two. Splitting the solution as well will establish clear ownership: one solution per team.</li>

<li>External views</li>
<li>Upstream views</li>

<ol>
<li>Link the shared library as a shared project into the two consuming solutions.</li>
<li>Have the library in a separate repository and use a build pipeline for building the library and upload it as a NuGet package to Azure Artifacts. Consume it from here in your two applications.</li>
</ol>

<li>You are working on an application that will be deployed in two different Azure Regions to allow for failover scenarios. Which of the following together make a valid solution? [Choose two.]
<ol>
<li>You create one ARM template with two parameter files. The first parameter file corresponds to the first Azure region, and the second parameter file to the second Azure region. You use the ARM templates to update the infrastructure.</li>
<li>You create an ARM template and parameter file to update the infrastructure in one region only. In the other region, you update the infrastructure manually to prevent configuration drift.</li>
<li>You first update the infrastructure in both regions. Only when the infrastructure is updated successfully do you deploy the application to both regions.</li>
