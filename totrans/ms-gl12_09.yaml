- en: The shortcomings of CVS have led to the development of other systems, with one
    of the most well-known being **Apache Subversion** (**SVN**). In addition to the
    improvements it has brought, it was specially ensured that is has high compatibility
    with CVS. It is also open source licensed (with an Apache license, not GNU). It
    was started in 2000 by Collabnet Inc., but changed to an Apache project in 2009\.

    You can even define finer-grained access rules based on paths. All of this is
    configured in a central location. With Git running on your client, there is no
    access control by default. Your server implementation or central repository that's
    running Git must do that for you. GitLab has this functionality.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both Git and SVN support the use of branches. However, for SVN, branches are
    part of a possible workflow and style, while for Git the use of branches is built
    into the command palette and standard way of working.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the major disadvantages of SVN is the way of branching and merging. It
    can take a long time if you have large repositories. If you create a new branch
    in SVN, you create a completely new directory within the repository, which means
    there is repetition in that structure. When the branch is ready or no longer needed,
    you commit back to the trunk.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A big technical difference between Git and SVN versions before 1.5 is that Git
    used three-way merges as standard, while SVN used two-way merges. It couldn't
    perform three-way merges because it didn't store merge information. Git, by using
    its graph database, can check where the code bases share a common state and then
    merge from the diversion point, which is then technically a three-way merge. In
    the latest version of SVN, this is also incorporated because the meta information
    about branches and merges is kept after merging. Unfortunately, the basic problem
    still exists – a branch is a full copy (not a reference).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the same time, there can be changes on the trunk already. Your version of
    it won't have the changes that are in the branches of developers. This means that
    you could have conflicting changes, files, or structures that are missing in your
    branch.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main reason developers like Git so much is the power of the branching model.
    Comparing it to the many repetitions in SVN, Git only creates references to a
    specific commit, so there's less repetition and less waste of space and I/O. Instantiating
    the reference by creation, deletion, or changing a branch will not affect the
    commits. Want to try something? Fix a bug quickly? Just create a branch, edit
    files, and push the commits to the central repository, then delete the branch.
    Create them lightheartedly!

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Speed is often recited as the main advantage Git has over SVN. This is not exactly
    the case when handling binary files. If developers checkout full repositories
    every time and they contain changing binary files, you lose this speed advantage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In SVN, only the working tree and the latest changes are checked out to the
    local system. When many changes are made to binary files, checking them out in
    SVN takes less time than with Git.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, there are workarounds for storing binary files in Git repositories,
    the most famous being Git LFS ([https://git-lfs.github.com/](https://git-lfs.github.com/)).
    This is a solution that was developed by GitHub and is an extension to Git. With
    it, you store a pointer inside your repository instead of in a big binary file.
    Still, every developer action leads to a pile of changed history data. This is
    going to make operations perform slower.

    configured GitLab, the location of LFS uploaded data can be on the GitLab server
    itself, or on shared server storage that's connected to you GitLab server. Alternatively,
    it can be stored on an S3-compatible service.

    remote SVN repository you specify, then download SVN revisions and convert them
    into Git commits. SubGit keeps both repositories synchronized. When a user pushes
    a new commit to Git, SubGit converts and tries to update SVN. It also gets new
    revisions from SVN as soon as they appear. SVN and Git users see each other's
    commits as if they were all working on the same versioning system. SubGit makes

    you will want to do it in one go. It decreases the margin of error and is easier

    issue, while some users don't care at all. If you want to map users, make sure
