<p>In this chapter, we will try to compare the theory from the previous chapter with its implementation in GitLab. As GitLab was born from a need to have a collaboration platform with advanced features, it has grown organically to its current form. It was built with agility in mind. We will present a use case where a small company wants to build a software product, and we will use GitLab to evolve the idea into a product.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will be covering following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GitLab workflow</li>
<li><span>Managing your ideas</span></li>
<li>Planning your feature</li>
<li>Creating it</li>
<li>Verifying your product</li>
<li>Packaging it for use</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember we introduced the DevOps pipeline as seen by GitLab in previous chapter. This screenshot shows the various GitLab stages:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/62d61cf6-be4e-4b8f-8303-74dd7066ce23.png"/></p>
<p>In this chapter, we will present several aspects of the entire pipeline as we try to use it in our example project. The first phase is defined as <strong>Manage</strong>, and it sounds a bit weird as the first part, but it is a continuous process spanning the entire pipeline, and GitLab provides tools for it. The next stage will be <strong>Plan</strong>, in which you refine and prioritize and set timelines. Then you start the <strong>Create</strong> phase where the tasks are executed to produce solutions. After creating your product, you need to test different aspects of it in the <strong>Verify</strong> phase. After verifying the product you will package it for deployment.</p>
<p>To explain the GitLab workflow in more detail, we will present a use case that is going to be used throughout this chapter to demonstrate features in GitLab. For some features you will need the most comprehensive GitLab license.</p>
<p>Imagine a company called <em>Event Horizon</em>. They want to build a solution for managing events (for humans). For instance, you can use their solution to arrange invitations to a party.</p>
<p>We introduce User1, who is a backend engineer, and is tasked with creating a backend for this solution. Then we also have User2, who is currently product owner of this product. They are both part of the IT department of the company. Then we have User3, who is part of the marketing department.</p>
<p>User1 and User2 have both been made members of the IT group in GitLab. User3 is a member of the marketing group, but<span> has reporter access to IT.</span></p>
<p>Let's help them create this product (minimally) and demonstrate how they can use GitLab for this.</p>
<p>In the meeting where both users and developers are present (the Release planning in XP, or Sprint 0 when using Scrum) it is decided that these are following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>We want to build an app to help organize events.</li>
<li>It needs to use email to communicate.</li>
<li>We are creating a list of invitees in advance.</li>
<li>Invitees can interactively indicate if they will attend.</li>
<li>Non-functional requirement: documentation is very important.</li>
<li>Non-functional requirement: we want to automate as much as possible.</li>
<li>Non-functional requirement: the tool used should enhance collaboration.</li>
<li>Non-functional requirement: the code used should be reviewed by at least one other person.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of the meeting, the requirements are prioritized and the developers talk without the customers about the possibilities with GitLab as a product. This phase is the subject of the next section.</p>

<p>Instead of creating big designs up front we have learned that iterative development is the way to go. But even for projects using Agile methodologies there are some considerations before your coding goes off to start. This stage in the DevOps life cycle is called <em>Manage</em> and it comprises the <em>whole life cycle</em>. It is the beginning of an Agile iteration but also the end and in between. You will manage your solution from the beginning and it never stops. An import part of managing is knowing how you are doing. You can analyze this in GitLab, as shown in the next section.</p>

<p>One of the most important metrics in developing software through an Agile method is the cycle time. This <strong>Key Performance Indicator</strong><span> (</span><strong>KPI</strong><span>)</span> is best described as the total time that has elapsed from the time work has started until completion of the task. Or in IT, the time it takes to get an idea implemented on production. </p>
<p>Before Agile project management, tools such as Microsoft Project were used to keep track of time. Nowadays, <em>guesstimates</em> are not entered in a project anymore, but other things such as risk and velocity are calculated in story points and they are used to plan some weeks ahead.</p>
<p>In GitLab, there is a place to measure cycle times: cycle analytics. It means you have to use GitLab's project management features and it is available in all editions. The following image is an example of cycle analytics for the GitLab CE project. Notice that it takes about a month for an idea to go into production (which corresponds nicely with its actual release cycle):</p>

<p>We can use cycle analytics later in the project to check how well GitLab is used and what velocity the development team has.</p>

<p>The next stage in the DevOps life cycle that GitLab is envisioning is <em>Plan</em>. For this phase, we will explore all the steps needed to prepare for the coding and building of the solution. In GitLab, there are several tools that can help you in this phase, regardless of which development methodology you prefer (Agile or waterfall). Where to begin? We always begin with creating an issue. We will discuss this in the next section:</p>

<p>What is an issue? Well, it can be many things. It could be a new business idea, a technical problem, a cry for help. An issue is like starting a new discussion, and it is a way to express your thinking. It should change along the way as other people get involved. It is the atomic, basic, first thing in GitLab that everything else is derived from. It always a good idea to start looking in the existing list of issues to see if your problem or wish is already part of an existing issue.</p>
<p>GitLab, as a product, facilitates this discussion and offers ways to manage it and flows to verify assumptions.</p>
<p><span>An issue has several attributes and concepts, which we will look at.</span></p>

<p>Of course, an issue has content, so how is it structured? The issue  has a title and a description. It is also possible to insert tasks into the issue using markdown formatting. What also counts as content are the accompanying comments and events/activities that are linked and viewable through the issue. Within the content you can also insert quick actions, which will be discussed later in this chapter.</p>

<p>There are several states an issue can be in. Of course, it can be open or closed. Another aspect of state is the confidentiality of the issue. If there is sensitive information, an issue can be marked as confidential. The visibility of the issue is then limited to members of the group who have  at least reporter permissions. </p>

<p>Every issue has an author, and that information is prominently displayed, along with the current assignee. Other meta information consists of well-known project management data, such as: milestones, due dates, and weight.</p>
<p>Let's try to make this clear, based on our example. The <em>Event Horizon</em> company is about to start the first Scrum sprints. They want to use GitLab issues for project management.</p>
<p>User1 creates an issue in which he asks which technology we are going to use. That could be an example of the first issue, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/15f4e0ec-3a38-423e-8379-ae9d54e02410.png" style="width:43.75em;height:24.92em;"/></p>
<div>
<p>You will see that there is a list with tasks defined.</p>
<p>User2 creates an issue regarding which documentation style to use for the project, <span>as shown in the following screenshot:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/12648d2e-0b24-487a-906f-c1816311b7b3.png" style="width:43.25em;height:26.58em;"/></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Both are valid questions to ask, and to start a discussion about, and we will see how this continues when an issue evolves to the next level, a discussion. We will talk about this in the next section.</p>

<p>This a very important part of GitLab and is the next step in issue discovery. It is possible to give feedback in the form of comments in the context of an issue, and also in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Epics</li>
<li>Merge requests</li>
<li>Snippets</li>
<li>Commits</li>
<li>Commit diffs</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also possible to create a threaded discussion or to transform a comment into one. You can use markdown to format your text and use quick actions (as described in the <em>Quick actions</em> section in this chapter). The default comment form is shown in the following example: </p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/43e61ef1-6397-4408-aded-2d241c6adcd7.png" style="width:35.58em;height:15.83em;"/></p>
<p>If you have set up your GitLab for incoming email, you can respond to emails that are sent as comment notification emails. Replying to those will create a new comment or discussion item. In the following screenshot, you will find a discussion for an issue in the Event Horizon web application:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/6d188eba-fdd0-4991-9a1b-02e575f65c46.png" style="width:31.58em;height:24.08em;"/></p>
<p>As mentioned, it is also possible to add a discussion to an epic, which we will discuss later. The following example is the screenshot for adding any discussion to an epic:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/938bbca0-e766-4528-8adf-a1ff56c9b128.png" style="width:55.33em;height:48.00em;"/></p>
<p>Using these discussions, the idea evolves, as does the understanding of it.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Milestones</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Milestones can have different functions in a project, but are used in GitLab to indicate where one stands in achieving a common goal for which issues and merge requests are defined.</p>
<p>A milestone can be used to mark the beginning and the end of an Agile iteration or a sprint. It's quite practical to just name the milestone after your sprint and then you can associate issues to the milestone to add work.</p>
<p>At GitLab, they are used as one release cycle. For instance, when they go from release 11.8 to 11.9, all the work contained in that release will be represented by a milestone, and that will be labeled 11.9. Each piece of work is represented in an issue, for instance, the problems you need to solve, the conversation. All these issues work together towards one large milestone.</p>
<p>For the Event Horizon project, there are three milestones defined: <span class="packt_screen">mvp 1</span>, <span class="packt_screen">MVP3</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">mvp2</span>. You can see them as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3f2914fb-85fe-49a5-ad44-cfde50b2bfd6.png" style="width:75.92em;height:34.83em;"/></p>
<p>If we open a milestone, it has the following characteristics:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/808ba8ad-b21a-4432-9912-caf63a359f3e.png"/></p>
<div>
<div>
<p><span>Project milestones can only be linked to issues and merge requests in the project context. You can view a list of milestones by going to <span class="packt_screen">Issues</span> and then <span class="packt_screen">Milestones</span>. Group milestones can be linked with issues and merge requests on the group context, which means you can link it to several projects that are part of the group. The list of those can be found via the <span class="packt_screen">Issues</span> and then <span class="packt_screen">Milestones</span> links in the group. A general view of all milestones is via the dashboard milestones list, or via the top navigation link, <span class="packt_screen">Milestones</span>.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<div>
<p>If you have GitLab EE, you can create epics. An epic is an extensive user story that still has to be broken down into a set of smaller user stories. Usually, an epic describes a defined piece of functionality or product property, but needs to be worked out in more detail before the team can commit to this feature to be realized within one sprint. It's like a theme among issues.</p>
<p>For big organizations that work with long-running project management programs, there is also the option to have multi-level epics so that you can link and coordinate efforts. There is a button (<span class="packt_screen">+</span>) for it in the creation form of the epic.</p>
<p>Epics very much resemble issues in that you have the same editing functions and state. The same formatting is applicable, and also the same quick actions. Maybe more importantly for epics is the option to set due dates. Big projects that cover multiple business domains are still more date driven, so we can imagine that these fields are more appropriate here then in Agile-drive smaller projects.</p>
<p>From the epic, you can navigate to the linked issues. Also, when issues become too big and are <span>misrepresented </span>epics, it is also possible to promote an issue to an epic.</p>
<p>For the Event Horizon  project, the <span>Product Owner</span> User3 can create an epic to track the progress of the two different projects and the issues that were created earlier. The following screenshot shows the tracking progress for the projects:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/c80fbee3-6d07-4eb4-b5a5-f32eadfec323.png" style="width:35.58em;height:43.25em;"/></p>
<p>The ability to use epics to group issues is necessary for keeping control over multiple discussions and issues and projects that together work towards a solution.</p>

<p><span>With this feature, you can track how much time is being spent on issues and merge requests. You can also track what was estimated, to see where you stand. It is part of GitLab Core.</span></p>
<div>
<p>In the following screenshot, we can see that for an issue in the eventmanager project some time has been estimated and spent:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/89c5d5d7-8119-4cbb-b541-7161e9571d50.png"/></p>
<p>In the body of an issue or merge request, and in comments, you can use quick actions to enter the estimated and spent time for the issue. It can only be done by team members.</p>
<p>As seen in the following screenshot, you can use <kbd>/estimate</kbd>, followed by the unit of time. If something will take five days and four hours, you would write <kbd>/estimate 5d 4h</kbd> in a comment and, after that, press <span class="packt_screen">Comment</span>. There can only be one estimate. You can also remove it by using <kbd>/remove_estimate</kbd>. Here's the screenshot for reference:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3c985bf3-f1b3-4dbe-80cb-bcc5c9004668.png" style="width:32.25em;height:18.00em;"/></p>
<p>In the same manner, you can record how much time has been spent on the issue. Members of the project can use a quick <kbd>/spent</kbd> action in issues and merge requests to add time to a total amount of time that is dedicated to an issue. For example, if two hours have been spent, you issue <kbd>/spent 2h</kbd>, and it will show in the right panel. You can even remove time spent by using negative numbers, for instance, <kbd>/spend -1h</kbd>. It won't go below 0, but will reset the number. You can remove the total at once with <kbd>/remote_time_spent</kbd>.</p>

<p>A very handy feature in GitLab is the quick action. You can use a <kbd>/</kbd> with certain keywords to trigger a command on issues, epics, merge requests, and commits, just like you can with something like IRC chat. It is faster than using GitLab's web buttons or other controls. Remember to put each <em>command</em> on a separate line, otherwise it will be parsed incorrectly. Once they are parsed and executed, they will be removed from the text and nobody can see them. There is, of course, an audit trail for the action executed<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Some samples of quick action are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>/todo</kbd>: Add a todo item from the comment</li>
<li><kbd>/done</kbd>: Mark the todo as done</li>
<li><kbd>/close</kbd>: Same as clicking the close button</li>
<li><kbd>/assign me</kbd> or <kbd>@someone else</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>/milestone %milestone</kbd>: Set a milestone from the comment</li>
<li><kbd>/estimate &lt;1w 3d 1h 10m&gt;</kbd>: Add a time estimation</li>
<li><kbd>/due &lt;in 1 day&gt;</kbd>: Set a due date</li>
<li><kbd>/approve</kbd>: Approve a merge request</li>
<li>Special quick action for commit messages: <kbd>/tag v1.5</kbd> – Tag immediately a commit with a message of choice</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox">

<p>Hidden in GitLab is a very nice project management feature. It is called the <em>Project Issue board</em>. It can be used to implement a workflow by using visualization and can help to plan and organize. It does not enforce one way of working. You have to organize and form your own process. The boards are heavily dependent on labels, which are used to group issues into lists.</p>
<p>If you go to the issues in the left navigation bar, you will find the option <span class="packt_screen">Boards</span>. By default, you get a board called <span class="packt_screen">Development</span> that offers basic lanes such as <span class="packt_screen">Open</span>, <span class="packt_screen">To Do</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Doing</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Closed</span>. You can drag issues from lane to lane, indicating a change in state. For instance, if an issue is done, you drag it to <span class="packt_screen">Closed</span>. What happens is that the issue will automatically get the label <span class="packt_screen">Closed</span>. The following screenshot is an example of the project issue board for the eventmanager project:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/6698305c-19b9-4ee4-b610-c10455e10b26.png" style="width:65.83em;height:31.25em;"/></p>
<p>If you use GitLab Enterprise Edition, you can even have multiple issue boards, which can mean several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A board can be shared by multiple teams: Group Issue boards.</li>
<li>Each team can have its own boards.</li>
<li>There are several views for projects, based on the scope of the board (milestone, label, assignee and weight).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following screenshot, you can see how to create a new issue board by clicking on the drop-down list saying <span class="packt_screen">Development</span>. The default board is as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/5f2a5103-5893-4323-b023-a104de6a96c4.png" style="width:32.08em;height:23.92em;"/></p>
<p>When you click on <span class="packt_screen">Create new board</span> you will be presented with a form to enter the name of the new board, and the scope of the board. As with a label, it is just an attribute of an issue that is used to group or aggregate. Let's choose to focus on milestones, and choose the milestone <span class="packt_screen">MVP3</span>, which is the minimum viable product coming out of sprint 3, which is shown as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/88732478-0e27-4780-8616-ace7f4e47004.png" style="width:22.92em;height:37.75em;"/></p>
<p>After creation, you will be presented with an issue board including the issues that are already assigned to a milestone. You can add issues (which then are coupled to the milestone) with the <span class="packt_screen">Add Issues,</span> which is shown in the following example:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f75284f7-21b1-4791-8a95-babcf83682e5.png" style="width:60.83em;height:31.00em;"/></p>
<p>Issue boards can function as information radiators for teams, it organizes issues in the way you want and can be the subject of conversation for a team meeting.</p>

<p>A planning feature that is useful for the individual user is <em><span><span>t</span></span>odo</em>. Notification emails can pile up in your inbox and get messy. An easy-to-use todo list, where you can view your tasks sorted chronologically, is more focused. You will find them at the top of your navigation bar, as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/c77e7e73-c76e-4251-a06d-092f2930c9f8.png" style="width:32.33em;height:2.58em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>When you have clicked the todo item, you will see a list of your todos with the option to sort in different fields, as shown in the following example:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b12f422a-90eb-4e86-8b1c-794789e65dfa.png" style="width:64.33em;height:18.58em;"/></p>
<p>The following items could trigger a todo item:</p>
<ul>
<li>An issue or merge request is assigned to you.</li>
<li>Being <kbd>@mentioned</kbd> in an issue, merge request, commit, or epic.</li>
<li>A failed job in one of your project CI/CD pipelines that has been marked <em>not allowed to fail</em>.</li>
<li>When in an automatic pipeline, a merge request has a conflict.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that the project has been planned by creating issues, milestones and so on, it is time to really start building. The next phase is <em>Create</em>, and GitLab provides several tools to help you with this. Before you start building, you should make sure your project and group structure is adequate for cooperation. </p>

<p>The <em>Event Horizon</em> company has created two groups in GitLab. One group is called <span class="packt_screen">it</span> and another <span class="packt_screen">Marketing,</span> as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/16a8f1ba-2ad6-4c35-a5fd-36399e17cb81.png" style="width:16.42em;height:12.75em;"/></p>
<p>We have created two separate projects in this context. The first one is called eventmanager, which will hold the source code for the technical solution. You can create this project by clicking on <span class="packt_screen">New Project</span> if this is your first project, or click on the <span class="packt_screen">+</span> icon in the top navigation bar. The form to create a new project appears as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/78893e6f-c89e-4b23-9e6f-511927698361.png" style="width:75.58em;height:43.33em;"/></p>
<p>The title of the project is <kbd>eventmanager</kbd>, and it will also appear in the URL. Take a good look at the first part of the URL. This is the namespace that defaults to your own, but we want this project to be in the <span class="packt_screen">it</span> group. When you do that, you will notice that visibility is automatically set to <span class="packt_screen">Private</span>. This is because the group <em><span class="packt_screen">it</span></em> has this as default.</p>
<p>Finally, we want this project to be accompanied by a README, so we need to choose to automatically create it. Don't worry about what the project will look like, we will iterate on it in the sprint.</p>
<p>Next, there is a second project called eventmanager-documentation, which will consist of the documentation. We will use GitLab pages as a technology to build our user documentation, and will choose <span class="packt_screen">Pages/Plain HTML</span> as a template. This is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/769af59f-3e7c-4393-ab1f-47055da684e1.png" style="width:55.42em;height:51.42em;"/></p>
<p>You have to enter the <span class="packt_screen">Project name</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Project slug</span> and determine the visibility, as per the following example:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/12daa600-92cf-4ef9-9831-a50e203f0002.png" style="width:74.25em;height:40.50em;"/></p>
<p>If you click on projects you will see a list of two projects, as shown in the following example:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/16e55002-fa0a-4280-9b2b-a7f79d5b6887.png" style="width:72.00em;height:24.92em;"/></p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Now we have our project and group structure ready, let's deal with other features that promote cooperation.</p>

<p>If you have worked with GitHub as a developer, you will have seen <em>gists</em> before. These are little pieces of code that are usable for more than one goal. Often they could exist in several code repositories, but they are available as gists to be reused. In GitLab this concept is known as <em>snippets</em>. They are also used as examples to be discussed about, and so on. The following example is a screenshot of a new snippet:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/63280b2c-6bb3-4fcb-b259-8b9faf27b99d.png" style="width:35.58em;height:29.42em;"/></p>
<p>You can create snippets on a personal and project level. They can be made public, and there is even an option to embed them in your own site, as shown in the following example:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/ac8e612a-2dd6-47e7-8a44-1cc70ed8be25.png" style="width:39.25em;height:3.25em;"/></p>
<p>Snippets can be used to share information, and using them could help to fulfill the requirement for the platform to enhance collaboration.</p>

<p>As of GitLab 10.4, an enhanced web editor is available in GitLab that gives you the ability to work on code online from the web. It offers many different features, including syntax highlighting for the most common languages (PHP, Ruby, Shell, Python, Java, C) and markup languages (XML, Markdown, and HTML). It is based on the Monaco editor which you can find here: <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/">https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/</a>.</p>
<p>The Event Horizon company can also develop their software in the Web IDE. It, of course, has support for Ruby, the language in which GitLab is mostly written.</p>
<p>In the following screenshot, you will see a file from the eventmanager project shown in the web IDE:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/bd912d94-4f5c-44be-a913-fc7fba03bd12.png"/></p>
<p>Use of this tool would also enhance collaboration within Event Horizon.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>While we have created a separate project to provide documentation for our new software product, GitLab also has a system for creating documentation by default. It is the Wiki feature. Every project can easily enable this feature and you will then have a full-blown wiki system available.</p>
<p>When you navigate to the <span class="packt_screen">Wiki</span> through the left navigation bar in your project you will be presented with the following screen:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/dc78b5a8-14f0-4570-b4a0-87cdf7b6310f.png" style="width:21.00em;height:10.42em;"/></p>
<p>If you create a new wiki, you will have to provide a title, the markup language used, and then you can start adding content. As all the information is itself saved in an accompanying Git repository, you can give the <span class="packt_screen">Commit message</span>, because saving the page is creating a new commit, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/be27fe4a-7785-48ba-9242-2d4f5f94108a.png" style="width:53.67em;height:38.67em;"/></p>
<p>Once created, you will see the page if you click on <span class="packt_screen">Wiki</span> the next time. You can now create more pages (even a page hierarchy if you want) and you can view the page history (everything is versioned), as shown in the following example:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f1a91978-c93e-4073-92fa-71d87511502e.png" style="width:54.75em;height:32.83em;"/></p>
<p>As you can see, Wiki is another feature that enhances collaboration between employees.</p>

<p>Because in Git it is possible to rewrite the entire history, GitLab has some mechanisms built in to help mitigate this risk. You can use <em>protected branches</em>.</p>
<p>Protected branches have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before GitLab 11.9 you could not create a protected branch, only <em>Maintainers</em> could (as of 11.9 Developers can create them).</li>
<li>Only Maintainers can push directly to a protected branch.</li>
<li>It is prohibited to use force push to a protected branch.</li>
<li>A protected branch cannot be deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only way to accept changes into a protected branch is to use merge requests. By default, the master branch is a protected branch. The following example is the screenshot for the<span> protected branch:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/66b43538-9e8e-4168-b388-7f460319e0b8.png"/></p>
<p>Using a protected branch forces the use of code reviews, which is a requirement for the eventmanager project.</p>

<p>So, the first version of eventmanager is almost ready. User1 has uploaded the latest changes to branch MVP1, and is ready to create a merge request, as shown i<span>n the following screenshot</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/fbf0fb17-6e49-4f26-b06d-48aed53299de.png" style="width:50.42em;height:20.17em;"/></p>
<p>You can see the usage of quick actions by specifying <kbd>Closes #2, #3</kbd> in the <span class="packt_screen">Description</span> field.</p>
<p>If you scroll down, you will see there is a section to view in which changes are introduced to the master branch when you accept this merge request. It shows you how many changes (<span class="packt_screen">6</span>) are in our example, which files are changed, and what was changed. This is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/0e2520de-1d1b-46b9-8222-832d5e61d423.png" style="width:30.67em;height:17.83em;"/></p>
<p>You can see <span class="packt_screen">User3</span> has been added as merge request approver, so he or she has to review the changes, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b7cb0024-8448-4b14-a3b6-45a2f43c7789.png"/></p>
<p>At the bottom of the screen, you can see which branches will be merged by this merge request, and you can specify to delete the originating branch and/or squash the changes (which means all changes are placed under one commit). This is shown in the following example:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/dd450b1b-deef-4ecf-858f-a7b7cd18b994.png" style="width:32.25em;height:12.00em;"/></p>
<p>If User3 logs in, he will have a todo item for reviewing this merge request. As an example, let's pretend User3 did a review and placed some comments. Let's look at part of the <kbd>index.erb</kbd> file that is used in the eventmanager app to display a message saying that someone is invited to an event. You can find the file in the code examples (<a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-GitLab-12/tree/master/Chapter09/eventmanager">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-GitLab-12/tree/master/Chapter09/eventmanager</a>). Here's the snippet of code that is picked by the reviewer as troublesome:</p>
<pre>&lt;p&gt;You are invited to my event on December 15!&lt;/p&gt;     </pre>
<p>User3 thinks the text <kbd>You are invited to my event on December 15!</kbd> is too specific. Better to keep the text simple. He wants to suggest changing the text to <kbd>You are invited to my event!</kbd>. He can add a suggestion using a quick action in markdown format in the review comment, shown as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/773aa9c6-8a8b-40f4-842c-e979e4867a41.png" style="width:29.83em;height:16.75em;"/></p>
<p>After saving the comment, it looks like the following example:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/0075c5aa-a348-46d8-bb42-b3bf5e2b80cb.png" style="width:27.92em;height:12.42em;"/></p>
<p>User3 can finish his review now. User1 gets a notification that the merge request has been reviewed. As he logs in and navigates to the review comment in the merge request, he will discover the suggestion made by User3 with a button to apply the suggestion. The comment will automatically be marked as resolved, as shown in the following example:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2d930d16-30e2-4617-88fa-c4943a7ff468.png" style="width:46.67em;height:11.58em;"/></p>
<p>There is another comment by User3 about an entry in the <kbd>attendees.yml</kbd> file, shown in the following code:</p>
<pre>attendees:<br/>   1:<br/>     attending: ''<br/>     email: someone@joustie.nl<br/>     guid: 3e8cb800-51ec-4d5d-ac7a-ca37ebe06389<br/>     name: Someone<br/>   10:<br/>     attending: 'NO'<br/>     email: anotherone@joustie.nl<br/>     guid: 1070d08f-c5ea-4247-95b1-ee7a3ca4a342<br/>     name: Anotherone<br/>   11:<br/>     attending: 'NO'<br/>     email: organiser@joustie.nl<br/>     guid: c7d49f48-2f05-468d-9d2e-9609e8311f3c<br/>     name: Organiser</pre>
<p>There are no sample entries in <kbd>attendees.yml</kbd> with a <kbd>YES</kbd>, so Users3 suggests to change one entry, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/5edcaf02-bebb-4548-8e2b-629c3acfafd8.png" style="width:23.42em;height:16.58em;"/></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the customer who attends the demo at the end of the sprint was not informed about the possibility to have an entry with <kbd>No</kbd>. There are also no real tests defined, so User1 decides to push this comment as an issue for the next iteration of the product, as shown in the following example:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f838d90b-5466-4f1d-a392-6cabf6b0ce70.png" style="width:53.83em;height:36.50em;"/></p>
<p>When all discussion points are resolved, the merge request can be approved by User3, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/eb945dfa-49dc-4f8d-aa5f-6ac0aeadd115.png" style="width:56.67em;height:35.67em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root">The merge request feature is one of the most important reasons to use GitLab. You can merge code or text in a project and cooperate on it.</p>

<p>The next phase in the DevOps life cycle is <em>Verify</em>. After building your product in the create phase, you need to verify whether the product meets the requirements, is secure, and that the quality in general is OK. This can all be done from within GitLab, by using the <strong>continuous integration</strong> (<strong>CI</strong>) features. In the following sections, we will discuss a number of components of the CI pipeline.</p>

<p>A nice feature that verifies code quality is a quality scan with CI/CD in GitLab. It makes use of the open source and free Code Climate engines (<a href="https://codeclimate.com/">https://codeclimate.com/</a>). It is embedded in a special Docker container that you can run within your GitLab runner. The following code is an example of a <kbd>.gitlab-ci.yml</kbd> file that runs such a scan:</p>

<p>When the jobs runs, the following logging is produced:</p>
<pre>Running with gitlab-runner 11.7.0 (8bb608ff)<br/>   on test-runner 97YoGmXL<br/>...</pre>
<p>After downloading the Docker container, it will start scanning the code. When the scanning is complete a report is generated, as follows:</p>
<pre>Uploading artifacts...<br/> gl-code-quality-report.json: found 1 matching files <br/> Uploading artifacts to coordinator... ok            id=403 responseStatus=201 Created token=ngLDxFmF<br/> Job succeeded</pre>
<p>To view the report, download the artifact from the right, where there are links to it. The following example shows the screenshot of the <span class="packt_screen">Job artifacts</span> tab:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/883e46ea-37c0-49e2-ad72-68a0d22681ab.png" style="width:16.17em;height:8.33em;"/></p>
<p>If you open the report with an editor to properly format it, it will show warnings or high or critical findings. In the case of the eventmanager project, it found an unused variable, as follows:</p>
<pre>         "type": "Issue",<br/>         "check_name": "Rubocop/Lint/UnusedBlockArgument",<br/>         "description": "Unused block argument - `letter`. If it's necessary, use `_` or `_letter` as an argument name to indicate that it won't be used.",<br/>         "categories": [<br/>             "Style"<br/>         ],<br/>         "remediation_points": 50000,<br/>         "location": {<br/>             "path": "addUID.rb",<br/>...</pre>
<p>Please notice the <kbd>"remediation_points": 50000,</kbd> entry, which scores the finding. This is different depending on the category finding, and can be used to compare total scores of several scans, showing you the progress (or decline) of total quality.</p>
<p>There follows the block of code that was mentioned in the report:</p>
<pre>    yaml_hash['attendees'].each do |<em>letter</em>, hash|<br/>     p hash['name']<br/>     p hash['email']<br/>     p hash['attending']<br/>     p hash['guid'] = SecureRandom.uuid if p hash['guid'] == nil<br/>    end</pre>
<p>You can see that in the first line there is a <kbd>letter</kbd> variable that is unused in the loop. If we change <kbd>letter</kbd> to <kbd>_letter</kbd> the test should not report it as a warning anymore. Unused variables are reported as a warning, you can suppress the warning with an underscore.</p>
<p><span>After the next run of the CI pipeline, the code quality scan will show that nothing was found, the report will be empty.</span></p>
<p>You can use Code Quality reports as well in merge requests. It can run before merge and you can compare remediation points. If there are likely to be critical findings, the job would show as failed and in red. Now that we have verified that the application is of minimum quality, we also want to verify if the app or website is OK for users. We can build review versions on which to perform manual tests. This is our next section.</p>

<p>The ultimate verification of your software product is to run all tests available and even mimic production. In GitLab, this can be accomplished by using GitLab CI and GitLab runners. For this to work, we will show an example using the eventmanager documentation site. One of the requirements of the project is, of course, creating documentation. We also created a separate project for it called <strong>eventmanager-documentation</strong>. There are already web pages present, so let's automate the review process (also one of the requirements: more automation). We are going to use an Amazon S3 bucket, which has been enabled to act as a webserver (you can find information about how to configure them here: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/HowDoIWebsiteConfiguration.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/HowDoIWebsiteConfiguration.html</a>).</p>
<p>To upload files to a S3 bucket, you need to authenticate with AWS. We can add secret variables to the project that contain the credentials for AWS that are needed. You can find them under <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">CI/CD</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Environment variables</span>,<span class="packt_screen"> </span>as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/cd725037-c403-46e1-9f8d-ec61365741d6.png"/></p>
<p>When the <kbd>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</kbd> and <kbd>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</kbd> variables are present, you can execute aws-cli actions within GitLab CI/CD pipelines. The <kbd>.gitlab-ci.yml</kbd> file that is used to deploy review apps is shown as follows:</p>
<pre>   review apps:<br/>    variables:<br/>      S3_BUCKET_NAME: "joustie-1"<br/>    image: python:latest<br/>    environment: review<br/>    script:<br/>     - pip install awscli<br/>     - aws s3 cp public/*.html s3://$S3_BUCKET_NAME/</pre>
<p>The job is called review apps, as seen on the first line. Then, after that, a variable is declared, the S3 bucket name. Next is the Docker image name that is used, which in this case is an image with Python installed, so we can make use of the Python-based AWS CLI utility that is installed in the script section. The last line contains the AWS CLI command to copy a file to an S3 bucket, and it authenticates through the environment variables that we have set.</p>
<p>After saving this file, the job will run, and if all goes well the HTML files are uploaded to your bucket. If you follow the job log you will see the following.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>First, it gets the container:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code highlight js-syntax-highlight plaintext solarized-dark" style="padding-left: 60px"><strong><span class="line"> Pulling docker image python:latest ...</span></strong></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Then it clones the repository:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code highlight js-syntax-highlight plaintext solarized-dark" style="padding-left: 60px"><strong><span class="line">Checking out 5625d409 as master...</span></strong></pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">It installs the Amazon CLI tool:</p>
<pre class="code highlight js-syntax-highlight plaintext solarized-dark" style="padding-left: 60px"><strong><span class="line"> $ pip install awscli</span>
<span class="line"> Collecting awscli</span></strong></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Then it uploads the HTML files to the S3 bucket:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code highlight js-syntax-highlight plaintext solarized-dark" style="padding-left: 60px"><strong><span class="line"> $ aws s3 cp public/*.html s3://$S3_BUCKET_NAME/</span> <span class="line"> Completed 617 Bytes/617 Bytes (2.1 KiB/s) with 1 file(s) remaining</span></strong></pre>
<div>
<p>When the job succeeds, the review environment will be created in GitLab. You can click on the <span class="packt_screen">review</span> link, as shown in the following example:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b45f1a72-2652-40a5-b863-a0c8f53c837b.png" style="width:32.42em;height:16.25em;"/></p>
<p>The next page will show a list of deployments in the review environment, as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3e9e71e5-9e53-49c7-900e-642b50867e52.png" style="width:67.58em;height:15.83em;"/></p>
<p>You can add the URL to the environment manually via edit, as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2facc908-2686-4f3b-bb59-769e2f5d49fd.png" style="width:69.58em;height:31.42em;"/></p>
<p>After adding the URL to the environment, a button <span class="packt_screen">View deployment</span> is available, as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/295c2f85-6e0d-45ce-80bb-5e334070b4a2.png" style="width:55.50em;height:6.92em;"/></p>
<p><span>If you click <span class="packt_screen">View deployment</span>, you will be taken to the review app, as follows:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/878655ac-e1b1-4918-bda7-3371d0d2336d.png" style="width:69.33em;height:14.42em;"/></p>
<p>As of version 12.0 of GitLab, you will have a 'review button' next to 'view app' in the pipeline view. It will then run the review app with a little form in the corner where you can enter feedback. This input will be directly inserted into the issue.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/8f9d8974-3e6c-4f2e-948a-6aac995877a9.png" style="width:22.83em;height:11.50em;"/></p>
<p>So, to verify our project we have used Code Quality reports for the eventmanager code. We learned that, initially, there was a warning that a variable was not used. We recommended a fix and we ran the pipeline again, and the warning went.</p>
<p>We have demonstrated the use of a review app for the documentation project. Using this review app we could verify that our initial requirements were met.</p>
<p>Both methods of automation implemented in your pipeline will greatly enhance your Agility and DevOps capabilities. When you find errors, you can correct them and run the pipeline again.</p>

<p>GitLab use Docker containers in their products for several purposes. To store container images that were custom built for projects they also added Docker Container Registry functionality to GitLab. By using this, you avoid having to store images in a remote location that is maybe not safe enough. The container registry is the subject of the next section.</p>

                </header>

<p>If you have the container registry enabled in GitLab, you can store Docker images that are built in your CI/CD process. To enable this GitLab feature, you have to reconfigure your GitLab instance and enable the registry functionality<strong>.</strong> When enabled, there will be a registry menu item on the left for each project. If you click on it, you can view the contents of the registry and instructions on how to use it, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/c89375d3-ed66-4fe1-a27d-155bee19a4f7.png"/></p>
<p>To store images in it for later use you have to edit your CI/CD configuration file in the root of your project. Here's an example for the eventmanager project:</p>
<pre>   build:<br/>   image: docker:stable<br/>    services:<br/>      - docker:dind<br/>    variables:<br/>      DOCKER_HOST: tcp://docker:2375<br/>      DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay2<br/>    stage: build<br/>    script:<br/>      - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD $CI_REGISTRY<br/>      - docker build -t $CI_REGISTRY/it/eventmanager:latest .<br/>      - docker push $CI_REGISTRY/it/eventmanager:latest</pre>
<p>To summarize the file, it defines a build job. On the second line, the image to use is defined <span><span>as</span></span> <kbd>docker:stable</kbd>. Because this image will build a docker container itself, it uses the <kbd>docker:dind</kbd> service, which enables Docker in Docker functionality. Then, in the variables section, there are two Docker variables defined: the Docker host to connect to (which is the docker engine and it will build a container itself) and the Docker storage driver to use, which is overlay2. The stage defined is build. Then, in the scripts section, the actual script is given, which is really a basic Docker build, which is preceded by a login to the GitLab Docker registry and followed by a push to that location. You can see variables that start with <kbd>$CI_REGISTRY</kbd>. These are predefined variables available within GitLab to use and make use of one time tokens.</p>
<p>When you save this file in the Web IDE, or push it to GitLab, the new pipeline will run immediately. If it does not run, or says there is no runner available, check if your runner is running in privileged mode. It needs this to run <kbd>docker:dind</kbd>.</p>
<p>After the image is finished, it is pushed to the GitLab registry with the latest tag. If this is successful the job has succeeded and will be green, as shown in the following code:</p>
<pre><strong>$ docker push $CI_REGISTRY/it/eventmanager:latest</strong><br/><strong> The push refers to repository [registry.joustie.nl:5005/it/eventmanager]</strong><br/><strong> 4fef5b78d890: Preparing</strong><br/><strong> 2cf71380877f: Preparing</strong><br/><strong> ...</strong><br/><strong>latest: digest: sha256:346123861d2c745902e3e2aae3101c0fb3c17414467c74204119f17c2c0cfc9c size: 1786</strong><br/><strong> Job succeede</strong>d</pre>
<p>You can verify afterwards that the container is present in the registry by navigating to the registry page of your project, as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3c2bf385-be47-46b2-a1ef-f0292a65422e.png" style="width:38.67em;height:9.58em;"/></p>

<div>
<p>The registry is a secure way to store image artifacts from the CI/CD pipeline. In the DevOps pipeline, it is part of the Package phase.</p>

<p>This chapter has tried to explain the GitLab flow using an example. Going through the first phases of the model with the eventmanager example demonstrates why GitLab is a tool that has sprung from the Agile revolution. From idea to implementation, every step can be automated and is very customizable. In the next chapter, we will continue the pipeline by looking at the Release and Configure phases.</p>
