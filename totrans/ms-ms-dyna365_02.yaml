    when multiple requests come simultaneously within the same data plane? This is
    handled in a pretty intelligent way. When a regional control plane is instructed
    to create a new tenant, the management service reserves a buffer tenant in the
    data plane cluster. What is a buffer tenant? Basically, it is a tenant that's
    already been created, with a demo data company inside the database that acts as
    sort of pre-packaged template. Buffer tenants are not bounded to any application
    service (dismounted).

    and, when it's operational, connections are good to go.

    This is pretty easy to explain and understand: create an Azure SQL database, for
    example, within an Sx tier, and, if a customer needs more performance, you just
    have to scale it up to Sx+n, depending on how many resources you need (how fast
    you want your process to finish).'

    the database in Azure SQL, all the resources are allocated, not shared nor released,
    and the customer – or you – has to pay for them, whether you are using them or
    not.

    itself.'

    relies on the Azure SQL Elastic Pools technology. Basically, with Azure SQL Elastic
    Pools, it is possible to define a total amount of resources to be shared within
    the pool and a range (min and max) value for every database tenant. The cloud
    resource governor will distribute the resources wisely within the pool. This is
    very efficient, performant, and cost-effective.
