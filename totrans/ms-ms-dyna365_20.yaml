    into a Dynamics 365 Business Central solution, the aspect of taking an existing
    ISV solution (written with old C/AL code) and moving it to the new extension model, the
    architectural aspects of this, and tips on how to start this process in the right
    way. We will also look at the famous set of third-party tools for AL developers
    that can be useful for developing Dynamics 365 Business Central applications.
