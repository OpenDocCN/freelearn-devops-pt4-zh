			<p>DevOps best practices encourage the adoption of containers as the foundation of cloud-native ecosystems. As containers have become the new de facto standard for packaging applications and their dependencies, understanding how to implement, build, and manage them is now an essential skill for developers, system administrators, and SRE/operations teams. Podman and its companion tools, Buildah and Skopeo, make a great toolset to boost the development, execution, and management of containerized applications. Starting from the basic concepts of containerization and its underlying technologies, this book will help you get your first container up and running with Podman. The book explores the complete toolkit and illustrates the development of new containers, their life cycle management, troubleshooting, and security aspects.</p>
			<p>By the end of <em class="italic">Podman for DevOps</em>, you'll have the skills needed to be able to build and package your applications inside containers as well as deploy, manage, and integrate them with system services.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>The book is for cloud developers looking to learn how to build and package applications inside containers, and system administrators who want to deploy, manage, and integrate containers with system services and orchestration solutions. This book provides a detailed comparison between Docker and Podman to aid you in learning Podman quickly.</p>
