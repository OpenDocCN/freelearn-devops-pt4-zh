- en: DevOps best practices encourage the adoption of containers as the foundation
    of cloud-native ecosystems. As containers have become the new de facto standard
    for packaging applications and their dependencies, understanding how to implement,
    build, and manage them is now an essential skill for developers, system administrators,
    and SRE/operations teams. Podman and its companion tools, Buildah and Skopeo,
    make a great toolset to boost the development, execution, and management of containerized
    applications. Starting from the basic concepts of containerization and its underlying
    technologies, this book will help you get your first container up and running
    with Podman. The book explores the complete toolkit and illustrates the development
    of new containers, their life cycle management, troubleshooting, and security
    aspects.

    to build and package your applications inside containers as well as deploy, manage,
    and integrate them with system services.
