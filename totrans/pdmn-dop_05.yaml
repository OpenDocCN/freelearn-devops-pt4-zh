    with Podman, covering binary installation for the major distributions, system
    configuration files, and a first example container run to verify that our setup
    was correct. This chapter will offer a more detailed overview of container execution,
    how to manage and inspect running containers, and how to group containers in pods.
    This chapter is important for gaining the right knowledge and expertise to start
    our experience as a system administrator for container technologies.

    local system, as well as inspect its contents. When a container is created and
    run for the first time, Podman takes care of pulling the related image automatically.
    However, being able to pull and inspect images in advance gives some valuable
    advantages, the first being that a container executes faster when images are already
    available in the machine's local store.

    latest tag while the latest pushed image could have a different tag. It is up

    *Comparing Podman and Docker*, we talked about the fact that Podman, as with any
    other container engine, leverages the Linux namespace functionality to correctly
    isolate running containers from each other and from the OS host as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, just because Podman creates a brand-new namespace for every running container,
    it should not be a surprise that we can attach to the same Linux namespace of
    a running container, executing other processes just as in a full operating environment.

    the `podman exec` command.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once executed, this command will find internally the right Linux namespace to
    which the target running container is attached. Having found the Linux namespace,
    Podman will execute the respective process, passed as an argument to the `podman
    exec` command, attaching it to the target Linux namespace. The final process will
    be in the same environment as the original process companion and it will be able
    to interact with it.

    and working with an existing container. In the preceding example, we attached

    the standard input stream open even if there is no terminal attached yet (`-i`).

    cases, but this represents an anti-pattern for the container technology. In fact,
    as mentioned before, Kubernetes considers the **pod** the smallest computing unit
    to run on top of the distributed nodes' part of one cluster. This means that once
    you group two or more containers under the same pod, they will be executed together
    on the same node and the orchestrator cannot balance or distribute their workload
    on multiple machines.

    were running, we also explored the various commands available in Podman to inspect
    and check the logs and troubleshoot our containers. The operations needed to monitor
    and look after running containers are really important for any container administrator.
    Finally, we also took a brief look at the Kubernetes concepts available in Podman
    that let us group two or more containers under the same Linux namespace. All the
    concepts and the examples we just went through will help us start our experience
    as a system administrator for container technologies.
