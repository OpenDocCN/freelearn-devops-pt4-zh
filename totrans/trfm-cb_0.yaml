- en: '**Infrastructure as Code**, more commonly known as **IaC**, is a practice that
    is a pillar of DevOps culture. IaC entails writing your desired architecture configuration
    in code. Among other advantages, IaC allows the automation of infrastructure deployments,
    which reduces or eliminates the need for manual intervention, and thus the risk
    of configuration errors, and the need to create templates and standardize infrastructure
    with modular and scalable code.'

    from HashiCorp, which is very popular today because, in addition to being open

    of Terraform for local development, the writing of Terraform configurations, and
    the construction of several environments in a dynamic way.

    and how to share and use Terraform modules.

    discuss Terraform's practical use for building infrastructure in one of the leading
    cloud providers, Azure.

    including Terraform testing, integrating Terraform into a **continuous integration/continuous
    deployment** (**CI/CD**) pipeline, and using Terraform Cloud, which is Terraform's
    collaboration platform for teams and companies.

    Terraform configurations and commands, and it will also cover recipes on Terraform's
    integration with other tools, such as Terragrunt, kitchen-terraform, and Azure
    Pipelines.

    Terraform providers.
