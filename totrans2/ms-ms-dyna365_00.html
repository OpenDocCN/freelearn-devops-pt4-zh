<p class="mce-root">This book is for Dynamics 365 Business Central developers who need to create applications and customizations on top of Microsoft Dynamics <strong>enterprise resource planning</strong><span> (</span><strong>ERP</strong>).</p>
<p>The book starts by explaining the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central platform (the focus is on the <strong>Software-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong>SaaS</strong>) platform) and the modern development environment (Visual Studio Code, the AL language, and other tools, such as Docker). Then the book covers all the developer-oriented topics that you need to know about in order to extend and customize the ERP, with a focus on how to write better code following best practices, how to debug and deploy extensions, and how to write automatic testing.</p>
<p>The book also covers advanced topics related to integration, cloud services, and serverless processing (with Azure Functions, web services, and APIs) using Dynamics 365 Business Central with Office 365 apps such as Power BI, Flow, and PowerApps; integration with machine learning functionalities; and how to apply DevOps techniques to your development process.</p>
<p>The book ends with an <em>architectural</em> topic by analyzing the best ways of moving existing solutions to the new development model based on extensions.</p>
