<p><strong>Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central</strong> is one of the best-in-class pieces of cloud-based <strong>Enterprise Resource Planning</strong> (<strong>ERP</strong>) application software that's targeted at the <strong>small and medium business</strong> (<strong>SMB</strong>) market. The application is based on the <strong>Software-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong>SaaS</strong>) model, and it is sold through <strong>Cloud Solution Provider</strong> (<strong>CSP</strong>) partners.</p>
<p>Potential customers can spin up a trial tenant at any time and/or contact a CSP partner to purchase and assign a per-user license.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer perspective</strong>: What Dynamics 365 Business Central is, what functional areas it covers, and licensing</li>
<li><strong>Partner perspective</strong>: An overview of Business Central Admin Center and its use</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft perspective</strong>: A deep dive under the technological skin of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central</li>
<li><span><strong>A future perspective</strong></span>: <span>What to potentially expect in the upcoming years and how to contribute to making it happen</span></li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clear and in-depth overview of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central platform.</p>

<p>Targeted at SMBs, the core design of Dynamics 365 Business Central relies on Microsoft Azure and the Office 365 platforms. The application's core code and business processes come from the evolution of 30+ years of feature enhancements of Microsoft Dynamics NAV (mostly known as <em>Navision</em>): one of the most solid pieces of on-premise ERP software in the SMB domain.</p>
<p>Potential customers <span>–</span> or those who simply want to give the application a spin—can subscribe for fast setup with a trial version through <a href="https://trials.dynamics.com/Dynamics365/Signup/BusinessCentral">https://trials.dynamics.com/Dynamics365/Signup/BusinessCentral</a> by providing an email address that's bound to an Office 365 subscription and a phone number. After 30 days, when the trial period ends, the product needs to be purchased.</p>
<p>Official licensing is assigned exclusively through Microsoft Partners that are credited and certified by the CSP program. Simply browse through <a href="https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/business-central/overview/">https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/business-central/overview/</a> and click on <span class="packt_screen">Find a partner</span> under the desired licensing module, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/90336d57-47ec-475d-8175-086c58abdc87.png"/></p>
<p>Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central delivers out of the box functionalities in modules with a fixed price per month, per user. There are three types of per user/month choices with different capabilities and application modules: Essentials, Premium, and Team Members. Essentials and Premium are full users, while Team Members are just additional users with limited capabilities.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>These are the properties (collection of capabilities) of the <em>Essentials</em> module (from $70 per month):</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial management</li>
<li>Customer relationship management</li>
<li>Project management</li>
<li>Supply chain management</li>
<li>Human resource management</li>
<li>Warehouse management</li>
</ul>
<p><span>These are the properties of the </span>Premium module (from $100 per month):</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial management</li>
<li>Customer relationship management</li>
<li>Project management</li>
<li>Supply chain management</li>
<li>Human resource management</li>
<li>Warehouse management</li>
<li>Service management</li>
<li>Manufacturing</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, it is not possible to have a mixed user experience of both Essential and Premium within the same tenant. It is possible to move from the Essential to the Premium module, but you can't downgrade from Premium to Essential. If you have already at least one user licensed as Essential or Premium, it is possible to have an external user added as a named license <em>Team Member</em> within the same module (Essential or Premium).</p>
<p>This is what you get as a Team Member (from $8 per month):</p>
<ul>
<li>Essential or Premium (depending on the module of the user that has added the Team Member).</li>
<li>The ability to consume data or reports, complete light tasks such as time or expense entries and HR record updates, and use PowerApps for Dynamics 365.</li>
<li>Technically, they might have read access to all the tables but only have insert/update access to a maximum of three tables.</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox">All the details related to the licensing types and what they include are described in the official Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide (the latest review at the time of writing was October <span>2019</span>), which can be found at <a href="https://mbs.microsoft.com/Files/public/365/Dynamics365BusinessCentralLicensingGuide.pdf">https://mbs.microsoft.com/Files/public/365/Dynamics365BusinessCentralLicensingGuide.pdf</a>.<a href="https://mbs.microsoft.com/Files/public/365/Dynamics365BusinessCentralLicensingGuide.pdf"/></div>
<p>Once the customer gets started with their trial or production tenants, they will be offered a productive, intuitive, and user-friendly web client interface, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f1c17d82-5a33-4c3c-b0bf-eaf95a37ecb5.png"/></p>
<p>The best browser experience is offered by Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.</p>
<p>Customers can also benefit from the universal app deployment type in almost every modern device, such as tablets, phablets, and phones. This is achieved by downloading an app (known as Dynamics 365 Business Central Universal App) from the Windows Store, Google Play, or the Apple Store. To install the mobile app, go to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/install-mobile-app">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/install-mobile-app</a>.</p>
<p>Upon opening this website, we get three options for installing the mobile app. You can install it from Microsoft, download it from the Apple Store, or get it from the Google Play Store. The following is a snippet of the screen you'll see when you select to install the app from Microsoft:</p>

<p>Starting from the October 2018 update, CSP partners can now create their own localized versions for countries where Dynamics 365 Business Central has not been released or is not on the radar as a Microsoft localization.</p>
<p>These localizations start with the worldwide standard application base (called W1) and are distributed as extensions through the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Marketplace, called AppSource. Like any extension (or app) that's deployed through AppSource, all the application and technical support is provided by the partner who sells the app through AppSource.</p>

<p>CSP enables partners to access a portfolio of Microsoft cloud services to be sold. Within this program, there are tools for managing and supporting these cloud services. One of these online services is Dynamics 365 Business Central.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">You can find out more about the Partner Center at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/csp-overview">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/csp-overview</a>.</div>
<p>In the SaaS proposition, it is only through the CSP partners or their resellers that a potential customer could purchase licenses for Dynamics 365 Business Central and convert the trial license into a pay-per-use license or start <span>by </span>directly paying the monthly fee for the users.</p>
<p>In every CSP, a partner or reseller is technically represented by a unique tenant record in the <strong>Azure Active Directory</strong> (<strong>AAD</strong>). <span>AAD is a multi-tenant authentication service that offers identity and access capabilities for applications running in Microsoft Azure and Microsoft on-premises environments.</span></p>
<p>Within this specific AAD tenant record, a partner can define a different type or class of users (often called supporting agents) that are mainly categorized into two different groups (so-called agent groups): <em>Admin</em> and <em>Helpdesk</em> groups.</p>
<p>Like partners, customers also have their own AAD tenant unique record. When subscribing to an Essential or Premium plan within a Dynamics 365 Business Central tenant, every customer gives consent for a special trusted relationship between the CSP partner and the customer AAD tenants.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">The relationship's direction goes from customer tenant to partner tenant, and it can be revoked and/or managed by the customer if needed.</div>
<p>In the customer, AAD tenants, user, role, and subscription entities <span>are defined and </span>managed. Roles are assigned to users by the customers and these roles reflect their capabilities in the products that they subscribe to. Subscribing to an online product such as Dynamics 365 Business Central in the customer AAD tenant requires the further important step of <span>the CSP partner </span>assigning the specific online product license to the users.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>These tasks are performed through the <strong>Business Central Admin</strong> portal. This portal can be accessed directly by the customer or the CSP partner. The CSP partner may also have access via the <strong>Partner Center</strong> portal:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>With the</span> Partner Center portal, there are several ways to browse to the Dynamics 365 Business Central Admin Center portal. One of these is from the <span class="packt_screen">Service Management</span> tab. The <span class="packt_screen">Service Management</span> tab contains links to various admin portals related to a specific customer AAD tenant, such as Exchange or Office 365. It also displays the service health status for products that the portals or administrator consoles refer to, such as Exchange Online, Identity Service, and Dynamics 365 Business Central.</li>
<li>By clicking on the Dynamics 365 Business Central link, the partner will be redirected straight to the Dynamics 365 Business Central Admin Center portal. Back in the Partner Center portal, the CSP partner is also able to check the customer's order history and see which subscriptions they belong to. It is also possible to select the Dynamics 365 Business Central billing frequency <span>–</span> such as monthly or once per year <span>–</span> and subscribes to different online services on behalf of that customer.</li>
<li>The subscriptions are divided per offering type (level). As an example, within Dynamics 365 Business Central, it is possible to choose the Essential or the Premium plan.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Users and licenses</span> <span>section, the CSP partner can add users manually or upload many of them from a file. For every user, a different service license can be assigned.</span></li>
<li>Once a license has been assigned, the user can start working with Dynamics 365 Business Central and will have the app listed on their home page at <a href="http://home.dynamics.com">home.dynamics.com</a><span>. Clicking on the Dynamics 365 Business Central icon redirects the user to their first login, and they can start working immediately in the production tenant. </span>You may notice that the URL definition benefits from an easy to identify fixed client endpoint and customer tenant, and its Dynamics 365 Business Central Admin portal should look like this:
<ul>
<li>Customer tenant: <a href="https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/GUID">https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/</a><a href="https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/%3cGUID%3e/admin">&lt;GUID&gt;</a><a href="https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/GUID"/></li>
<li>Customer tenant admin portal: <a href="https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/%3cGUID%3e/admin">https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/&lt;GUID&gt;/admin</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>GUID identifies the same customer environment that you came from in the Partner Center portal.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Since the Fall 2019 update, if you have multiple production environments, when you click on the Dynamics 365 Business Central icon on the home page (<a href="http://home.dynamics.com">home.dynamics.com</a>), you will be prompted to select which environment name to choose. The environment endpoint should look like <a href="https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/%3CGUID%3E/%3CEnvironmentName%3E">https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/&lt;EnvironmentName&gt;</a>.</div>
<p>So, who can access the Dynamics 365 Business Central Admin Center portal? The answer is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSP Partner Admin and Helpdesk agents who have an active entitled relationship with the customer tenant</li>
<li>The customer's AAD Global Administrator</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox">Dynamics 365 Business Central licensed users won't be able to access the administration portal. There is no relationship between the product license and Dynamics 365 Business Central Admin Center portal access.</div>
<p>The customer's AAD tenant Global Administrator can sign in, and partner AAD tenant Administrators and Helpdesk users can access as a Delegated Admin. Delegated Admins can perform elevated tasks as Partner, but they do not have the same rights that the customer's Global Administrator has. In short, Delegated Admins are not Global Administrators of the tenant.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As a quick example, a Delegated Admin cannot create a new company in the customer tenant but should ask the customer administrator (with SUPER rights) to create a new company or be promoted by the customer in order to add the appropriate Dynamics 365 Business Central permission rights. Once the new company has been created, the Delegated Admin can sign in and perform the administrative tasks they are entitled to.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Partner Delegated Admins can sign in to a specific customer tenant that they have a relationship with by just typing the Dynamics 365 Business Central fixed endpoint, <a href="https://businesscentral.dynamics.com">https://businesscentral.dynamics.com</a>, followed by the customer tenant's AAD name (for example, <a href="https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/customerAADtenantname.onmicrosoft.com">https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/customerAADtenantname.onmicrosoft.com</a> ). This is necessary because the partner may be dealing with several customer administrative tasks and may need to connect, disconnect, and reconnect as quickly as they can during their daily activities.</p>
<p>The Dynamics 365 Business Central Admin Center portal currently contains four sections (<em><strong><span class="packt_screen">Environments</span></strong></em>, <em><strong><span class="packt_screen">Notification recipients</span></strong></em>, <strong><em><span class="packt_screen">Telemetry</span></em></strong>, and <span class="packt_screen">Reported Outages</span>), as depicted in the sidebar in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/44e1ae40-fd0e-4389-b7f0-36a296be1434.png"/></p>
<p>We'll look at each of these in the upcoming sections.</p>

<p><span class="packt_screen">Environments</span> list all the Dynamics 365 Business Central production and sandbox tenants for a specific customer. For each of these, it shows the status, provisioning country, version, and upgrade window.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the possible actions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New.</strong> Create a new production or tenant sandbox. Currently, it is possible to create up to three production tenants for the same or different countries and up to three sandbox tenants for the same or different countries. It is possible to create sandboxes as copies of production databases.
<div class="packt_infobox">Depending on the amount of data in the production tenant, the operation of creating a sandbox from the production tenant could be a lengthy process.</div>
</li>
<li><strong>Delete</strong>. You could select a sandbox or production tenant for deletion.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time of writing, the possible actions for a specific tenant are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set update window.</strong> Configure an update window in local time for a specific tenant. The update window lets you select a start time and an end time. It is down to Microsoft to send a notification right after the update happened. The notification typically contains details of whether the update has been performed successfully or if it failed, and for what reason it failed. If the update failed, an actionable report of the failure will be added in the notification in order for the partner and/or customer to act upon it.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule Update</strong>. When a new update is available, a notification is sent by Microsoft to the admin center recipients and through this action, it is possible to schedule the update. </li>
<li><strong>Delete</strong><span>. Delete the current production or sandbox tenant.</span></li>
<li><strong>Report Production Outage</strong><span>. This is a new addition since the Fall 2019 update. If users are not able to connect to a production environment, just by pushing the production outage button, it is possible to file a record (ticket) into the request for immediate help to the Dynamics 365 Business Central operations center. This ticket will be highly prioritized so that the issue can be resolved in a timely manner.</span></li>
<li><strong>Manage Support Contact</strong><span>. This is used to add the support contact for one specific environment. Users will see this information on the <span class="packt_screen">Business Central Help &amp; Support</span> page. It is possible to choose different support contacts for each tenant or just one that fits all.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>Since Microsoft is constantly adding new actions, it has been announced that the following will come after the official release in October 2019:</span></span></p>
<ul>

<p>Notification recipients list all the Dynamics 365 Business Central notification recipients for a specific customer. The list shows the recipients' names and email addresses. These users will be notified when a special life cycle tenant task is completed, such as when a minor update is applied or when an upgrade to a new application version is available.</p>
<p>This is useful if you want developers and testers to be notified when something has happened, or will happen soon, to a specified tenant in order to give them enough time to review their custom development against the new standard application code.</p>

<p>This shows a filter pane with date, time, and event types for a specific customer.</p>
<p>It is possible to set filters to a specific environment (production or sandbox) and go back in time by specifying the number of minutes to look back. The list reports the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timestamp</strong>: A value that represents when exactly the operation was logged.</li>
<li><strong>Level</strong>: An integer value that shows errors, warnings, and information.</li>
<li><strong>Opcode Name</strong>: The type of application operation (for example, start or stop).</li>
<li><strong>Object Type and ID</strong>: This represents the type and ID of the object that generated the log.</li>
<li><strong>Object Extension Name and ID</strong>: If no value is displayed, it means that the telemetry log comes directly from legacy application code (C/AL).</li>
<li><strong>Function Name</strong>: This represents the name of the object function that generated the log.</li>
<li><strong>Failure Message</strong>: If no value is displayed, this typically means that this is an information message about a start or stop operation that happened to a specific object function.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the specified time range, it is also possible to search in columns for a specific operation or an error message. This is frequently used in sandbox or staging environments to find out whether there are inconsistencies or runtime errors between the standard base app and <span><span>custom extensions that have been developed</span></span>.</p>

<p>This is a new addition with the Fall 2019 update. It reports a list of the production outage tickets and their status. It is possible to filter for the last 30, 14 or 7 days.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">More information on this is available at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center</a>.</div>
<p>Aside from client logins and performing activities through the portal's <strong>user interface</strong> (<strong>UI</strong>), the Partner Center and Dynamics 365 Business Central Admin Portals expose a set of powerful APIs that could be used to create a custom façade to handle customer creation, license assignment, and other tasks in a modern and fully automated way.</p>
<p>Even with basic knowledge of PowerShell or Visual C# and without any high-level development skills, it is possible to take the first step toward creating your own tailored dashboard and an automated way to create new customer users, assign or revoke licenses, and so on.</p>
<p>For example, we could use the following endpoint: <a href="https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v1.2/admin/applications/BusinessCentral/environments/Sandbox">https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v1.2/admin/applications/BusinessCentral/environments/Sandbox</a>.<a href="https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v1.1/admin/applications/BusinessCentral/environments/Sandbox"/></p>

<p>The fixed web service endpoint global service is called and redirects the information to the global tenant manager global service, which will do its broadcast and find out which regional control plane, data plane, and tenant the request belongs to.</p>
<p>After retrieving the required information, the fixed web service endpoint will pass requests back and forth directly to the regional control plane that was selected. In other words, the global services only performed the first routing information task (a simple proxy task).</p>
<p>The fixed web service endpoint, when routed to communicate with the specific regional control plane, will start interacting with the tenant admin backend service.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, some partners have already implemented the Dynamics 365 Partner Center SDK in their own projects and have consumed these APIs within Dynamics 365 Business Central on-premise environments (using .NET interoperability) in order to have a fully integrated customer tenant management dashboard. This can also be done for demonstration purposes.</p>
<p>Now that we have unleashed some of the best features that are provided to Microsoft's partners, let's have an overview of what Dynamics 365 Business Central <span>is</span><span> </span><span>under the hood.</span></p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Microsoft invested a lot in the last year and continues to invest in a modernized and streamlined Dynamics 365 Business Central architecture in order to have an <span>ERP cloud service solution that is </span>easy to deploy and upgrade.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, statistics are very encouraging and even exceed expectations.</p>
<p>Basically, a new Dynamics 365 Business Central tenant is created every 180 seconds. 400,000 metrics are emitted per minute, with approximately 8 TB of logs <span>generated </span>per day. These logs are then pre-processed, aggregated, and approximately 4 TB data is uploaded to Cosmos DB for big data analysis via the Azure Data Lake service.</p>
<p>These are just some of the numbers that Dynamics 365 Business Central is producing, and just a few of the Microsoft cloud services that are used to provide the best online ERP experience in the world.</p>
<p>At this pace, in the near future, it might be foreseeable that <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> (<strong>AI</strong>) could be used to self-trigger microservice tuning at all platform and application levels.</p>
<p>Going a bit deeper, considering that Azure technologies are involved, at the time of writing, there are 20 resources that are orchestrated together in every single microservice collection. This goes to show what a complex environment is provided to users and developers in the simplest way possible.</p>
<p>The Dynamics 365 Business Central development team's main goal is to move <span>the extensibility burden </span><span>to the partners</span> <span>and the customers. </span>Partners and customers have to completely forget about where and how the data is stored, as well as the technologies that are required to gather, transform, and upgrade it. Instead, they should simply concentrate on extending the application. No platform skills are required; simply hit refresh and repeat "developers, developers, developers..."</p>
<p>Here is a tabular overview of the Azure resources that are used to build each platform service, their purposes, and links to more information about each resource:</p>

<p>Global services are just a few services that don't store any data and <span>only </span>perform processing activities. They are just proxies that don't hold any data and are used to redirect requests to the appropriate control and data planes.</p>
<p>Global services are mainly used to redirect requests to the appropriate control planes; in fact, they are simply routing the information when users are logging in. The fixed client endpoint is responsible for routing to the appropriate control and data plane <span>based on credentials</span>. No other extra information is needed.</p>
<p>There are several global services in different world regions with multiple instances, but they are all accessed from within the same endpoint. A traffic manager in front of them redirects the call to the closest instance where the calls come from. This makes the Dynamics 365 Business Central service very efficient and performant. Statistically, 30,000 calls per hour are routed through Dynamics 365 Business Central global services. Next, let's understand where and how these work.</p>

<p>These are collections of microservices that have their own purposes and perform specific tasks (provisioning, scale, monitoring, and authentication, for example) to manage application access, distribution, and runtime. They are all built-in and managed by Azure Service Fabric. Each region has a subset of these services, and they are called regional services because they follow the same privacy and legal guidelines of the country or region of the world they belong to.</p>
<p>There are two benefits of this:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>P</span>rivacy and security laws in that specific region are respected when it comes to data handling.</li>
<li><span>Closeness to</span> data storage means that latency is reduced and network performance is increased.</li>
</ul>
<p>A control plane is a collection of services that manage a specific data plane. For this reason, they are located and distributed in the same region as the data planes.</p>
<p>The following are the services that currently make up a control plan:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Database Monitor</strong>: Used to monitor a tenant's and application databases' health and upload telemetry and statistics into the internal analysis tool.</span></li>
<li><strong>Elastic Pool Optimizer</strong>: Extracts statistics from elastic pools and uploads them into internal tools.</li>
<li><strong>Extension Management Service</strong>: This is the core service of the control plane and is where the sync daemon routes and finalizes service calls. <span>Roughly speaking, it is an information container. It has a registry of all the data plane clusters and inventories (which tenants are in which cluster, and so on). Its duty is to create, upgrade, and manage tenants on demand. Typically, this service acts upon sync daemon requests or from other services in the regional control plane.</span></li>
<li><strong>Extension Validation Service</strong>: Compiles the per-tenant extensions against upcoming application services. This will determine whether the changes in the base application that are coming will break the private IP that was created for that tenant. These errors could be surfaced to the partner through the CSP partner portal.</li>
<li><strong>Health Monitor</strong>: Keeps track of the state of the tenant and, if it detects an unhealthy ping, it sends an internal alert.</li>
<li><strong>Management Portal</strong>: Internal dashboard portal based on the Dynamics 365 Business Central web client platform. It manages customer tenants and provides a UI to perform actions over these tenants.</li>
<li><strong>Management Service</strong>: The heart of service orchestration. It contains a catalog of what kind of activity could/should be performed by the tenant. Some of these include create, copy, upgrade, and delete.</li>
<li><strong>Provisioning Service</strong>: Historically, it was made of a collection of PowerShell scripts for Azure VM provisioning. Nowadays, it is mainly used to perform extension validations.</li>
<li><strong>Sync Daemon</strong>: This is one of the oldest services for Dynamics 365 Business Central. Global services typically talk to this service in the regional control planes and it determines whether to create a new tenant or route to the appropriate data plane. It has an operations database that is used to enqueue requests of creating new tenants, just in case it cannot be served immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Tenant Admin Backend Service</strong>: Performs activities related to the admin center. For example, it is responsible for validating web service requests, such as the integrity of the content and the business logic of the content.</li>
<li><strong>Tenant Buffering Service</strong>: This is typically handled by the management service. It is constantly checking how many tenants have been created and replaces the number of buffer tenants with new ones to cope with peak periods and maintain the right balance between brand new tenant creation and the assignment of existing tenants.</li>
<li><strong>Tenant Maintenance Service</strong>: <span>Used for tenant maintenance. For example, when a customer decides to move from a trial to a paid subscription, this service kicks in. The maintenance service will then move the tenant from the Standard tier to a more performant Premium tier. If a trial expires or a license is removed in the AAD, or the customer stops paying, the maintenance service will put the tenant in a suspended state. There is a 90-day period to redeem the tenant, but this may vary, depending on the data retention policy in each country. After this grace period, the tenant is dismounted from the service tier and, after a while, it's deleted.</span></li>
<li><strong>Tenant Upgrader</strong>: <span>Schedules and triggers update jobs in a time upgrade window specified by the CSP partner. Currently, the date when the tenant will be upgraded is decided by Microsoft and cannot be changed.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The development team is constantly adding new services or splitting existing ones to make room for new features or to optimize the maintenance and scalability of Dynamics 365 Business Central. In the next section, we will see what regional data planes work with these.</p>

<p><span><span>Regional data planes are collections of services that enable safe customer data storage.</span></span> It is important to save data in the same country in Azure data centers that are close to the customers, as well as in the same privacy and compliance region of the customer. Data safety is very important. As an example, two<span><span> data planes have been created in the Western Europe region, both of which are supported by four data centers</span></span>. They are standard and publicly available, and everyone <span>–</span> including the development team <span>–</span> can make use of them and unleash the potential of the Azure services, their APIs, and their extensibility.</p>
<p>In SaaS solutions, it is very important to work on isolated microservices in order to quickly deploy updates and changes in segments. The same applies to data planes, where scheduled updates can be applied with the required atomicity through what are called internally safe deployment practices.</p>
<p>Data plane resources are all reserved for handling customer data. These are constantly measured using an amazing number of telemetry parameters. All the management of data planes, such as creating and upgrading tenants, is performed by other regional entities called control planes.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the current regional data planes (as of October 2019) and the localized version they are hosting:</p>

<p>A data plane cluster contains all the redundant VMs and Azure SQL databases for the application and customer tenants. Currently, high availability is guaranteed by load balancing five Azure VMs per data plan.</p>
<p>Since these statistics demonstrate the generation of a tenant roughly every three minutes, how is <span>it</span><span> </span><span>possible to cope with and scale to such a high volume when multiple requests come simultaneously within the same data plane? This is handled in a pretty intelligent way. When a regional control plane is instructed to create a new tenant, the management service reserves a buffer tenant in the data plane cluster. What is a buffer tenant? Basically, it is a tenant that's already been created, with a demo data company inside the database that acts as sort of pre-packaged template. Buffer tenants are not bounded to any application service (dismounted).</span> <span> </span></p>
<p>When a buffer tenant is reserved, it is not able to be taken by any other management service call and it is transformed into a production tenant by simply changing some configuration parameters and adding the production company name for a specific customer. Once this is done, the tenant is mounted against a production service and, when it's operational, connections are good to go.</p>
<p>In short: reserve, configure, mount, operational, and it's good to go. No lengthy database creations or restore processes.</p>
<p>Currently, data plane cluster environments in production and sandbox environments are different. This is because of the different environment's natures and their needs. They are mainly different in terms of performance because of the different Azure SQL database tier. Trial and sandbox tenants currently belong to the Azure S-tier. When switched to production, these are moved to the more performant, and recommended by Azure SQL Team, P-tier.</p>

<p>A single data plane cluster is an aggregate of Microsoft cloud technologies that's logically divided into the Compute and Data tier. Let's explore the anatomy of a data plane:</p>

<p>The entire Azure VM set is defined inside the same availability set. This means that if there is a hardware failure, it won't affect all the VMs at the same time, guaranteeing high service availability.</p>
<p>Every VM inside a VM scale set contains a Dynamics 365 Business Central Web Server and Dynamics 365 Business Central. This helps optimize traffic between web servers and Dynamics 365 Business Central.</p>
<p>Every Azure VM also contains a monitoring service to collect telemetry data and licensing services to avoid storing certificate private keys that are used to access AAD tenants.</p>

<p>Network Security Group</p>
</td>

<p>This is mainly used to provide an extra security layer to each cluster.

<p>In other words, the safety of data handling is totally guaranteed.</p>

<p>After understanding this exhaustive list, let's move on and look at the Data-tier level.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Data-tier</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The simplest data tier is the so-called per-single or individual database. This is pretty easy to explain and understand: create an Azure SQL database, for example, within an Sx tier, and, if a customer needs more performance, you just have to scale it up to Sx+n, depending on how many resources you need (how fast you want your process to finish).</p>
<p>The drawback with individual databases is that, by the time you have created the database in Azure SQL, all the resources are allocated, not shared nor released, and the customer – or you – has to pay for them, whether you are using them or not.</p>
<p>When you have thousands (or hundreds of thousands) of databases to handle, like in every multi-tenant class A product, the resource placement design should be smart enough to know when to assign or release resources at need. Otherwise, this will turn into a cost-killer product for everyone: customers, partners, and Microsoft itself.</p>
<p>Dynamics 365 Business Central database resource allocation is intelligent. It relies on the Azure SQL Elastic Pools technology. Basically, with Azure SQL Elastic Pools, it is possible to define a total amount of resources to be shared within the pool and a range (min and max) value for every database tenant. The cloud resource governor will distribute the resources wisely within the pool. This is very efficient, performant, and cost-effective.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning that there are <strong>Standard</strong> (<strong>Sx</strong>) and <strong>Premium</strong> (<strong>Px</strong>) Elastic Pool data tiers. When needed, tenants from Sx are moved to a more performant Px pool.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<div class="packt_infobox">All the production databases are currently running in the Px elastic pool data tier.</div>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><span><span>The data tier is accessed through a WCF-based <strong>Navision Service Tier</strong> (<strong>NST</strong>) that's installed inside another microservice called VM Scale Set. <span><span>The following is the current</span></span></span></span> anatomy of a single VM scale set:</p>

<p>Azure and Office 365 are now considered solid and mature and have a considerable <strong>Returns On Investment</strong> (<strong>ROI</strong>) for customers.</p>
<p>They are among the best sources of revenue for Microsoft and where the most investment and capital is redirected. All Microsoft services are requested to align with Microsoft's strategy of increasing the consumption of these two flagship services.</p>
<p>Dynamics 365 Business Central perfectly fits into Microsoft's strategy: it brings new <span>potential </span>SMB ERP customers into this offering to accelerate the best-in-class Microsoft cloud service consumption. </p>
<p>In other words, potential Dynamics NAV and Dynamics GP customers are strongly encouraged to subscribe to Dynamics 365 Business Central's Essential or Premium tier instead of receiving a typical offering for an on-premise deployment.</p>
<p><span>A huge product transformation to drive online adoption </span><span>has been announced at the latest Microsoft and non-Microsoft events. These actions are mainly aligned with existing Dynamics NAV and Dynamics 365 Business Central on-premise customers. The following is the current roadmap for the product that was recently presented at <strong>Directions EMEA</strong> (<a href="https://www.directionsemea.com/">https://www.directionsemea.com/</a>): </span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9bced2fe-3228-4297-bc86-e189c6475aaf.png"/></p>
<p>With the Fall 2019 release, Microsoft achieved the challenging goal of reducing the gap between on-premise and online deployment. Both products deployment capabilities are now almost the same:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Modern clients only</strong>: No more Windows client deployment for on-premise releases.</li>
<li><strong>Extension development only</strong>: No more legacy code changes through CSIDE or mixed-mode for on-premise releases. Standard code changes can only be done on-premises, even if these should be avoided as much as possible. More information can be found at <span><a href="http://www.waldo.be/2019/08/06/al-baseapp-customization-because-you-can-doesnt-mean-you-should/">http://www.waldo.be/2019/08/06/al-baseapp-customization-because-you-can-doesnt-mean-you-should/</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The current plan from the development team, according to their announcement, is to move the existing legacy C/AL code into AL and provide standard code as Microsoft localized extensions or, more feasibly, as a series of dependent apps.</p>
<p>In this way, both on-premise and online client access will be roughly the same in terms of both user and development experience. The difference between on-premise and online, then, will be really small, and moving from on-premise to online in a single step will be far easier.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Since this journey is a continuous work in progress, Dynamics 365 Business Central's development team is wide open and listens to all customer and partner requests with a proactive and reactive service. This has been done to cover all the different perspectives and points of view. In the upcoming sections, we'll look at exactly how Microsoft listens to and acts upon customer and partner requests.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Suggestions for new features and enhancing existing features and capabilities:</strong> This <span>directly </span>creates an internal record to Dynamics 365 Business Central's engineering backlog. You can also vote for existing suggestions, and this elevates prioritization and rankings for that specific feature. It is directly handled by the development team (<a href="https://aka.ms/bcideas">https://aka.ms/bcideas</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Bugs or errors found in application or platform PREVIEW or BETA versions:  </strong>Only for <strong>Independent Software Vendor</strong> (<strong>ISV</strong>)/<strong>Value Added Resellers</strong> (<strong>VAR</strong>). Note that no advisory or consultancy requests are accepted (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/collaborate/">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/collaborate/</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Bugs or errors found in PREVIEW or BETA versions of AL in Visual Studio Code:<em> </em></strong>It should be noted that no advisory or consultancy requests are accepted (<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/al">https://github.com/microsoft/al</a>). </li>

<p><strong>Function Expose requests </strong>will be added to the release in preview and not to the current online version.

<p>These are the Microsoft rules for reactive scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bugs or errors found in applications or platforms for versions in General Availability (GA) and in mainstream support: </strong><span>Only for  </span><span>ISVs/VARs that have an <strong>Advanced Support for Partners</strong> (<strong>ASfP</strong>) contract with Microsoft.</span></li>
<li><strong>Backport new events or functions exposed in versions currently in GA and in mainstream support: </strong>Online customers must contact their seller or CSP partner to receive support and/or ask them to file a reactive support request.</li>
</ul>
<div class="mce-root packt_infobox">More information can be found here: <a href="https://community.dynamics.com/business/b/financials/archive/2018/12/04/find-the-right-resources-and-provide-feedback">https://community.dynamics.com/business/b/financials/archive/2018/12/04/find-the-right-resources-and-provide-feedback</a>.</div>
<p>All in all, considering the existing customers that still are on-premise with Dynamics NAV and Dynamics GP, the best suggestions we can provide to customer and partner organizations are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use and request events.</li>
<li>Move all the existing private IPs outside the standard code with event-driven development as much as possible. If this requires new events in the standard application, request them through the appropriate channel.</li>
<li>Move legacy code into extensions.</li>
<li>Whatever can be isolated into event-driven development can also be packaged as an extension. Move as many private IPs as possible into an extension. This task has a widely accepted technical term called <em>SaaSification</em>.</li>
<li>Refactor all the code to make <span>it</span> work in the web client and focus all the skills on web-based development.</li>
<li>Make the web client your main client and switch your mind to web-oriented development.</li>
<li>Train all your salespeople, installers, developers, functional application experts, and everyone else who's using or demoing the web client. Live and breathe using the Dynamics 365 Business Central web client.</li>
<li>Collaborate and use social media.</li>
<li>Stay up to date on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Yammer. Take note of your own business process showstopper and share it with the Dynamics 365 Business Central community and development team by actively participating in official and unofficial forums and dedicated product events.</li>
<li>Last but not least, mainly for partners and freelancers, get used to and specialize in modern technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>We suggest that developers acquire skills related to the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio Code and AL</li>
<li>JavaScript and web-based development</li>
<li>AI and machine learning techniques</li>
<li>Azure services for developers (such as Azure Functions and Cognitive Service)</li>
<li>Git and Azure DevOps</li>
</ul>
<p>Developers and architects should become familiar with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Docker containers</li>
<li>Azure compute services (such as Azure VMs and Azure Storage)</li>
<li>Office 365 services and Dynamics 365</li>
<li><strong>Common Data Model</strong> (<strong>CDM</strong>)/<strong>Common Data Service</strong> (<strong>CDS</strong>)</li>
</ul>
