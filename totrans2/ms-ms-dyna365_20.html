<p>In this section, we <span>will cover the integration of machine learning functionalities into a Dynamics 365 Business Central solution, the aspect of taking an existing ISV solution (written with old C/AL code) and moving it to the new extension model, the architectural aspects of this, and tips on how to start this process in the right way. We will also look at the famous set of third-party tools for AL developers that can be useful for developing Dynamics 365 Business Central applications.</span></p>
