<p>Waldo's real name is Eric Wauters and he is one of the founding partners of <em>iFacto Business Solutions</em> and <em>Cloud Ready Software</em>. With his 18 years of technical expertise, he is an everyday inspiration to its development teams. As a development manager, he continually acts upon the technical readiness of iFacto and CRS.</p>
<p>Apart from that, Eric is also very active in the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central community, where he tries to solve technical issues and shares his knowledge with other Dynamics enthusiasts. Surely, a lot of you will have read some of Eric's posts, which he invariably signs with <kbd>waldo</kbd>.</p>
<p>Lots of people have been using and even contributing to tools he shares for free on MiBuSo, GitHub, the PowerShell Gallery, and the Visual Studio Marketplace.</p>
<p>His proven track record led to him being given a <strong><span>Microsoft Most Valuable Professional</span></strong> (<strong>MVP</strong>) award each year since 2007.</p>
<p>After learning about Waldo, in the next section, we'll see an overview of most of his tools for AL developers.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">What tools to use</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Over the years, Waldo has created quite a lot of tools. The first tool Waldo ever put online was back in 2004, <kbd>WaldoNavPad</kbd>, a tool that helps to work with bigger texts in Microsoft Dynamics NAV. It helped to break up code into smaller pieces, which was necessary because, back then, we could only have a maximum of 250 characters in one field. </p>
<p>The tool was downloaded over 11,000 times from MiBuSo. Because of its popularity, Waldo updated the tool to a version that worked in the RTC and as an AL extension, where he extended the functionality a bit to have an HTML editor inside Business Central.</p>
<p>Following this tool, quite a few minor tools made it to the download list of MiBuSo, which you can find at <a href="https://mibuso.com/downloads/results?keywords=waldo">https://mibuso.com/downloads/results?keywords=waldo</a>.</p>
<p>Since 2013, when Microsoft released more and more PowerShell building blocks, Waldo decided to dive into that to help the uptake in the community. This resulted in some very extended libraries of helper functions, which are categorized and published on the PowerShell Gallery. Just search for <kbd>waldo</kbd> (<a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages?q=waldo">https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages?q=waldo</a>) and you will find six PowerShell modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>Ready.Software.SQL</kbd>: These include some functions that help you to work with SQL Server (and Business Central), such as taking backups and restoring them.</li>
<li><kbd>Ready.Software.PowerShell</kbd>: This is a very small set of functions for some PowerShell-related challenges.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><kbd>Ready.Software.Windows</kbd>: These include Windows-related functions such as zipping and unzipping items.</li>
<li><kbd>Ready.Software.NAV</kbd>: This module contains most functions, all related to NAV (Business Central):
<ul>
<li>Working with objects (upgrade, version list, languages, and so on)</li>
<li>Working with servers (such as permissions and companies)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><kbd>RemoteNAVDockerHostHelper</kbd>: This is a module to help you to work with a <kbd>DockerHost</kbd> when that <kbd>DockerHost</kbd> is not on your local PC (hence the word <kbd>Remote</kbd> in <kbd>RemoteNAVDockerHost</kbd>).</li>
<li><kbd>NavContainerHelperExtension</kbd>: This is just a set of functions that Waldo needed to work with Docker. Similar to <kbd>NavContainerHelper</kbd>, these functions were not part of that module at the time they were created.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these functions have had a purpose in Waldo's life as a developer. Every single script in which he uses these modules is online on his GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/waldo1001/Cloud.Ready.Software.PowerShell">https://github.com/waldo1001/Cloud.Ready.Software.PowerShell</a>. You will find all modules there and the scripts in which he puts these modules to use.</p>
<p>A large number of these PowerShell scripts were created to be able to help the development of <span>V1</span><span> </span><span>Extensions. But when these were discontinued (for the better), there was a new kid on the block: Visual Studio Code, in which we can develop for what we call Extensions V2. In Waldo's opinion, this tool needed some help with the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically naming files</li>
<li>Running objects</li>
<li>Snippets</li>
</ul>
<p>So, Waldo started to build an extension for Visual Studio Code to help AL developers to do their jobs more efficiently. The <strong>CRS AL Language Extension</strong> was born: <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=waldo.crs-al-language-extension">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=waldo.crs-al-language-extension</a>.</p>
<p>This is just a peek at Waldo's tools and how he came to build them. Here are a few resources where you can find his tools:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>In this chapter, we will talk about a few of his tools, focused on making your life as an AL developer a little bit easier.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">The AL Extension Pack</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The smallest tool that Waldo ever built is the <span class="packt_screen">Visual Studio Code | Extension Packs</span>. In fact, it's a collection of all of the <span class="packt_screen">Visual Studio Code</span> extensions that Waldo values and uses in everyday development tasks.</p>
<p>You can find the <span class="packt_screen">Extension Packs</span> on the Marketplace under the name <span class="packt_screen">AL Extension Pack</span>. Here is a direct link:</p>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=waldo.al-extension-pack">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=waldo.al-extension-pack</a></p>
<p>This is what the home page looks like:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/7bdff342-32f5-41cd-bae4-1caa35c34866.png"/></p>
<p>By simply installing this extension, it will automatically install all extensions that are in the pack, and when Waldo adds an extension, it will automatically be installed on your system as well.</p>
<p>There's also a similar package that we highly recommend installing if you want to have a full-featured Visual Studio Code environment:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/07f95b71-c4e3-45a8-b9bf-df374bca0b2b.png"/></p>
<p>You can find this tool at the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=StefanoDemiliani.sd-extpack-d365bc">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=StefanoDemiliani.sd-extpack-d365bc</a></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">The CRS AL Language Extension</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>A somewhat bigger extension that Waldo has written for the community is the <strong>CRS AL Language Extension</strong>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/e3d26504-2b2e-4ebd-90c8-0b9e5b9c9f94.png" style="width:17.00em;height:21.08em;"/></p>
<p>The extension can be found at the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=waldo.crs-al-language-extension">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=waldo.crs-al-language-extension</a></p>
<p>The main reason why so many people are using it is that it manages filename conventions: developers don't have to worry anymore about how to name their files—this extension can take care of that automatically. But it does a lot more. </p>
<p>Let's have an overview of its functionality.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Run objects</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>We all know that we can run a table or page whenever we publish an app by changing some settings in the <kbd>launch.json</kbd> file. But that's not convenient.</p>
<p>In a way, we need to be able to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run any object in the windows, web, tablet, or phone client.</li>
<li>Run some tools directly, such as the following:
<ul>
<li>Test Tool</li>
<li>Event Subscribers</li>
<li>Database Locks Page</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run the current object that is open in the client.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <kbd>launch.json</kbd> way of running objects isn't going to help us here.</p>
<p>The CRS AL Language Extension comes with these new commands, which can be found in the command palette:</p>
<ul>
<li>CRS: Run Object (Web Client).</li>
<li>CRS: Run Object (Tablet Client).</li>
<li>CRS: Run Object (Phone Client).</li>
<li>CRS: Run Object (Windows Client).</li>
<li>CRS: Run Current Object (Web Client) (<em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Shift</em> + <em>R</em>)—this runs the object from the open file (the extension needs to be published first). You can also run this command from the status bar (<span class="packt_screen">Run In Web Client</span>) and the context menu from the explorer.</li>
<li>CRS: Run CAL Test Tool in Web Client.</li>
<li>CRS: Run Event Subscribers Page in Web Client.</li>
<li>CRS: Run Database Locks Page in Web Client.</li>
</ul>
<p>The nice thing is it will find the settings in <kbd>launch.json</kbd> and use these to run the actual objects.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Renaming/reorganizing files</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As mentioned earlier, this is the most widely used functionality of the tool:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>Renaming</kbd> is renaming the file.</li>
<li><kbd>Reorganizing</kbd> is renaming the file <kbd>AND</kbd> placing it in a subfolder that matches its object type.</li>
</ul>
<p>The essence is captured in four commands that are again available from the Visual Studio Code command palette:</p>
<ul>
<li>CRS: Rename – Current File.</li>
<li>CRS: Rename – All Files.</li>
<li>CRS: Reorganize – Current File.</li>
<li>CRS: CRS: Reorganize – All Files<span>—n</span>ote that <kbd>Reorganize</kbd> will move a test codeunit to the test folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's also a setting to start the file renaming/reorganizing automatically when saving a <kbd>.al</kbd> file:</p>
<pre>"<strong>CRS.OnSaveAlFileAction</strong>": "Rename"</pre>
<p>Another interesting functionality of rename/reorganize is the ability to change the patterns of filenames:</p>
<pre>"<strong>CRS.FileNamePattern</strong>": "&lt;ObjectNameShort&gt;.&lt;ObjectTypeShort&gt;&lt;ObjectId&gt;.al",<br/> "<strong>CRS.FileNamePatternExtensions</strong>": "&lt;ObjectNameShort&gt;.&lt;ObjectTypeShort&gt;&lt;BaseId&gt;-Ext&lt;ObjectId&gt;.al",<br/> "<strong>CRS.FileNamePatternPageCustomizations</strong>": "&lt;ObjectNameShort&gt;.&lt;ObjectTypeShort&gt;&lt;BaseId&gt;-PageCust.al"</pre>
<p>Here is an overview of all of the available tool settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>CRS.nstfolder</kbd>: This is the folder of the NST.</li>
<li><kbd>CRS.WebServerInstancePort</kbd>: This is the port number for the web client.</li>
<li><kbd>CRS.WinServer</kbd>: This is the server that the Windows client is connecting to.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><kbd>CRS.WinServerInstance</kbd>: This is the server instance that the windows client is connecting to.</li>
<li><kbd>CRS.WinServerInstancePort</kbd>: This is the port number of the server instance that the Windows client is connecting to.</li>
<li><kbd>CRS.PublicWebBaseUrl</kbd>: Override <kbd>Launch.json</kbd> settings with this setting if necessary to run objects from VS Code.</li>
<li><kbd>CRS.ExtensionObjectNamePattern</kbd>: This is the pattern for the object name; if set (it's not set by default), it will perform an automatic object name for extension objects:
<ul>
<li><kbd>&lt;Prefix&gt;</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>&lt;Suffix&gt;</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>&lt;ObjectType&gt;</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>&lt;ObjectTypeShort&gt;</kbd>: A short notation of the object type</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;ObjectTypeShortUpper&gt;</kbd>: The same as <kbd>ObjectTypeShort</kbd> but uppercase</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;ObjectId&gt;</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>&lt;BaseName&gt;</kbd>: Weird <span>characters</span> are removed—does NOT include prefix or suffix</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;BaseNameShort&gt;</kbd>: Does NOT include prefix or suffix</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;BaseId&gt;</kbd>: If you want this to work, you need to put <kbd>Id</kbd> in a comment after the base name</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><kbd>CRS.FileNamePattern</kbd>: This is the pattern of the filename for non-extension objects. These variables can be used:
<ul>
<li><kbd>&lt;Prefix&gt;</kbd>: Just the prefix separately</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;Suffix&gt;</kbd>: Just the suffix separately</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;ObjectType&gt;</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>&lt;ObjectTypeShort&gt;</kbd>: A short notation of the object type</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;ObjectTypeShortUpper&gt;</kbd>: The same as <kbd>ObjectTypeShort</kbd> but uppercase</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;ObjectId&gt;</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>&lt;ObjectName&gt;</kbd>: Weird <span>characters</span> are removed, including prefix and suffix</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;ObjectNameShort&gt;</kbd></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><kbd>CRS.FileNamePatternExtensions</kbd>: This is the pattern of the filename for extension objects. These <span>variables </span>can be used:
<ul>
<li><kbd>&lt;Prefix&gt;</kbd>: Just the prefix separately</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;Suffix&gt;</kbd>: Just the suffix separately</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;ObjectType&gt;</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>&lt;ObjectTypeShort&gt;</kbd>: A short notation of the object type</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;ObjectTypeShortUpper&gt;</kbd>: The same as <kbd>ObjectTypeShort</kbd> but uppercase</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;ObjectId&gt;</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>&lt;ObjectName&gt;</kbd>: Weird <span>characters</span> are removed, including prefix and suffix</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;ObjectNameShort&gt;</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>&lt;BaseName&gt;</kbd>: Weird <span>characters</span> are removed, but this does not include prefix nor suffix</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;BaseNameShort&gt;</kbd>: Does not include prefix nor suffix</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;BaseId&gt;</kbd>: If you want this to work, you need to put <kbd>Id</kbd> in a comment after the base name, like in this example:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre style="padding-left: 120px">tableextension 50100 "Just Some Table Extension" extends Customer //18<br/>{<br/>    fields<br/>    {<br/>        // Add changes to table fields here<br/>        field(50100;"Just Some field";Code[10]){<br/>            TableRelation="Just Some Table"."No.";<br/>        }<br/>    }   <br/>}</pre>
<ul>
<li><kbd>CRS.FileNamePatternPageCustomizations</kbd>: This is the pattern of the filename for page customizations. These <span>variables </span>can be used:
<ul>
<li><kbd>&lt;Prefix&gt;</kbd>: Just the prefix separately</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;Suffix&gt;</kbd><span>: J</span>ust the suffix separately</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;ObjectType&gt;</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>&lt;ObjectTypeShort&gt;</kbd><span>: A</span> short notation of the object type</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;ObjectTypeShortUpper&gt;</kbd><span>: </span>The same as <kbd>ObjectTypeShort</kbd> but uppercase</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;ObjectName&gt;</kbd><span>: We</span>ird <span>characters</span> are removed—includes prefix and suffix</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;ObjectNameShort&gt;</kbd><span>: I</span>ncludes prefix and suffix</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;BaseName&gt;</kbd><span>: W</span>eird <span>characters</span> are removed and does NOT include prefix nor suffix</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;BaseNameShort&gt;</kbd><span>: D</span>oes NOT include prefix nor suffix</li>
<li><kbd>&lt;BaseId&gt;</kbd><span>: S</span>ame remarks as before</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><kbd>CRS.ObjectNamePrefix</kbd>: When using the reorganize/rename commands, this setting will make sure the object name (and filename) will have a prefix:
<ul>
<li>Tip 1: Use as a workspace setting</li>
<li>Tip 2: Use an ending space if you want the prefix to be separated by a space</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><kbd>CRS.ObjectNameSuffix</kbd>: When using the reorganize/rename commands, this setting will make sure the object name (and filename) has a suffix:
<ul>
<li>Tip 1: Use as a workspace setting</li>
<li>Tip 2: Use a start space if you want the suffix to be separated by a space</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><kbd>CRS.RemovePrefixFromFilename</kbd>: When using the reorganize/rename commands, this setting will remove any prefix from the filename (but keep it in the object name). Tip: Use as a workspace setting.</li>
<li><kbd>CRS.RemoveSuffixFromFilename</kbd>: When using the reorganize/rename commands, this setting will remove any suffix from the filename (but keep it in the object name). Tip: Use as a workspace setting.</li>
<li><kbd>CRS.AlSubFolderName</kbd>: This is the variable subfolder name. "None" means you want to disable the command to move files to a subfolder.</li>
<li><kbd>CRS.OnSaveAlFileAction</kbd>: This will automatically rename/reorganize the file you are editing. This takes into account the prefix/suffix as well.</li>
<li><kbd>DisableDefaultAlSnippets</kbd>: This disables the default snippets that come with the <kbd>Microsoft.al-language</kbd> extension. When you change the setting, you need to restart Visual Studio Code twice—once to disable the snippets on activation (at that time, the snippets are still loaded), and once to not load the snippets anymore.</li>
<li><kbd>DisableCRSSnippets</kbd>: This disables the CRS snippets that come with this extension. When you change the setting, you need to restart Visual Studio Code twice<span>—</span>once to disable the snippets on activation (at that time, the snippets are still loaded), and once to not load the snippets anymore.</li>
<li><kbd>RenameWithGit</kbd>: Use <kbd>git mv</kbd> to rename a file. This keeps the history of the file but stages the rename, which you should commit separately. <strong>The feature is still in preview-mode, therefore the default value is</strong> <kbd>false</kbd><strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>A small addition, but very handy when coding, is being able to <span>easily</span><span> </span><span>find documentation using two new commands in the command palette:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>CRS: Search Microsoft Docs</li>
<li>CRS: Search Google</li>
</ul>
<p>It will take the selected word, and search that word on Google or Microsoft Docs, with Business Central as the main topic.</p>

<p>Last, but definitely not least, several snippets are included in the CRS AL Language extension.</p>
<p>First of all, there are improved versions of the Microsoft snippets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed unused triggers</li>
<li>Improved tab stops</li>
<li>Improved uncompilable code</li>
<li>Removed default global variables</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>There are also new snippets that implement some default design patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>tmynotifications</kbd> (CRS): The implementation of my notifications for your own notifications</li>
<li><kbd>tassistedsetup</kbd> (CRS): The implementation of the assisted setup for your own wizards</li>
<li><kbd>tcodeunit</kbd> (CRS Method): Snippets for implementing a default encapsulated method design pattern that implements an <kbd>OnBefore</kbd> and <kbd>OnAfter</kbd> event by default</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a good thing to explore all snippets and familiarize yourself with them.</p>

<p>The goal of <kbd>WaldoNavPad</kbd> has always been to be able to easily work with an unlimited amount of text by easily splitting the text into pieces to save in a Business Central (or NAV) database (not just by saving it as a BLOB, but as text) so that you can still filter and search for parts of the texts. </p>
<p>On top of this, the text should be split intelligently by preserving paragraphs, carriage returns, and full words. This still preserves the format of the text as much as possible, which makes it as readable as possible in the small field lengths that NAV had at its disposal.</p>

<p>The latest version of <kbd>WaldoNavPad</kbd> can be found on Waldo's GitHub:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/waldo1001/Waldo.NAV.Pad">https://github.com/waldo1001/Waldo.NAV.Pad</a></p>
<p>It can easily be downloaded, forked, or cloned from there.</p>
<p>If you do so, you'll have the AL code of an app that implements <kbd>WaldoNavPad</kbd>:</p>

<p>This set of files is intended to allow you to copy, renumber, rename, and do more to your own project. It's not intended to be created as an app, nor has it been uploaded to AppSource, so you can use it as a dependency from your own app.</p>

<p>Once in Visual Studio Code, the app builds and publishes as is. You can simply create your <kbd>launch.json</kbd>, download the symbols, and build the app right away. This will get you to the <span class="packt_screen">Customer List</span> page, where there are the following two new actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Open WaldoNAVPad Text</span>: A normal page with a multiline textbox to handle large texts</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Open WaldoNAVPad HTML</span>: A JavaScript-based HTML editor (based on TinyMCE)</li>
</ul>
<p>The actions appear as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b24d2744-2bcb-4d55-8565-6025b7f082f5.png" style="width:32.83em;height:14.08em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Here is the text editor on the normal page:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3b240969-8ba7-4843-a79c-5136e374638e.png" style="width:26.50em;height:10.75em;"/></p>
<p>The HTML text editor is as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/e0f3bda7-fe66-48f4-a6b9-13999d65efef.png" style="width:66.67em;height:41.50em;"/></p>
<p>Next, let's see how the background for the text appears.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>When you dive into the code, you'll see that the app consists of two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NAVpad Handling</strong>: This subfolder contains the code to handle the NAVpad. The idea is you only use the <span><kbd>WaldoNAVPad</kbd> Class </span>codeunit, where you can show/save/get the texts from the NAVpad. To save the texts, it will use the text handling functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Text Handling</strong>: This subfolder contains the code to intelligently handle the texts that have to be saved to the database or have to be loaded from the database. If you want to use the NAVPad text-tables, there is no need to use these methods. However, if you want to save texts to your own table, you can simply use the functions in the <span><kbd>WaldoNAVPad</kbd> Text Class </span>codeunit, which lets you get text and loop through it to save it to your own tables.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">By looping through your text, the system is going to cut sentences at spaces or carriage returns to preserve the formatting of your text as much as possible.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">In the following example, you see the NAVPad Handling routine looping through the text to save the text:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/075dd6a5-8ce8-4105-80a4-d7e9bb82f053.png"/></p>
<p>By default, the system saves the text in two tables:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>WaldoNAVPad</kbd> Blobstore: This is a table with formatted HTML tags to preserve all of the formatting the user has been doing to the text.</li>
<li><kbd>WaldoNAVPad</kbd> Textstore: This is a table where all of the HTML tags are stripped to be able to show it <span>decently </span>in Business Central.</li>
</ul>
<p>To show the content of these tables, the app has two pages in the <kbd>_JustForTexting</kbd> folder:</p>
<ul>
<li>page 82,150 WaldoNAVPad Blobs</li>
<li>page 82,149 WaldoNAVPad Texts</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of how the records are saved by running the page called <span class="packt_screen">WaldoNAVPad Texts</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2e2ea6a1-8cd2-48f0-9c5b-5d7e275c55c9.png"/></p>
<p>Next, we will see how to implement these actions.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>

            <article>
                
<p>To show you how to implement this in your own business logic, the app has a <kbd>_JustForTesting</kbd> <span>subfolder</span>, which contains a page extension for page 22 (<span class="packt_screen">Customer List</span>) that shows how you can simply create an action on a page and implement <kbd>WaldoNAVPad</kbd> by calling the class functions:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/adfbdb05-5721-4fab-806c-960572909af2.png" style="width:46.50em;height:19.42em;"/></p>
<p>The <kbd>Initialize</kbd> function will load the text that is linked to the current record. The <kbd>ShowAndSaveTexts</kbd> method will show the texts (in this case, in the HTML editor) if the user chooses to see it.</p>

<p>A not-so-important, but rather interesting, repository of Waldo is something he calls <em>the most useless app ever</em>. It is an AL app intended for demos, prototyping, tryouts, or tests—you name it. It contains a lot of different tryouts and demos of different parts and topics of AL development.</p>
<p>A few examples of this are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Translations</li>
<li>The different .NET wrappers</li>
<li>Some editing hacks to work with Visual Studio Code</li>
<li>Included SQL files to check the tables of an app</li>
<li>Publish web services</li>
<li>Included HTTP files to check web services</li>
<li>Function overloading</li>
<li>The Tenant Management codeunit</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find <kbd>MostUselessAppEver</kbd> on Waldo's GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/waldo1001/MostUselessAppEver">https://github.com/waldo1001/MostUselessAppEver</a>.</p>
<p>You can simply clone the repository and start working with it. There is not a single piece of business logic that is useful, but it will show you some tricks to work with AL development.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, Waldo has been diving into PowerShell quite heavily. There has been a strong focus on C/AL and merging, upgrading, and all that, but for AL, there hasn't been much need in terms of PowerShell (yet).</p>
<p>Still, let's point out a few areas in his scripts that can be of any use in terms of AL development.</p>

<p>All of Waldo's PowerShell modules and scripts can be found on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/waldo1001/Cloud.Ready.Software.PowerShell">https://github.com/waldo1001/Cloud.Ready.Software.PowerShell</a>.</p>
<p>You will see two folders:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>PSModules</kbd>: This contains all of the code for the modules. These modules can be found on the PowerShell Gallery as well: <a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages?q=waldo">https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages?q=waldo</a>.</li>
<li><kbd>PSScripts</kbd>: This contains scripts that mostly put the functions of these modules to work.</li>

<p>Waldo has been using Docker in quite a number of ways. First, he ran a Windows 2016 Server VM on his laptop, where he had installed Docker—so, in a way, it was a remote Docker host. Then, he moved to Docker on his own PC, which simplified the development experience a bit. All of his scripts to manage Docker are in the <kbd>PSScripts</kbd>/<kbd>NAVDocker</kbd> folder. </p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Here, you find scripts to create containers, but also to work with apps in these Docker containers, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>CleanApp</kbd>: This will remove all apps from a Docker container.</li>
<li><kbd>InstallApp</kbd>: This will install an app with PowerShell.</li>
<li><kbd>ExportObjectsAsAL</kbd>: This will export objects as an AL file. It's very convenient to use for reports, which you can export, rename, and replace easily.</li>
</ul>

<p>In another repository (<kbd>blog.CALAnalysis</kbd>), Waldo has been documenting all of the publishers from a certain version of NAV or Business Central, which results in a file that lists all of the event publishers and where they are called.</p>
<p>Following is an example of the publishers:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/55221a07-06a4-4972-a857-438a33f790d1.png"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>This is where they are called:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/46e2d0e9-d4d5-4d4a-a05c-eb128c0fe342.png"/></p>
<p>Quite a lot of people refer to this for trying to find out that the event that they are about to use is actually being called on the place they expect.</p>

<p><strong>ALOps</strong> is the current tool Waldo is working on. The goal of this tool is to provide the easiest way possible for Dynamics 365 Business Central partners to set up build and release pipelines in Azure DevOps.</p>
<p>In essence, build and release pipelines are a crucial part of <strong><span>continuous integration/continuous deployment</span></strong> (<strong>CI/CD</strong>), but very far from the daily knowledge of an AL developer. <kbd>ALOps</kbd> is there to close that bridge: with very limited knowledge, you can set up your own build pipeline in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p><strong>ALOps</strong> is a DevOps extension that is available on the Marketplace for Azure DevOps:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d9fedc9d-97c7-4c57-914f-240ff1f0d79a.png"/></p>
<p>And it is free for any open source repository. </p>
<p>The extension is actually a structured collection of PowerShell scripts. And the nice thing is, the user does not have to have any PowerShell knowledge to set up the most complex build pipeline, including the signing of apps, compilations, tests, and so on.</p>

<p>As <kbd>ALOps</kbd> is there to set up pipelines, it includes what we call steps. The steps it includes today are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile app</li>
<li>Sign app</li>
<li>Verify signed app</li>
<li>Publish app</li>
<li>Test app</li>
<li>Clean apps from the environment</li>
<li>Copy app between environments</li>
<li>Import a RapidStart package</li>
<li>Import a license</li>
<li>Build a Docker container</li>
<li>Wait for a Docker container to finish building</li>
<li>Remove a Docker container</li>
<li>Import <strong>for side-by-side development</strong> (<strong><span>fob</span></strong>)</li>
<li>Export objects (<kbd>txt</kbd> or <kbd>fob</kbd>)</li>
<li>Compile (C/AL)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these steps work on Docker or non-Docker environments if you wish.</p>

<p>The <kbd>WaldoNavPad</kbd> app we talked about earlier is actually set up with a working build pipeline in Azure DevOps, even while the repository of <kbd>WaldoNavPad</kbd> is on GitHub. Waldo has set it up in this public repository:</p>
<p><a href="https://dev.azure.com/msdyn365bc/WaldoGitHubBuilds/">https://dev.azure.com/msdyn365bc/WaldoGitHubBuilds/</a></p>
<p>Just navigate to the builds and click one of the builds to see the details:</p>
