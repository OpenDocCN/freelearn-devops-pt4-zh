<p class="mce-root"><strong><span>Infrastructure </span>as Code</strong>, more commonly known as <strong>IaC</strong>, is a practice that is a pillar of DevOps culture. IaC entails writing your desired architecture configuration in code. Among other advantages, IaC allows the automation of infrastructure deployments, which reduces or eliminates the need for manual intervention, and thus the risk of configuration errors, and the need to create templates and standardize infrastructure with modular and scalable code.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Among all the DevOps tools, there are many that allow IaC. One of them is <strong>Terraform</strong>, from HashiCorp, which is very popular today because, in addition to being open source and multi-platform, it has the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root">It allows you to preview the changes that will be applied to your infrastructure.</li>
<li class="mce-root">It allows the parallelization of operations, taking into account the management of dependencies.</li>
<li class="mce-root">It has a multitude of providers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root">In this book dedicated to Terraform, we will first discuss the installation of Terraform for local development, the writing of Terraform configurations, and the construction of several environments in a dynamic way.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Then, we will learn how to use the Terraform <strong>command-line interface</strong> (<strong>CLI</strong>) and how to share and use Terraform modules.</p>
<p>Once configuration writing and commands in Terraform are understood, we will discuss Terraform's practical use for building infrastructure in one of the leading cloud providers, Azure.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Finally, we will finish this book by looking at advanced uses of Terraform, including Terraform testing, integrating Terraform into a <strong>continuous integration/continuous deployment</strong> (<strong>CI/CD</strong>) pipeline, and using Terraform Cloud, which is Terraform's collaboration platform for teams and companies.</p>
<p>This book will guide you through several recipes on best practices for writing Terraform configurations and commands, and it will also cover recipes on Terraform's integration with other tools, such as Terragrunt, kitchen-terraform, and Azure Pipelines.</p>
<p>Most of the Terraform configurations described in this book are based on the Azure provider for illustration, but you can apply these recipes for all other Terraform providers.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In writing this book, which is in a cookbook format, I wanted to share my experience of real and practical Terraform-based scenarios that I have been able to acquire by working with customers and companies for several years.</p>
<h1 id="uuid-f78cdf62-f13e-4d0d-b8a9-b87b6dfaad0b">Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is intended for everyone who already knows the basics about IaC and DevOps culture and also has some basic knowledge of Terraform. The book does not require any development or operating system experience.</p>

<p><a href="027d2973-b820-4fba-b43e-ee2747a97e6a.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Setting Up the Terraform Environment</em>, details the different ways of installing Terraform manually, with scripts, or by using a Docker container, and it also details the Terraform <span>migration </span>configuration process.</p>
<p><a href="3099c9ac-8c38-4e7d-8146-411fac26a2b7.xhtml">Chapter 2</a><span>, <em>Writing Terraform Configuration</em></span><span>, concerns the writing of Terraform configurations for a provider, variables, outputs, external data, built-in functions, condition expressions, file manipulation, and the execution of local programs with Terraform.</span></p>
<p><a href="d019fed0-6c22-4da8-9796-58d45feafa2c.xhtml">Chapter 3</a><span>, <em>Building Dynamic Environments with Terraform</em></span><span>, discusses building dynamic environments with Terraform by going further with Terraform configuration writing using loops, maps, and collections. </span></p>
<p><a href="fc591e87-b893-40fa-9021-7827bffcc094.xhtml">Chapter 4</a><span>, <em>Using the Terraform CLI</em></span><span>, explains the use of Terraform's CLI to clean code, destroy resources provisioned by Terraform, use workspaces, import existing resources, generate dependency graphs, and debug the execution of Terraform.</span></p>
<p><a href="ddb13a41-5cdd-4931-b38f-d185d3a10c1e.xhtml">Chapter 5</a><span>, <em>Sharing Terraform Configuration with Modules</em></span><span>, covers the creation, use, and sharing of Terraform modules. It also shows testing module practices and the implementation of CI/CD pipelines for Terraform modules.</span></p>
<p><a href="d054157b-d534-47c9-8079-3af13107c4ef.xhtml">Chapter 6</a><span>, <em>Provisioning Azure Infrastructure with Terraform</em></span><span>, illustrates the use of Terraform in a practical scenario of the cloud provider Azure. It covers topics such as authentication, remote backends, ARM templates, Azure CLI execution, and Terraform configuration generation for an existing infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><a href="905f7886-2827-44fe-af8c-4f9f3e3a9cef.xhtml">Chapter 7</a><span>, <em>Deep Diving into Terraform</em></span><span>, discusses topics that go further with Terraform, such as the execution of Terraform configuration tests, zero-downtime deployment, Terraform wrappers with Terragrunt, and the implementation of CI/CD pipelines to execute Terraform configurations.</span></p>
<p><a href="7a338622-bf1e-4c4b-9c08-88eb36f079da.xhtml">Chapter 8</a><span>, <em>Using Terraform Cloud to Improve Collaboration</em></span><span>, explains the use of Terraform Cloud to run Terraform in a team with the sharing of Terraform modules in a private registry, the use of remote backends for Terraform state, running Terraform remotely, and writing compliance tests with Sentinel.</span></p>
